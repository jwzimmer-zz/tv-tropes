Sometimes they allow you to do something suicidally dangerous (or at least utterly pointless) and, far from forcing you to face the consequences of your actions, they <em>reward</em> you for this behavior. This is a Violation of Common Sense; one does not expect to be rewarded for otherwise nonsensical actions.
</p><p>Sometimes this is an unexpected result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGamePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGamePhysics">Video Game Physics</a>, but just as often it's a deliberate solution to a puzzle or a way to collect useful items. As always, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Not Bad</a> — a Violation of Common Sense can be entertaining and amusing when well-executed, just as it can be confusing or annoying when not properly set up.
</p><p>Compare and contrast both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie">Press X to Die</a> (where an obviously stupid action has harmful results), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Stupidity Is the Only Option</a> (where the player is <em>forced</em> to do something stupid in order to continue the game), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyRealisticGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedlyRealisticGameplay">Unexpectedly Realistic Gameplay</a> (where <em>following</em> common sense is expected, but surprising in the context of the game). Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">Moon Logic Puzzle</a> (where the solution to a puzzle makes absolutely no sense from a normal standpoint).

<ul><li> An early section in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> requires you to save a doctor who's trapped in a room whose only exit is into a room full of Joker Toxin. You have to activate the three ventilation fans by hitting their power boxes with your Batarang. The problem? One of those boxes is itself in an enclosed room. The correct solution is to Batarang the rope that one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> is hanging from, knocking him down through the roof of the room and right into the cloud of poison gas. Even though you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, and Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">never kills</a>. On the other hand, Joker Toxin isn't instantly lethal, and there's a line of dialogue about how you have to act quickly to save his life, so there's some explanation at least.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CaveStory">Cave Story</a></em>, you see Professor Booster in mortal peril, and you have the option to either go help him, or just leave him to his fate. Your decision determines whether he lives or dies from his injuries. Except the results are the opposite of what you would expect: If you go to help, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostDeadGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostDeadGuy">he gives one last speech and then dies</a>; but if you leave him, he <em>recovers on his own</em> and catches up with you later. In fact, the only way to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get the best ending</span> is to ignore him. Though it does have a degree of logic to it. There's a busted teleporter at the bottom of the hole he's stuck in, seeing as he teleports to you should you ignore him, it's implied that if you two never meet there, he clings to life and moves around a bit, discovering the teleporter and using it to get to safety and living long enough to upgrade the jetpack. However if you meet him at that time he gives you the jetpack he currently has and dies there thinking he's done all he can do for you. Of course, there's absolutely no way to know this beforehand hence the violation part.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoVacation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoVacation">Go Vacation</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotActuallyCosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotActuallyCosmeticAward">Golden Key</a> called "Big Ball of Painful Memories,'' which you get by repeatedly violating common sense. It requires you to crash your vehicle into water 50 times, flub a trick 50 times, and, most dauntingly, jump off 4 secret special cliffs. One of which is a two-hundred-foot-tall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">waterfall</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pretend you're <em>way</em> above the ground with the paraglider in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>, you're almost out of stamina, and the fall from this height will kill you. What do? Put away the paraglider, fall to the ground like a meteor, and save that last little bit of stamina to reopen it the second before you hit the ground. Falling from 1000 feet and hitting the ground with that amount of force? Lethal. Falling from 1000 feet and putting the strain of all that force on Link's arms? Harmless.
</li><li> There's an unusual method to avoiding ReDeads in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>: Equipping the Iron Boots before getting close. ReDeads detect you based on sound, not sight. The Iron Boots are clunky and noisy...to the player. But the ReDeads will ignore you. This is because the game registers the sound of Link's slower walking animation differently from that of his regular walking- as far as the game is concerned if you're moving slowly, you're tiptoeing, even if you're actually plodding around with heavy weights on your feet. As long as you don't pull out or put away a weapon, you'll be completely invisible to them (Alternatively, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">this can be interpreted as the Iron Boots being so loud that they deafen/blind them)</a>.
</li><li> Also in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, the Death Mountain Crater is so hot that if you don't leave before the time expires, you'll instantly die unless you wear the Goron Tunic. Falling into the lava is like falling into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pit</a>, thus the game resets you back to the last entrance you came in from. Savvy players that are speed running or simply wanting to save time can jump into the lava to reset the timer and act as a quick warp to the exit with only a loss of one heart. The heat of the crater is more deadly than the lava itself!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a part where you're on an oil-covered bridge that is ignited by an archer mook. With no apparent way out, you push a conveniently located crate over to the side of the bridge and jump off into (the almost entirely dry) Lake Hylia below. It's a good thing Link <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">doesn't have to worry about smashing into the surface of the lake</a>.
</li><li> In general, the first time Link decides that jumping off a high cliff with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp">cucco</a> over his head is a good idea.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaI">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> has "Pay me and I'll talk" NPCs. Obviously, the lowest option doesn't net you any info since you're a cheap-ass for picking it, so logically, picking the highest option is the best since it means you're willing to pay anything for information, right? Nope! The NPC says "Boy, you're rich!" and that's it. To get an actual hint, you have to pick the middle option.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1">Metroid 1</a></em>, there exist quite a few expansions and power ups hidden under fake pools of acid or lava, most of which you have to go out of your way to fall in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> at certain points, usually when Amaterasu has to jump down a hole. This is done to the point of Issun claiming that their motto is "Leap before you think." This <em>would</em> be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the fact that Ammy is a god, but there are some falls that won't kill you and some that <em>will.</em> Sometimes Issun reciting his motto is the only indication that you won't die if you jump right there.
<ul><li> There are several methods of teleporting, <em>none of which</em> Amaterasu can use to reach Oni Island before it disappears. Absolutely no reason is given why, Issun just yells that Amaterasu doesn't have time for such "distractions". In a game where using magic to succeed is necessary at many points, running on foot through an entire city just seems arbitrary.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em>: During some levels, when triggering boulder traps, you must violate all instinct by sprinting <em>towards</em> the object about to crush Lara before ducking at a small raised step on its path, allowing the boulder to pass over Lara safely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheLastRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheLastRevelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a></em> has you play a mini-game against a spirit before you can progress. You move on whether you win or lose, but the path you take for losing has one of the many game's secrets. If you plan to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, you have to lose the mini-game on purpose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderChronicles">Tomb Raider Chronicles</a></em> has a door that can only be unlocked with two keycards and you have to convince a worker at gunpoint to use his keycard in tandem with yours. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Killing him</a> opens up an alternate and more difficult path while your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">partner</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">chews you out for killing the hapless worker</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Adventure Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One of the early puzzles in the original text adventure <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ColossalCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ColossalCave">Colossal Cave</a></em> is shown in the page quote. This puzzle is actually much, much harder to any modern gamer than it was at the time, since "With what? Your bare hands?" has become the default response to attempts to kill something without specifying a weapon (it was in Adventure, too, but at least it was new enough there to make players think about it — today, nobody is likely to consider treating it as a real question).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Infocom">Infocom</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>:
<ul><li> To pass one obstacle you first had to remove your common sense in order to be carrying both tea <em>and</em> no tea at the same time (something your common sense tells you can't do).
</li><li> You are <em>required</em> to enter in an illegal command at a certain point in the game. As anyone who plays a text game can tell you, normally, you do <em>not</em> want to do that.
</li><li> Douglas Adams loves this trope. His adventure game Starship Titanic also has several examples.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a Christian text adventure called "Keys to the Kingdom" where you have to deliberately try to walk across a river that is trying to block you. At first the game will tell you that you can't go that way, but if you try again, you'll make it across because you had faith (ala Peter walking on water for a bit when Jesus told him he could). Just don't look down!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVIHeirTodayGoneTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVIHeirTodayGoneTomorrow">King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow</a></em>, the player must cross a boiling pond, defeat a living statue, and cut down an ever-growing hedge, all without a good reason. He ends up on the grounds of a castle. The castle's owner points out that he clearly wanted privacy, and the player character can only suppose that he breaks through traps because it's what he does. The owner's had enough adventures to know how they go, so he sighs and accepts the explanation.
</li><li> Several actions the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonkeyIsland">Monkey Island</a></em> adventure games require you to take are questionable in their wisdom. Over the course of the series, Guybrush has: ridden a rope across a chasm using a rubber chicken (with a pulley in the middle), deliberately mixed medications to put himself in a coma (twice), fired himself out of a cannon (thrice), triggered a volcanic eruption at point-blank range, soaked an irritable undead pirate with root beer, and gotten himself eaten by a giant snake, only to escape in a common-sense violating manner ... Thankfully, the games make it almost impossible to lose, no matter what you do, so the player can experiment without fear. Let's face it, the <em>Monkey Island</em> series was one big Violation Of Common Sense. You're supposed to start the game, solve the first puzzle, realize that common sense just doesn't work in the <em>Monkey Island</em> world, and then gleefully throw all good judgment out the window and just try the most outlandish things you can think of. It's more fun that way.
<ul><li> One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">most infamous puzzles</a> in the series (and the only one where you <em>can</em> actually die if you fail to solve it) comes when Guybrush is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CementShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CementShoes">thrown off a pier into the water with a heavy stone idol tied to his ankle</a>. Fortunately Guybrush can hold his breath for 10 minutes (which gives you a 10 minute time limit to solve it) but while any number of sharp objects you could use to cut the rope are scattered around near you, none are within reach. The solution? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Pick up the idol</em> and store it in your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a> like any other item, leaving you free to just walk out of the water!</span>

The most famous (though technically optional) are probably the various uses of the baby you find, including throwing him into a lake. Inexplicably, the baby then swims out, carrying a useful item.

Once you have the complete set and assemble them on a hospital bed, the protagonist will remark that she had no idea why she did all that.

Later on you reach a gap in the floor with a contextual inventory use icon over it, but you haven't picked up any planks or ladders or other things that could serve as a bridge. You're actually supposed to use the wristwatch, which is suddenly and inexplicably twenty times the size it was when you picked it up, to serve as a makeshift bridge by stretching its wristband over the gap. Then again, this is a game where you're trapped in a series of surreal nightmares- <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealDreamsAreWeirder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealDreamsAreWeirder">real-world logic has no power here</a>.

<ul><li> The main mechanic of the Portalcraft class of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shadowverse">Shadowverse</a></em> is special token cards called Artifacts. They have powerful stats and abilities for their play point cost; however, rather than being summoned to the field or added to the hand, Artifacts are added to the player's deck. Anyone who knows the basics of collectable card games can see how this can backfire since adding more cards to the deck makes it less likely that you'll draw the card you need. However, this ties into the other mechanic of Portalcraft: when the number of cards in the deck is even, certain cards will gain special effects, and adding and searching for Artifacts allows you to manipulate when Resonance activates. In particular, the card <a class="urllink" href="https://shadowverse-portal.com/card/107841030">Deus Ex Machina<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> allows the player to what's normally a stupid idea into a nigh endless wave of value followers, while the deck-filling mechanic safeguards the player from losing by deck-out.

Once his Drive reaches Level 3, you can actually take less damage by just letting it hit you.

<ul><li> Besides ejecting from a jet fighter, you can also get back into the same plane in midair.
</li><li> Can't get an enemy airplane chasing you can off your tail? Simple. Pull your plane into a loop, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOaGhE_sejI">jump out of a plane at the top of the loop, take out an RPG, shoot the enemy plane<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, then get back into your plane as the aircraft comes out of the loop.
</li><li> Or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;v=LrOIgxQ--Tc">jump out of your airplane, aim your sniper rifle at his air intake between your legs, shoot him out of his cockpit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and steal his airplane as it catches up to you.
</li><li> And then if you need to fill an empty seat in a two seater, tell a buddy you are coming to pick him up, dive at him, fly five feet above the ground and zoom at him at 300 MPH. He will either get ready and hit the enter button, comfortably ready to help you destroy your enemies or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">you get docked for fratricide</a>. If it is the latter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist">oh well, just tell him to try it again when he respawns</a>. Note that this was an accepted tactic in <em>Battlefield 1942</em>.

Not only is this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by the weapon's description, but there is a small chance that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveStupidity">it will actually explode</a> when used, killing the player, their target, and everyone else in the general vicinity.

You can choose to decline by getting counseling from a hotline located on a shack near the cliff and save on the thousand or so dollars you'll be charged to respawn in exchange for more XP, or you can go through with it and get paid 12 Eridium. Jack lampshades this, calling you a sellout if you go through with it.
</li><li> Jumping from a ludicrous height, as in contrast to more realistic shooters you take absolutely no damage from the fall. This is lampshaded late-game when Brick suggests you simply jump off the tallest structure in Sawtooth Cauldron to get out of the area faster, and he'll be impressed if you comply. This may well be because in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Brick's native game</a>, there was fall damage.

His skills and abilities actually <em>encourage</em> this sort of reckless insanity, as he gains more strength the more vulnerable he becomes.

</li><li> Similar to Krieg, the Love Thumper Shield (which is often paired with him) is this. Having an above average shield capacity for a Rare-level shield, it also boasts an extremely long recharge rate, so high that if it goes down you might as well stay naked. However, it's a Maylay shield, meaning it boosts melee damage when the shields are down. The idea is you tank damage with the shield until you get into face-beating distance, then beat face until everyone is dead.
</li><li> The Love Thumper's style is mirrored by the "Flame of the Firehawk" legendary shield, only instead of boosting melee damage, it sets off constant waves of fiery death while it's down. It is also paired with Krieg frequently, especially since Krieg has a skill tree entirely about fire.
</li><li> Subverted early in the game where Claptrap suggests that you can get through an electrical barrier if you sprint face-first into it.

</li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">Rocket Jumping</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Trolldier</a> loadout. Replace your primary with a weapon that does no damage (the Rocket Jumper, which is intended as a training tool) and your melee with a very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SituationalSword">Situational Sword</a> (the Market Gardener, which deals crits while rocket jumping), and rocket into enemies to hit them with a shovel before you touch the ground. Adding in the Mantreads takes up your secondary (meaning you have no damage source other than the Market Gardener), but also lets you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a> foes. One of the build's greatest strengths is its unpredictability and lots of surprise burst damage, so expect plays that would make little sense for anyone else.
</li><li> The grenade one is even lampshaded, saying a sober person would just throw it. Ironically, it's an even bigger Violation of Common Sense than the flamethrower: It's the perfect spy-checker since it will definitely kill the interloper, but who goes around smacking his friends with a pressure-trigger grenade?
</li><li> Spy-Checking is also lampshaded in the Meet The Spy video. The BLU Soldier blows the head off of a BLU Spy with a shotgun. When his teammates react with visible shock, he defends himself with "What?! It was obvious! He's the RED Spy!" He then acts confused when the BLU Spy does not turn red after a few seconds. Valve is aware of how shooting at your teammates to find Spies is completely insane - appropriate that they used the most psychotic member of the cast to show us this.
</li><li> Several of the cosmetic items in the game would be extremely impractical and/or dangerous to wear in real life, and this is often lampshaded in their descriptions, such as the description for the Head Warmer pointing out that since the Pyro wears it in combination with his gas mask, the combined heat would cause hallucinations and eventual brain death, and the Googol Glass Eyes pointing out that unclean pieces of metal in his eyes would cause serious infection. Then there's the Bunsen Brave which is basically a feather hat made out of a set of flame throwers a bit too close to the wearer's forehead! Logically this should be excruciating to wear due to the metal frame getting too hot.
</li><li> Some players damage themselves intentionally (such as with explosives or the Scout's Boston Basher/Three-Rune Blade), since Medics build Ubercharge faster if they're actually healing someone instead of simply having their healing beam on someone who has maximum overheal. Some competitive guides even say that Pocket Soldiers should only have maximum overheal if they're seconds away from entering a fight, otherwise they should be constantly damaging themselves to maximize their Medic's build rate.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Half-Life</em> mod <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheyHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheyHunger">They Hunger</a></em>, there is ammunition for the revolver. In a fire. Jump in and out to collect those six rounds!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RisingStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RisingStorm">Rising Storm</a></em>, American and Japanese machine-gunners change their weapons' overheated barrels <em>with their bare hands</em>. Surprisingly, they don't flinch when pulling the smoking-hot barrel out, and instead this action allows their guns to continue firing without penalty.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> has a rather interesting instance of this- in one game event, Rikti (evil alien) ships fly over the city, bombing the hell out of it. It's brutally difficult but just barely possible to kill the bombers. Only thing is, that doesn't give you anything (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">other than a fairly spectacular lightshow</a>), and what you're actually <em>supposed</em> to do for the event is to hunt down bombs that failed to detonate on impact. And then beat them to death with your bare hands (or whatever weapon your hero favors).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonNest">Dragon Nest</a></em> you can get titles for accomplishing certain achievements which can provide you with some extra stats. One title requires you to collect 8 other seemingly pathetic titles that provide no stats whatsoever. To get them, you'll have to kill a goblin you're supposed to protect, get killed by a hound, get run over by a minotaur, get killed by a stone thrown by a blue goblin (whose aim is so bad you actually have to <em>run into the little pebble yourself</em>, get killed by an ogre boss, get killed by hounds again and lastly, get killed by an orc challenger who is afraid to even actually hit you, especially if you're a little higher levelled. And after all this, what do you get? One of the best - if not the best - titles you can get in the game; providing you with 20-25 stats and 40 damage and magic attack. Guess the devs figured that if you managed to get those achievements you're going to need that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">buff</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elsword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elsword">Elsword</a></em> one title requires you <em>to drown</em> just to discover it.

<ul><li> Eureka has monsters that can aggro you based on various factors and they will not stop chasing you unless you cover a <em>lot</em> of distance from where they spawned. In a party, if a player is engaged with a mob and another player performs an action on that player such as healing, that player will also get aggro from that mob. Eureka tends to have very strong mobs, so rather than assisting a fellow party member knowing that you can't keep them alive and risk getting killed yourself, it's better that you let that party member die so that the aggressive mob resets and wanders back to their spawn point. From there, you can revive the player with little trouble.
</li><li> In order to spawn an S-rank hunt target, not only does the timer have to have expired, but players have to participate in certain actions within the area. Some of these are simple, such as killing a certain number of an enemy. Some are a bit more obscure, like mining ore or gathering items within the region. One requires a certain number of items to be discarded; one needs characters to <em>die</em>; one requires players to drop to one HP — and the fastest way to do the lattermost is to leap off a tower repeatedly and enjoy the 'crunch' sound.
</li></ul></li><li> Player characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> are insane.
<ul><li> How would you react if told to "use" a bottle of bubble bath? Easy. <em>Drink it.</em> The game is actually inconsistent about it; when you try this with certain items, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">the game will, in fact, call you an idiot for trying to eat them.</a>
</li><li> There actually is one drink (the world's most unappetizing beverage) whose intended purpose is to make you 'Literally Insane' ... since only someone literally insane would deliberately drink <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their own hair dissolved in depilatory cream</span>.
</li><li> The game does have the advantage of being consistent. If it's bubbly - or fizzy, or the like, then it'll let you recover MP. This does become rather insane, though, when one's snorting beer-soaked teddy bears.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em> you receive the "Unwise" title for eating barrow-brie, which poisons your character so severely you'd need to use healing skills like crazy in order to stay alive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi">Mabinogi</a></em> you can mine sulfur ore and fossils from the sulfur pits in Zardine. If you stay too long you'll get sulfur poisoning which will take your health down past "Deadly". Common sense would tell you to leave before this happens, but if you stay long enough for it to happen you'll get a title for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The socially accepted way to ask for a lift in a friendly vehicle is to shoot it. In a game where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyFireproof">Friendly Fireproof</a> is most certainly not in effect. The reasoning behind this is small arms do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> to vehicles (Sunderers and Galaxies, which are the most common targets, are outright immune), and it lets the driver know that it's him specifically you're trying to catch, whereas the "I need a ride!" voice command could be address to anybody in the general area, so most people ignore it.
</li><li> The best way to take out enemy vehicles for most classes is to run or jetpack (as Light Assault) right next to it, toss C4 explosives and often get yourself killed in the process (you have to be quick about using the detonator before you get gunned down or run over).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the boss battle against Project Sav-Rak, the players face him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RooftopConfrontation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RooftopConfrontation">on a platform suspended high above lava</a>. Bad enough, but he also utilizes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockwaveStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockwaveStomp">Shockwave Stomp</a> that sends players flying, possibly over the edge. So the only safe place? Right where he lands! How far you go flying is based on how far away you are from his impact point. Letting a two-story tall fifty-ton mutant land on you will result in 94% less being dead than staying as far away as humanly possible.
</li><li> On Tatooine, you can obtain the title "Worm Food" for offing yourself in the sarlacc pit.
</li></ul></li><li> Massively multiplayer online third-person shooter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> occasionally makes really <em>dumb</em> decisions into the most tactically sound ones. For instance, there's Harrow, who flagellates himself to buff allies and debuff enemies, at the cost of his own health (something you obviously want to retain). However, he's designed to do that. What the game probably <em>doesn't</em> expect you to do is coming up with creative ways to refresh Rhino's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">Iron Skin</a> ability. Iron Skin cannot be cast until it is completely lost, so 'topping off' is not an option. Instead of continuing to fight as normal and wasting time to return to dropped energy cells when needed, more than one Rhino player has deliberately blown themselves up with a nearby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplodingBarrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplodingBarrel">Exploding Barrel</a>. This doesn't actually hurt Rhino but shaves off those last few points of Iron Skin, allowing him to cast a fresh Iron Skin, take the energy cells, and continue without having to slow down or double back.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, a number of quests depend on this.
<ul><li> One example is that quest in Howling Fjord where you shoot a <em>harpoon</em> off a cliff and over a very cold lake, and <em>ride it like a surfboard into the town below</em>. While it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent">on fire</a></em>. The NPC at the bottom lampshades this, pointing out that you're absolutely out of your mind.
</li><li> The fast exits from the boss rooms of several dungeons also require leaping off intimidating cliffs or into shafts dropping straight down. Later dungeons add water pits at the bottom to soften the blow. Earlier ones require considerable faith that the fall will merely be massively damaging instead of instantly fatal.
</li><li> Blackrock Spire does this best, it has a pitfall that you can jump into and exit the instance. There's one ledge from Upper Blackrock Spire (connected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">the Rookery</a>), where the fall would normally kill you, but the loading screen for exiting the instance cancels the fall damage.
</li><li> The quest chain before you meet Matthias Lehner has you helping the Argent Crusade infiltrate Icecrown Citadel and ends with you activating highly volatile explosives. When you realize you need to get away from the ensuing explosion (they don't actually go off after you activate them, of course) you're encouraged to jump down the shaft in front of you and hope the fall doesn't kill you... not that it does because there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">water</a> below.
</li><li> Some dubious achievements are awarded for mistakes and other stupid things, which leads to players trying to do these intentionally. These achievements include <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=964">falling a huge distance without dying<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, falling a huge distance without dying <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=1260">while drunk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=5518">getting killed by Deathwing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> There's also a quest in Darkshore which you can only <em>acquire</em> by jumping into a <em>giant whirlpool</em>. And there's nothing in particular about anything in the zone that indicates there might be anything down there except a painful watery death.
</li><li> A fair number of boss fights require players to "soak" otherwise avoidable attacks, generally to prevent raid-wide damage. For example, in the fight against Malkorok, after the boss does an Arcing Smash, several swirls will appear, doing damage to any players within them and doing raid-wide damage if they do not have any players within them.
</li><li> In most encounters, it's generally best to dispel debuffs ASAP (unless they trigger an effect of some sort upon expiring). In the fight against the Lich King, however, the best way to deal with the adds was to have the player with Necrotic Plague run over to the Drudge Ghouls, dispel it and have it pass between each of the ghouls, killing them in turn, before passing to the Shambling Horror with enough stacks to kill it. Of course, this largely became unnecessary in future expansions, when players had more than enough DPS to kill the adds.
<ul><li> This was actually done earlier with Hakkar. The main way to damage Hakkar isn't to just attack him - he's much too bulky for your 20-person group. So how do you do it? Kite a mob over, kill it, have everyone stand in the cloud so they get poisoned just when Hakkar decides to start draining blood from you... so he instead drains <em>poison</em>. Yes, you literally kill the boss by making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckOutThePoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckOutThePoison">Suck Out the Poison</a> from you.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Maiden of Vigilance encounter in the Tomb of Sargeras, there is a <em>large</em> hole in the center of the room that will take you to the next encounter once the Maiden is defeated. During the fight, you must intentionally throw yourself into the hole whenever you're afflicted with an ability that will afflict raid-wide damage to nullify it and allow the explosion to launch you back out. If you mis-time the jump, though, you'll blow up the raid or fall to your death.

<ul><li> Almost all roles would try their best to not act suspicious so as to not get lynched in the day. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJester">The Jester</a> however, should try to act as suspicious as possible so that he will be lynched- for getting lynched <em>is</em> his win condition.
</li><li> If your role is a useful one for the town, you might want to deliberately act a <em>little bit</em> suspicious, not enough to actually get lynched, but enough that the Mafia decide they can easily turn the town against you, and so use their night kill on someone else.
</li><li> Ordinary townies with no special power want to do their best to get the Mafia to kill them at night, because this is effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a> for power roles.

<ul><li> The Waluigi Island board in <em>Mario Party 3</em> has a loop area in one of the corners where every space is the same and the effect of that space (Game Guy, Item game, Chance Time etc.) changes every turn. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJwLP4AF_1c&amp;t=781s">As demonstrated by Brainscratch Commentaries<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, with a decent bit of luck it is possible to win by looping constantly around this area and using effects like Bowser, Chance Time and Duels to constantly screw with other players (although it helps if you have the Bonus Stars turned on).
</li><li> As demonstrated by the famous meme involving Luigi, there are several minigames in the <em>Mario Party</em> series that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinsByDoingAbsolutelyNothing">you can win against the computer by doing absolutely nothing</a>.

The nonsensical part is that the sails work like jets, providing drive force no matter what direction they're facing. So when you point the sails face-up like wings so that the drive force pushes you up, you can turn your slow-as-molasses car into a cheap, perpetual flying machine.
</li><li> In the otherwise somewhat-kinda realistic alien shooter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a> III</em>, what's the best way to destroy a giant flying alien ship? Chase it with motorcycles, and then cling to a cruise missile that's heading for the ship! And then leap from missile to missile in the salvo as they impact uselessly on the alien's shield. Considering that you've mostly been running along the ground, climbing walls, and riding tanks so far, it's an unusually... brazen choice of attack.
</li><li> In <em>Cactus McCoy</em> holding a <em>chicken</em> over your head somehow makes you magically capable of performing formerly-impossible jumps. Of course, this happens to be a game where enemies are just as likely to attack you with banjos or tumbleweeds as they are to use something <em>sensible</em> like a pistol or a crowbar, so...
</li><li> The first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> games seemed to like this, especially the original:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996">the first game</a>, the level Temple Ruins has a side-area hidden off-screen with a stack of eighteen boxes that you can only cross by walking across an invisible crate bridge that reveals itself as you walk across it. This is only hinted at by a sole Wumpa Fruit hovering off the edge of a safe platform for seemingly no reason. The follow-up to this level, Jaws of Darkness, does it even worse. It does the exact same trick only this time there's no Wumpa Fruit hint, the bridge is now made of platforms that drop soon after you step on them, and the way back is to cross a <em>second</em> invisible bridge back to the main level!
</li><li> Also in the first game, the level Road to Nowhere can only be fully completed after getting the Red Gem, which appears at the end of the level. Jumping on it simply takes you over the end vortex with a view to nothing. Unless you went backwards at the start of The High Road, there's no reason for you to expect that there are invisible yellow planks you can jump across with that will take you to the last boxes you need.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack">Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</a></em>, some of the Gems require you to fall down what appear to be the usual bottomless pits...<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">with no indication which pits to fall into or that you even should in the first place</a></em>. In Heavy Machinery in the original game, a section with several crates is also accessed this way, with the only clue being a pair of enemies hovering down the pit for no reason.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped">Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped</a></em>, the secret Eggipus Rex level could only be found by letting Crash get caught and carried away by one of the easily-avoided pterodactyl enemies late into the Dino Mite! level. As per usual, there's no reason for you to want to do this.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> games have a lot of this - you often find secret areas by jumping into bottomless pits or other improbable places. However, the games are usually kind enough to hint at which pits are safe to jump into... in the form of barely-visible collectibles just offscreen. Still, some of the secret rooms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> require luck or trial and error to find. For example, in Barrel Cannon Canyon, there's a secret room that you find by deliberately launching yourself out of a barrel at the wrong time, causing you to miss another barrel and slamming you into a wall and revealing the secret area. In the rest of the level, pulling off this move would simply rob you of an extra life. In Stop &amp; Go Station, there's a Kong letter floating over a pit that is seemingly impossible to grab without dying  unless you exploit the ability to do a jump in mid air after performing a roll attack.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em>, you have to jump <em>into</em> a cluster of the same nasty giant Rosaceae-family fruit<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bzwo');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bzwo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bzwo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Apples or cherries, they're of the rose family either way.</span> that have gibbed you repeatedly on previous screens.
</li><li> In the Treasure game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MischiefMakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MischiefMakers">Mischief Makers</a></em>, you fight the wolf-man Lunar twice. The first time is very normal, but for the second one he's riding his transformable cerberus bike. Your solution: ride a cat. This is further improved by the fact that said cat can jump on Lunar's missiles, riding them like flying surfboards. Go Reality! In that game, you're generally encouraged to grab things which are fired at you... bullets, missiles, even huge sustained blasts from laser cannons... and throw them back.
</li><li> Many of the levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/N" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/N">N</a></em> force you to do this to pass a deadly trap by running full-tilt into another, or using a deadly trap as a lift.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic the Hedgehog CD</a></em>, Wacky Workbench contains some large gray blocks in narrow corridors that slowly descend, then quickly slam against the ceiling. These do <em>not</em> crush you, as similar objects in other Sonic games (and later in the same game) do, and are not only completely harmless, but useful: Letting them push against the ceiling will drop you into an area below. It's even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">necessary to use one to reach the Robotizer in Zone 1</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>, pressing forward while running faster than usual (usually after being launched by a spring) will <em>reduce</em> your speed. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em> and Sonic CD fixed this for the most part, but the air speed cap meant that it still occurred on the air. It wasn't until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> that the problem was truly corrected.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> series has quite a few examples of ridiculous things being necessary to grab coins or other goodies, ranging from jumping off the top of a mountain to leaping into a volcano or allowing yourself to sink into quicksand.
<ul><li> One particularly excellent example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiSuperstarSaga">Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga</a></em>. After Luigi obtains the power to create electricity from his hands, you open a warp pipe leading to the bottom of the ocean. In order to proceed, you have to give power to a conductive object. Underwater. The game doesn't seem to have any problem with this. Nor with Mario setting things on fire while underwater.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, what do you have to do to get the last two purple coins in the Freezeflame Galaxy Purple Coin mission? Apparently, you have to do a long jump off the summit of a mountain to some conveniently placed columns a good hundred meters below. Considering the sheer amount of black holes and instant death pits around the rest of the mountain, this is more than a little suspect, even when the Toad at the summit actually encourages you to jump.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, several hidden stars require you to make suicidal leaps of faith. For example, one hidden star in the last stage of World 1 has you jumping into lava, causing Mario to bounce high enough to reach it.
</li><li> In 3D Mario games, the best way to avoid falling damage is to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a>, which makes you fall <em>even faster.</em> It happens because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundPound">Ground Pound</a> pauses your momentum but still.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> takes this a step further - Fall far enough while in Ground Pound stance and Mario will catch fire, similar to a spacecraft undergoing atmosphere re-entry. Some buttons have a flame symbol on them, and are activated by being hit by on-fire Ground Pounding Mario.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> has Mario slowly lose life while underwater for long periods of time, then have it restored to its full level when he surfaces. This causes a rather fun loophole where the best cure to being beaten to a pulp is to dive underwater for about a second, then surface, where Mario will gain all his health back from said beating. (Future games in the series fixed this loophole by adding a separate 'air' meter.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em>, Toad moves faster when carrying enemies, even ones as big as he is. There is also a shortcut in World 6-3 that takes you to the end of the level that you get to by sinking in the quicksand next to the wall at the start of the level.
</li><li> Similarly, there is a bonus area in World 8-2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> that you get to by sinking all the way in a quicksand pit. Not only that, if you bypass said bonus area, the Angry Sun from World 2 will start attacking you midway through the level, despite all of World 8 taking place in the dark.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, it's possible to beat Big Boos (towering ghosts that are at least 5 times bigger than Mario and normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion">immune</a> to most things he can do) by making Mario slide down a set of stairs into them (never mind the physical impossibility of sliding down steps).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> frequently rewards risky or out-of-the-box exploration. There's a sinkhole in the quicksand, which has been instant death in several previous games? Well, that's actually the entrance to a hidden level. A conveyor of moving pillars blocking your Bullet Bill's flight across a chasm? Don't be so hasty to go through them—try riding the conveyor into the wall.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Unfair Mario</em>, the Mario fangame, has one level where you are being chased by a ghost and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you have to get killed by the ghost to progress</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLand">Wario</a> makes Guybrush look sane in his absolutely hilarious violations of common sense. These range from setting himself on fire to destroy obstacles in his path, getting crushed to the point of being flattened to go through tiny spaces, being stung by bees to float to higher places... Though it helps in two of the games that Wario is invincible throughout both games.
</li><li> A good number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> bosses have their weakness be the weapon that makes the <em>least</em> sense to use against them. Some are fairly intuitive (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">water or ice-based weapons tend to be effective against fire-based bosses</a>), or have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">obvious tactical appeal</a> (such as using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartBomb">screen-nuke</a> on an agile or shield-using opponent, or a slow-moving bomb on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>) or are just gags to make weak weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a> (using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">hideously lame Bubble Lead or Top Spin</a> to take down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>). But then you have the constantly ramming Dive Man, who is weak to a weapon that requires you to try and ram him yourself, or the near-always-airborne Tengu Man and Star Man, who are weak to weapons that can only hit enemies on the ground, or Wave Man, who is weak to a sliding charge weapon while he constantly spits out walls and projectiles to block your slide.

As <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/MadamLuna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/MadamLuna">Madam Luna</a> pointed out, this is a game that doesn't so much encourage you to think outside the box as encourage you to do the exact opposite of what it tells you to do. The very first level involves turning around and going the opposite direction that the arrows on the floor are pointing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> traditionally awards a substantial amount of points on a Tetris and levels you up every 10 lines, and additionally making Tetrises gives you substantially more points per line than lesser line clears, so the obvious strategy is to make tons of Tetrises, or at least multi-line clears. However, some <em>Tetris</em> games in Marathon mode, particularly <em>Tetris Friends</em> and <em>Tetris Splash</em>, most likely by poor design, flip this entire concept on its head. Marathon mode uses a "goal" system where instead of a level up every 10 lines, you gain "Goal" points by clearing lines, leveling up when you drain the remaining Goal point counter to 0, with the proportion of Goal points to lines cleared increasing the more lines you clear at once (a Single is worth 1 Goal point, while a Tetris is worth <em>eight</em>), and additionally the game offers bonuses for consecutive pieces that clear out lines. This results in an environment where the best way to score is to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">combos of single-line clears</a> most of the time, because if you make Tetrises regularly, that will actually <em>hurt your score</em>. Later games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuyoPuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuyoPuyo">Puyo Puyo</a> Tetris</em> did away with this, instead just requiring you to clear 150 lines.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scribblenauts">Scribblenauts</a></em>, some of the valid level solutions fall into this territory. Most notably, it's possible to finish a level <em>while dying</em> if you know where the Starite will appear upon completion and manage to stand in that exact spot (so that you automatically grab it before you lose due to being dead), and so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie">summoning things which will kill you</a> such as nuclear bombs, black holes, and meteors can actually be a functional way of completing certain levels.

It was required to send waves upon waves of your lower level units repeatedly to their deaths. Ironically, this was especially necessary for Gondor, which relied heavily on its high level units, and less so for the forces of evil, which functioned on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a> basis. Some missions had secondary tasks that involved giving several of your units a certain upgrade. The problem stems if you happen to be <em>far</em> too successful in keeping your units alive and carry them over from the previous mission. If they all happen to already have that upgrade, and you can't train any more units due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit">Arbitrary Headcount Limit</a>, then you have to send your experienced, upgraded units to die just to complete that secondary task.
</li><li> Penal battalions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em> are supposed to be expendable meatshield, yet their stats and costs are way higher than the conscripts that they are supposed to die for. So logically, the smart choice would be to use conscripts as meatshield and use Penals as your main infantry instead. In Soviet Russia, you are fodders for cowards and war criminals.
</li><li> Denying, the killing of your own troops to reduce the gold and experience available to your enemies, is a vital gameplay element in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DefenseOfTheAncients">Defense of the Ancients: All-Stars</a></em>.

<ul><li> Karthus' passive ability causes him to enter a state upon dying for seven seconds where he is untargetable, his (wide) Area of Effect ability is constantly on and all his other spells can be cast with no mana cost or cast times. Sometimes running straight into a crowd of enemies and dying is the best way for Karthus to contribute to a teamfight.
</li><li> This is also the recommended strategy for Singed. A common rule of thumb for playing him is: Would you think doing X is a good idea if you were playing anyone else? If so, quit it. If not, you're good to go. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration">But how else would you expect someone called the "Mad Chemist" to play</a>?
</li><li> Graves plays completely different than a normal marksman, including an ability that forces you <em>closer</em> to enemies when most ranged champions want to stay away.

</li><li> The 10th Anniversary achievements often fall into this category, with some of them requiring the player to complete the mission while not doing certain things that would make it easier, such as not building the unit that is introduced in the mission (and will often be the absolute best unit in it), <em>only</em> building <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Worker Units</a> and the new unit type (if that unit cannot attack air units), not building any anti-air units, and not using a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, among others.

Of course, you can't hit notes with that button while you're holding it down, so if the same button is needed before reaching the maximum hold score, you'll have to choose between keeping the hold and breaking your combo, or dropping the hold to hit the note. Surprisingly, the best choice may sometimes be to let your combo break and keep the hold, as the bonus points from maxing out the hold may be worth more than the notes you'll miss. This means that getting the highest possible score on a song is mutually exclusive with getting a perfect combo.

If an ally or enemy has Reflect cast on them, any magic will bounce off them and attack the opponents instead.

Sounds like he'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalAbsorption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalAbsorption">be healed by fire attacks</a>, right? Well, they do... but since he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsFightLikeGentlemen">believes in a fair fight</a>, he'll turn around and heal you if you cast even the weakest Fire spell on him. Common sense goes right out the window, however, when he puts his Cloak of Flame up - because rather than give him immunity to ice in addition to absorbing fire, it flips his elemental affinities, and the Fiend of Fire somehow becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">weak</a> to his own element.
</li><li> In yet another, even more blatant schmuck bait example, if you give in to attacking the Tricker goblin with lightning, what with it constantly telling you how it's weak against lightning, it will then respond by casting Haste on itself, and then repeatedly fry your party with Lit3 over and over and over until either you or it is dead.

<ul><li> At the D-District Prison, when Squall is being tortured for information he does not actually have, the player is given the choice between "I'll lie... I must live..." and "Just let me die...". Choosing the latter causes some friendly monsters to help you out later on, while you get nothing for lying.
</li><li> The chances of being able to perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, as well as the strength of these Limit Breaks, is dependent on how much danger your characters are in. The more danger, the better. Clever players will realize this and invoke the hidden power of Squall and Co. by having them be beaten to within an inch of their life; as long as they never stop to heal their life-threatening wounds, they can easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">use these god-tier attacks once per turn</a>. Even casting the Aura spell, which allows players to use Limit Breaks just as frequently without being put in mortal peril, is not enough to dissuade this tactic. In fact, characters with Aura <em>and</em> low health will be able to unleash their most powerful Limit Break variations every time. Goodbye difficulty, goodbye common sense!
</li><li> An optional example comes in the way the game is programmed, all enemies levels are directly dependent on the partys levels. In other words, the higher your level, the tougher the enemies are. Thus, the game gets easier if the player sets Quetzalcoatl to learn Card as its first ability, doesnt kill any enemies except bosses (which yield 0XP but a large number of AP), And once Quetzalcoatl has learned Card, simply turn every enemy that isnt a boss into a card. This way, since the enemy wasnt slain, no XP is awarded, but since it was defeated, AP is still awarded. The cards can then be refined into magic, which is equipped like armor and weapons. FFVIII is literally the only FF game where leveling up the old-fashioned way actually makes the game harder.

</li><li> Dodging lightning strikes on the Thunder Plains. At first, it seems like it's just a way to avoid being annoyingly inconvenienced from being knocked back while traveling through there. In reality, the game expects you to dodge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">200 consecutive lightning strikes in a row</a> in order to fully unlock Lulu's Ultimate Weapon.
</li><li> A certain boss fight, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yunalesca</span>, uses an attack called Hellbiter, which damages the whole party and inflicts Zombie status. Zombie status causes healing items and spells to damage the victim instead, making it difficult to heal. Since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yunalesca</span> is a difficult boss with some fairly damaging attacks, this makes things a lot harder, so a player's instinct would be to cure Zombie status straight away, right? Except in the boss's third form, they use an attack called Mega Death, which instantly KOs everyone in the party 100% of the time. Deathproof armor will protect you, but you're not very likely to have any. However, it doesn't work on anyone with the Zombie status, which means the best option is actually <em>not</em> to cure it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are certain bosses and hunt marks with obvious long wind-ups to extremely powerful attacks. Seems like the obvious answer then, is to activate a defensive paradigm so your party can defend and heal up. Right? Sure, in some cases, and it is indeed a safer bet. However, if you want a 5-Star rating from the battle, and thus better chances of getting better quality items, this is instead the point in which you throw caution to the wind, and go all out, filling the Stagger gauge to full and increasing the bonus damage to maximum. In a few of these cases, this also stuns the enemy, stopping their attack.
</li><li> A specific example of this trope in XIII is the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> first fight with Barthandelus</span> when he uses his strongest attack, Destrudo which can easily KO characters, a player will likely instinctively switch to a defensive paradigm to mitigate the damage, however if you quickly raise his stagger gauge enough by using an offensive paradigm first, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Barthandelus</span> will clearly groan and Destrudo will inflict much less damage. It doesn't just easily kill characters, it WILL kill a maxed out party of three sentinels (read: Tanks), all using protect with any defense buffs and the best possible equipment, because that's just what it does.

Unfortunately, the original characters in the myths were <em>gods</em>- much stronger than any human- so you must regularly order heroquesters to perform feats that are impossible <em>for them</em>. Retelling the myth accurately gives you much higher chances of success than just 'playing it safe'- especially since the spirit realm basically runs on dream logic.

However, doing exactly that is the best way to fight him short of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Flu Season exploit</a>, since if you can survive its first attack (Enduring Soul helps), it only gets one attack per turn as opposed to its usual two, removing a significant amount of the difficulty from the (still challenging) fight.

<ul><li> Type match-ups usually make sense, at least when you really think about it, but one stands out in particular as initially bizarre. What's your best choice of Pokemon to send out against the gigantic, beastly, kaiju-esque Dragon-Types? Why, a harmless-looking, adorable Fairy like Clefable or Azumarill, of course!
</li><li> Similarly, size is completely irrelevant. What is the best choice to fight a hundred-foot long flying water dragon (Gyarados) who could swallow a human whole? How about a 10lb yellow mouse? In game, electricity has double-type-advantage for a 4x damage bonus. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DetectivePikachu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DetectivePikachu">Detective Pikachu</a></em> showed just how lopsided this fight would be in real life.
</li><li> This was much of the reason for the Physical/Special split in the fourth generation. Moves were classified by their typing rather than on an individual basis, with the intention being that physical moves used the Pokemon's pure strength, but special moves were based on energy attacks. This led to, for instance, it being a bad idea to teach Fire Punch to rough-and-tumble boxer Hitmonchan, when the frail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> Alakazam could make much better use of it, or an abnormally large number of powerful physical attackers deciding to instead learn to shoot Hyper Beams. The strangest case, though, was the Dark and Ghost types, where the former had lots of physically-oriented types learning moves like Bite and Feint Attack, and the latter had specially-oriented types learning moves like Shadow Ball and Night Shade. Yet Dark was considered special, and Ghost was considered physical.
</li><li> For most games in the series, wild Pokemon appear as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> in long grass as you walk through. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em> is the first game in the main series, however, where wild Pokemon are visible in the overworld, potentially allowing you to choose the encounters you want. If you run through grass the wild Pokemon will chase you, while sneaking (walking slowly enough - the animation changes to let you know) prevents them from doing so. Pokemon near the edge may also chase you even if you just run past the bush without going into it. Since sneaking can only be done in tall grass, this means that diverting through the long grass is likely the most effective way to <em>avoid</em> wild Pokemon in this game.

<ul><li> The fight with Toriel: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You have to keep hitting Spare until she takes pity on you and gives up; this will invariably whittle you down to your last HP, at which point her attacks deliberately evade <em>you</em> even if you try to steer into them.

The only hint that you can and must spare her without fighting or acting comes from an optional conversation with an NPC that is easy to miss, and a message that results from acting if you have previously killed her and then reloaded</span>.

The basics involve marking certain areas for housing (which causes immigrants to appear and settle automatically) and providing amenities such as food, pottery, entertainment and so on to increase the happiness of your population. Most levels have objectives to build a sufficiently impressive monument or pyramid and to stockpile/trade certain resources along with targets for either population or happiness. If the game gives you a target for population but not happiness then once the other objectives are complete you can simply create massive, infrastructure-free slums that contribute nothing to your city but that automatically fill up with bodies to push you over the population limit. The inhabitants will be living wretched, pointless lives but at least they push your numbers up. The flip side is when the game asks for a high average happiness level. You could provide much-needed infrastructure to help your population... or you could start demolishing, starting from the poorest houses and working your way up, effectively kicking the sad people out of your city and therefore raising the average level of satisfaction.
</li><li> In the original PC and SNES versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a></em>, rails behave exactly as roads except they produce no pollution and handle more traffic. You can achieve higher populations by omitting roads entirely and using rails in their place. Later games in the series fixed this by adding other forms of transportation (buses, subways, highways, etc.) and requiring trips over rail to start and end at train stations as you'd expect.

It's possible, though difficult, to do this and successfully escape, and the debriefing indicates that Command did receive <em>some kind</em> of useful information from the stunt, but it's never really explained in a way that would justify it.

However, to emphasize penalties, the clock winds slower when a team is on the power play. So, for a team that is losing in the final minutes, it is to their advantage to have a less offensively-inclined player commit an intentional foul. This not only gives you more time to even the score but it allows the shorthanded team to leave a cherry picking forward up ice without fear of accidentally icing the puck.

</li><li> In the second game in the series your 'health' does not regenerate. The sane solution is to go out of your way to find a doctor and pay him to patch you up. However, if your character dies at any point then you will respawn in more or less the same place with full health and suffer no penalties whatsoever. Therefore the quickest and cheapest method of getting your health back is to get yourself killed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag">Black Flag</a></em>, you have the option of battling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">legendary ships,</a> which are ships that spawn in each corner of the world and are much tougher than the other ships you can battle. One of these fights, in the northeast corner, pits you up against two ships, so naturally, on their own they are much easier. Well, if you kill one, you get 10,000 Reales. If you die, you just start the fight over... with all that money. Which means the best method to grind for money and supplies is to get yourself killed by the same ship over and over.

It seemed reasonable to assume that shooting him would spill blood on said uniform and render it useless as a disguise, plus one still had a garrote in the inventory. It seemed that it was best to attempt to sneak up on the guard and kill him without spilling blood, but he would always discover the player character and disable him with a taser. Turned out, you were just supposed to shoot him, and wear the mysteriously spotless uniform as a disguise.

It's no surprise that one method of eliminating him is to prove him wrong about that. In fairness, the prototype android works <em>perfectly</em> at firing on scanned photo inputs should 47 not intervene in the demonstration. The only reason it attacks Robert Knox is because he's a relatively famous man, and 47 has been walking around collecting celebrity magazine covers
</li><li> Hiding obviously lethal items in a Briefcase is this, as it has the same rules as the frisks you're given. Hiding firearms such as the Custom 9mm gun or the poison syringes in the briefcase? Guards don't bat an eyelid at it. You Dare to hide a <em><strong>Letter Opener</strong></em> in your briefcase and the game won't let you get frisked.
</li><li> The mission "Patient Zero" in the Hitman 2 GOTY Legacy Pack has a specific rules quirk that allows for the player to murder their way through the levels infected, and so long as the infected don't report your murder spree to a guard, then you still qualify for the <em>Silent Assassin</em> rating; the <em>highest rating the game has!</em>. This is because Hitman 2 changed the way Silent Assassin works between releases; Targets don't make you lose Silent Assassin if they see you kill them, which isn't abusable in other missions as only a maximum of 4 targets are possible, but in "Patient Zero", <strong>everyone</strong> can become a Target due to the Virus being contageous.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em>. You are a martial arts expert. How do you avoid being choked to death by a wrinkled old doctor? If you guessed "getting out your Remote-Controlled Missiles and shooting them around yourself so that they hit the person choking you" or "Step on a mine because that scientist on your back is a wuss", or "throw gas grenades upwind so that they blow back into your face" you've just won the boss fight. Congratulations, you're as completely insane as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a>.
</li><li> There's a surprising amount of it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em>, most famously eating Russian Glowcaps to recharge your batteries. This is even considered ridiculous in-game; Para-Medic and Sigint lampshade how that can't be possible.
<ul><li> If Snake is on fire, equipping a <em>cardboard</em> box will put the flames out. Seriously. The cardboard box also makes Snake immune to fire on the ground, which makes most of the fight against The Fury a joke. It can't stand up to a direct hit from The Fury's flamethrower, though; the force of the blast knocks the box off of Snake.
</li><li> Deliberately drowning Snake to escape The Sorrow faster.
</li><li> The most dangerous weapon to use against The Boss isn't a gun; it's the non-lethal Cig Spray. You remember, that thing you picked up at Graniny Gorki hours ago and never bothered using? It works with Snake's CQC combo, and The Boss can't disarm you. It can hit The Boss while she's on the ground, and can even hit her out of her shooting and walking animations. This can be used to exploit the game's programming, too. The Boss won't shoot when she's within CQC range. As long as you stay close and know how to consistently counter her grabs, she'll be finished in about two minutes. This turns one of the best and most dramatic fights in the entire series into little more than a high-stakes game of tag.
</li><li> The Torch, of all things, works almost as well on The Boss as the Cig Spray. Apparently she can't see a huge, fiery stick despite it being a dead giveaway to Snake's position. It has a longer reach than the Cig Spray and can hit her out of animations, but its combo does less damage and can't touch The Boss while she's grounded. She can also disarm you, which is the biggest problem. However, it's surprisingly easy to beat The Boss - non-lethally - with a stick.
</li></ul></li><li> There is a level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter2">Syphon Filter 2</a></em> where a drugged Lian has to escape from a hospital, with all her equipment having been stolen. The main objective is to reach an escape chopper whilst the secondary objective is to find a silenced weapon to aid your escape. It is actually possible to reach the extraction point without first recovering the weapon, whereupon the game will show the helicopter whisking the player off to safety... followed by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> screen because you failed the objective to collect a weapon that you no longer need!
<ul><li> A level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> requires you to solve a rather tricky dilemma. An assassin is going after an important person, but you need both alive in order to complete the mission. You obviously can't let the assassin shoot the hostage, but killing the assassin will fail the mission. The solution? You have to shoot the assassin with your taser, but only for a very brief moment. The problem—and where it invokes this trope—is that the taser before this point has been exclusively used as a lethal weapon, with no effect if you use it for the brief amount of time that the game requires. This isn't helped by the fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">that there are no hints that this is what the game wants you to do</a>.

There's also one enemy called a "Scout" who moves around and periodically releases its tentacles around it and if it touches the player, it will summon a bunch of enemies towards the player. So what's the best way to kill the Scout without waking up the sleepers? Why, use a Mine Detector; plant a mine towards the path of the Scout, wait for the Scout to walk by it and it dies when the mine's tripped. This <em>doesn't</em> wake up any sleepers despite the fact that there's a really loud explosion in the area.

Normally, fighting a recruitable enemy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">the exact opposite of what you want to do</a>, so this comes across as a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of the first game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemShadowDragonAndTheBladeOfLight">Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light</a>,</em> simply called <em>Shadow Dragon</em> in the west, all but one of the secret missions are blocked to you if you have too many units in your standing army, forcing you to get some of them killed in order to access them. The last one requires you to do yet more self-destructive acts like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> losing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Falchion</a> and getting Tiki killed</span>. However, previous games in the series emphasized <em>protecting</em> your units from death at all costs, so most players wouldn't want to let so many characters die. Not only that, the requirements for how many units is "too many" remains consistently at "more than 15" for <em>all</em> secret chapters but the last; in a game with over 50 unique characters <em>and</em> technically-infinite "replacement" characters, even players who were OK with losing units would probably never see the secret chapters without intentionally killing almost every unit in the game (including, most likely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">the very units you could recruit in the secret missions</a>).
</li><li> One story example that's lampshaded in-game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>: One side chapter also gives you the choice of allying with one mercenary group to fight another and quickly resolve a dispute, but you get the most reward out of choosing to fight against both of them, despite the fact that they not only severely outnumber you, but they also start off with a terrain advantage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Chrom</a> is understandably concerned if you choose this course of action.

With one exception - toxic worlds. Apparently, clearing a world of toxins is infinitely more difficult than building a planet out of asteroid chunks like a giant jigsaw puzzle. So, some savvy players have figured out that, if you want to capture an alien colony but don't want to have a toxic un-upgradable planet, just blow it up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Stellar Converter</a>, colonize a planet in the same system, and rebuild the destroyed planet as a barren world. Easy, right?
<ul><li> The best part is that no matter the original size of the planet (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, or Huge), the one reconstructed from the resulting asteroid belt will always be Large.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> games, there are pilots who can pilot repair units to help gain levels. And then there are units who are equipped with MAP weapons, which target the field rather than just one unit. Normally, players would never fire MAP weapons near friendly allies as this will injure them and/or kill these units. However, intersect the two and the repair units will be able to gain a lot of levels just by hitting themselves with a MAP attack over and over again. This is slightly nerfed in <em>Third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z</a> Heaven's Chapter</em> where the MAP attack will not show up unless there's an enemy in range of the MAP attack.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series, you hang on to items long after they've seemingly lost their usefulness, only to have them turn out to be useful evidence later. For some items it's just minorly odd, for items like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Trucy and Little Plum's panties</span> it seems outright bizarre that you wouldn't give them back immediately.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveANiceDeath">Tiger Dojos</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, actually <em>encourage</em> the player to act like this. Frequently after you get a Bad End, they advise you to go back and choose the more reckless, immature option.
<ul><li> Except when they don't, which can make a player that has received a bunch of "take risks and go for it!" try to do that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> such as attacking the shrine</span> and they get punished and die for it, then try to play it safe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> like not venturing into the basement of the church</span> and get punished and die for it, rather irritated because it seems like the game can't make up its mind if it wants you to play cautious or reckless. Incidentally, this too is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the Tiger Dojo segments, with it being explicitly said that you can be punished for <em>both</em> playing on the offensive or defensive, depending on the situation.

After landing hard, Kotomine asks why in the hell Shirou would to that when he doesn't have the magic enhancements Kotomine does, and Shirou rather lamely says he just didn't want to look bad. Everyone present stares at him like he's a total idiot.

Trying to run away at the first possible opportunity not only does not lead to any negative consequences, it earns Chizuru affection points with Hijikata, who admires that kind of defiant conviction.

The mentally healthy thing to do is to take a walk, expose Yuuya to some new scenery, right? <strong>No.</strong> If he does that, he'll die through a logical but complicated series of events. If he goes to sleep, he will get kidnapped...but he won't die, and he'll hear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">the exposition</a> needed to progress the plot.
<ul><li> From a certain perspective, however, that decision makes sense. It's never a good idea to go walking at night- even in populated areas, as Yuuya did- and getting sleep is psychologically important too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Nameless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Nameless">Nameless</a></em> has one last CG and extra route to unlock, after completing the five regular and one Secret route. In order to unlock it, the player needs to delete their save file, which also has the effect of forgetting the titular character's actual name, which was the whole point of playing through those routes.

Generally speaking, betraying characters who trust you tends to lead to bad endings, but there are a few times where you have to betray the other person to continue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The biggest example is when you play the game with your closest ally Phi. You have to betray your her in one timeline to make the other timeline where she betrays <em>you</em> make sense. The narration even states that you have no idea why you did it, though if you did the other path where you allied with her and she betrayed you first, then your character is confused about why she chose ally in this timeline when you picked betray since the other timeline was the exact opposite.</span>

Dataminers found that the game stops awarding points for trees if you past 190 trees and actually starts deducting points at more than 220 trees. For a game called <em>Animal Forest</em> in its home market of Japan... What?
<ul><li> Even weirder is that shrubs count as trees. So someone who makes elaborate shrub displays can wind up getting the same penalty.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em>, jumping up/down stairs is actually a quicker and more efficient way to navigate stairs compared to just walking up and down them. In real life, you'll either just tire yourself out faster (going up), and potentially sprain/fracture/break something (going down).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Glean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Glean">Glean</a></em>: You collect Small Lava Globules by touching lava droplets dripping from lava pools, damaging your ship in the process. What's even better is that you use them to upgrade your ship's cooling systems, which is necessary to drill deeper.

<ul><li> If you're falling from a great height, you don't need your parachute! Simply fire your hookshot at the ground, and it will pull you down to safety, even though all it should do is make you hit the ground faster. In fact, it's <em>better</em> than the parachute, since you're easier to shoot when you're slowly drifting through the air.
</li><li> In order to progress through a tutorial in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2">the second game</a>, you have to take a ride with a guy to get to your destination. Oh no! The police are here! Do you think Rico Rodriguez would jump into the passenger seat and shoot from there? Hell no; he <em>hops onto the car's roof</em> and begins shooting, disregarding such minor things as inertia, and <em>making himself a larger target</em>.
</li><li> When trying to land an airplane, you're likely to end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">roasted to death in a flaming fuselage</a> due to an error in judgement or just outright impatience. The <em>safest</em>, and fastest, way to exit a plane is to leap out of it in midair and parachute or grapple to the ground - even if the plane is only a few meters up and moving horizontally at top speed (again, ignoring inertia). Plus, it makes for an epic view watching the explosion on the way down.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, you have to punch trees with your bare hands in order to get the tools you need to survive. <em>That's just the start.</em>

<ul><li> Remember that lava that you just collected? You can redirect its flow using <em>wooden</em> signs and ladders, with no repercussions. The hilarious part? Lava causes trees, wooden planks/stairs/slabs, and wood doors to <em>burn</em>.
</li><li> Lava can also be safely contained by blocks of glass or sand. Heating sand in a furnace melts it into glass, and you can do this <em>using a bucket of lava</em>, but for some reason sand can sit right next to lava without melting. If that's not confusing enough for you, try throwing sand or glass (or anything else) into lava—this will <em>vaporize</em> it. The inventory has no direct means of deleting items, so it's common practice to dispose of unwanted items by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">tossing them into lava</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> You can make an infinite source of water. The requirements being a <em>measly</em> two buckets of the stuff.

Throwing a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem">snowball</a> at one will destroy it.

This is actually a common strategy because snowballs are much easier to stockpile than arrows, and can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">thrown in quick succession</a>.

<ul><li> Beginning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">chess</a> players are taught several basic principles (control the center of the board, don't exchange stronger pieces for weaker ones, don't expose your king in the opening or middlegame, etc.). However, principles like these are only correct most of the time, and master players are known to sometimes make moves that look insane to beginners but are actually brilliant. One notable example was in the Candidates Match between Bobby Fischer and Tigran Petrosian in 1971, where the former exchanged his extremely well-placed knight for the latter's bishop, which wasn't doing anything useful at the time. Many grandmasters observing the game were confused, until it soon became apparent that the exchange allowed Fischer's rooks to get a huge amount of activity, which was enough to win the game for him.

For a while, one of the choices could potentially be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Whammy">Whammy</a>, and while it seems like no player in their right mind would ever willingly pick it (and indeed, no one ever did), astute viewers have pointed out that doing so could actually be a viable strategy to transfer a large number of passed spins (which the player was obligated to take) to the Earned column, assuming the player in question had a negligible score to lose and had hit no more than one Whammy prior to that point.

<ul><li> The "Special" is a major award found on most pinball machines made available either by being very skilled or very lucky, and most often, they are located in an outlane, which leads to the drain. That is, you have to lose a ball to earn the Special. (The Special is a free game by default, but the operator can change it in the settings to award an extra ball<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2qge6');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2qge6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2qge6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">typically used when a machine is set to Free Play, in which case a free game is meaningless</span>, a fixed points value<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3qr94');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3qr94" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3qr94');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">typically used in tournaments, where extra balls are disabled</span>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zonk">absolutely nothing</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note42zgr');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note42zgr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note42zgr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">typically reserved for operators who are just feeling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">dickish</a></span>.)
</li><li> Gobble holes are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">holes that consume your ball</a>, ending it instantly, but are not located at the bottom like the drain. Rather, you're supposed to deliberately bring the ball there, as they are always worth a very large points award that easily dwarfs anything else on the table, and sometimes with extra balls or free games on top of that. They were common during an era when games were short and unpredictable, so the gobble hole was a low-risk guaranteed award.
</li><li> Nudging the machine isn't just a way to gain an advantage, it's a <em>tournament-standard technique</em>. Yet to non-players, rocking the table looks completely unnecessary and violent, especially if you tried to nudge a redemption machine, for example, you'd probably set off alarms and get kicked out of the arcade; on a pinball table, as long as you aren't straight up lifting the machine or otherwise being extremely brutal, the worst that happens is that the game quietly disables the playfield and voids your current ball.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Avatar">Avatar</a>,</em> the "Final Battle" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardMode">Wizard Mode</a> requires the player to hit enough targets on the playfield, then shoot the Unobtanium target for the Jackpot. If the player chooses instead to let the ball drain down an outlane with a lit Unobtanium light, the Jackpot is increased and the ball is automatically returned to play.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillShot">Skill Shot</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Congo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Congo">Congo</a></em> has you launch the ball into play so it lands...in the outlane drain on the other side. Doing so gets you an instant 25 million points. Granted, there is a big arrow-shaped light pointing towards it when you begin, but it isn't clear if you've never seen the game before that there's a solenoid that will shove the ball back out again.
</li><li> The objective of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Whirlwind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Whirlwind">Whirlwind</a></em> is to <em>guide</em> a tornado to your area. No explanation is given as to why this is a good idea.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder30');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder30" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The orca is the only whale on earth that <em>deliberately</em> beaches itself, and it does so to hunt seals.
</li><li> A lot of knowledge humanity has accumulated is due to people violating common sense. Look, someone's eating those plants/animals that don't look appetizing. Did they die or live? Either way, we've learned something that acting in a "safe or sensible fashion" wasn't teaching us.
</li><li> Humankind has been quoted as having this trope as its actual main forte. Take a look at early beyond-the-horizon maritime exploration. "Hey, look at all this expanse of water that goes farther than the eye can reach. Yes, the one that all who have tried to cross have never returned. Let's build a ship and try to cross it!".
</li><li> Certain medical treatments can come across as this, since a few use harmful substances in small amounts, or seem to cause injury to a person in order to heal. Certain heart conditions, for instance, can be treated efficiently with carefully managed amounts of the compound nitroglycerin, most famously used as a powerful explosive. Cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy, which is essentially a (hopefully) non-lethal dose of poison. Leeches can be used as a therapeutic treatment to help a person heal after skin grafts, reconstructive surgery, treat varicose veins and other conditions. Maggots are sometimes used to treat gangrene. One that most people are familiar with is defibrillation, a treatment which involves using powerful electrical currents to treat ventricular fibrillation by delivering a "countershock" to the heart. This doesn't fix the fibrillation. It actually causes the heart to stop completely so that it can restart on its own without the irregular beat.
</li><li> In the 1932 <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War">the Australian military went to war against the emus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that were ravaging the western farmlands, then, due to a series of issues with the guns used, blunders by the men sent in and the birds' ability to just get shot and keep running like nothing happened, the army gave up; in other words, the birds won.
</li><li> When in a fist fight it is actually a good idea to move <em>closer</em> to your opponent when dodging a punch. While this is counterintuitive it makes sense because if they actually manage to hit you they won't have extended their arm as far and thus the punch wont have as much force as it would if their arm were fully extended.
</li><li> Survival skills can be this on occasion, because human instinct tends to react to the threat that's visible in the moment, which is often only part of the overall threat picture.
<ul><li> One famous example is the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaprun_disaster">Karpun ski tram fire<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Since the fire was at the rear of the upward-bound train, most of the escaping passengers chose to flee upwards, away from the fire, rather than going downwards which would have required them to pass the burning section of the carriage; however, one small group of escapees included a volunteer firefighter, who instructed the others to do the counter-intuitive thing and go down, even though it meant passing the fire. This was exactly the right call; what the firefighter knew through training was that the greatest danger came not from the visible flames, but from the smoke and toxic fumes, and those gases are lighter than air and will rise. All of the people who fled upwards died of asphyxiation, while the few who went down stayed below the smoke and survived.
<ul><li> Similarly, rangers who deal with wildfires tell you that if there is a hill on fire, you want to go <em>down</em> the hill - even (or really <em>especially</em>) if that's where a fire is - fire <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/plan-prepare/how-fire-behaves">spreads quicker uphill.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> As mentioned in an episode of <em>Seconds from Disaster</em>, if there are potentially lava or pyroclastic flows, you'll actually want to go <em>up</em>hill.
</li><li> If you're caught in a riptide, don't fight it - try to swim parallel to the shore.
</li></ul></li><li> What's one way to deal with a wildfire? Initiate a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn">controlled burn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to starve the wildfire of materials to burn through.
