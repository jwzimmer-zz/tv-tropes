Now that Kit has gained the necessary respect at school by joining a gang who sneaks out of the gates to smoke weed in the local park at lunchtime, he bitterly resents the fact that at home he is still considered just one of the children."</em>

</p><p>That's essentially the definition of Middle Child Syndrome, in which a child automatically may become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> or the rebellious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a>, specifically because they are the easiest child to overlook. They're not old enough to be given the responsibilities and privileges of the oldest, and the youngest child took their spot as the spoiled and doted-on "baby" of the family. This tends to be more of an issue when there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">three children</a> rather than four or more. Oftentimes in media, the middle child ends up becoming more of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> or the quirky one for this reason. That, or they end up the best-adjusted between the overly-responsible elder sibling and overly-privileged younger.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SuperGals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SuperGals">Super Gals</a></em>: Inverted with Ran; out of her siblings, she seems to have the most interactions with her parents (especially her father). However, this has less to do with her being a middle child, and more because of her rebellious tendencies.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>. Belldandy hardly suffers from being a black sheep or unloved, but she does seem to be somewhat left out, as her nature, elegant and refined, is very different from that of Urd and Skuld, who have much more in common with each other than with her. As a result, she's always on the outside of their antics, so much so that she feels jealous.
</li><li> Subverted with Kankuro of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. While, overall, not as powerful as his older sister or younger brother, he's still formidable. It's also implied that <em>none</em> of them really got on well with their father, and Kankuro seems pleased with the opportunity to finally act like a big brother to Gaara after Gaara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. He and Temari are likewise shown to be close. <em>However</em> he is all-but ignored by a lot of the fanbase.
</li><li> Kozue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Working" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Working">WORKING!!</a></em> suffers from this, being the third child of the five Takanashi siblings. This is compounded by the fact that her younger brother Souta is the only son of the family and thus receives a disproportionate amount of attention such that she is often forgotten. As a result, she grew up to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Hard-Drinking Party Girl</a> who simply wanted more attention.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inverted with Killua, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Deuteragonist</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>. He is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">White Sheep</a>, but he's the favorite of his psychotic mother Kikyo, and his father Silva is sure that Killua will become like himself. Killua is also beloved by three of his four brothers. Illumi is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplarBigBrother">an overprotective and extreme</a> older brother, Kalluto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">joins the Phantom Troupe</span> in the hope of bringing his brother home, and Alluka can't <em>not</em> love Killua, the only one of the family who loves Alluka. Even Milluki admits that Killua has the most potential in the family.
</li><li> Considering that the Chimera Ant Royal Guards are siblings, Shaiapouf is the weakest of the three and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">Crazy Jealous Guy</a>. The latter part is the reason why he is so hated by the fandom because he's the only one who acts against the king: trying to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill Komugi</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Jagi, the third of the four Hokuto Shinken brothers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a>, the weakest brother and is the only one never shown in a sympathetic light in the original manga/anime. Raoh is the strongest, Toki is the most talented, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">Kenshiro is the true successor and better than all of them</a>. He's often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> in other media and even in the main series is never mentioned again after his death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe">Minami-ke</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kana Minami is the dumb and lazy sister among the three, is usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> towards her younger sister, but also occasionally to her older sister, too. While Haruka is very popular in her school and Chiaki is respected by her classmates, Kana is not, though, she's not unpopular either and is even the first one to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, to whom she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">oblivious</a>
</li><li> Whenever the three brothers of the other Minami family have a discussion (mostly about their younger sister Touma), Akira Minami is often ignored by his two older brothers due to the age gap, despite that most of his statements are actually right. Not only that, he gets the short stick in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron">Love Dodecahedron</a> between Kana, Fujioka, Riko, and himself.

The eldest broth Masashi, on the other hand, is a serious man who seems to still follow the village's customs faithfully, while the youngest one Tsunemasa is more candid and optimistic - and said by Nobuteru to have been their mother's favorite, although he objects to that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheQuintessentialQuintuplets">The Quintessential Quintuplets</a></em>: Miku Nakano is (initially) the most shy and withdrawn of the quintuplets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Bronze Saints are our five protagonists who keep winning battle against people much stronger than them, and the Gold Saints are said much stronger people, who are greatly respected, extremely dangerous, and are focused on just as much as the Bronzes. But... what about the Silver Saints...? They are pretty much just there to either be the Bronzes' mentors, or the obnoxious one-off enemies. Aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Marin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Shaina</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFightingNarcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFightingNarcissist">Misty</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Lyra Orphee</a>, nobody cares about the other Silvers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaTheLostCanvas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiyaTheLostCanvas">Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas</a></em> is even worse. The only Silver Saint we know is Yuzuriha, nobody else is mentioned or play any important role. It doesn't help that this series focuses a LOT on the Golds (given that they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> in the classic series), and gives what other spotlight to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Tenma</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Yato</a>.

Specifically, he resents Batman for replacing him with another Robin and because he thinks he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> compared to Dick, the first Robin.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jason</strong>: But boy, Dick, you sure got game... Guess that's why "Dad" always loved you best.

<div class="indent"><strong>Tim</strong>: And yes, I know that makes me Cindy.
</div></li><li> Since Jason's being 'disowned' on account of being crazy, Tim has since been put into the middle child role between Dick and Damian Wayne and it only got worse when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bruce died, leaving Dick Grayson as the new Batman and Tim getting replaced by Damian</span>.

Ironically, however, it was <em>April</em> who ultimately suffered the most from this, becoming neglected and overlooked because her parents felt ready to 'retire' from being parents — and resented any reminder that they had a daughter who was still dependent on them.
<ul><li> There actually is one special in which <em>Elizabeth</em> gets this in spades, from being brushed off to being blamed for April (who was still a toddler at the time) breaking Elly's favorite ornament. When Elizabeth goes sledding and gets lost; a woman named Grace actually <em>inverts</em> this trope by telling her that sometimes, the middle child gets the best <em>because</em> they don't bear the responsibility and aren't <em>always</em> treated as a baby.

</li><li> Not so apparent with Arya because she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddysGirl">Daddy's Girl</a> but she's still the third child of Ned and Catelyn Stark's five children and the fourth child of Ned's six children (Arya has an older half-brother, Jon Snow, who is Ned's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">illegitimate son</a> and raised alongside his siblings) so it's still somewhat there. Two of her older siblings, Robb and Sansa, both easily fit into the responsibilities and expectations assigned to them; her older brothers Robb and Jon are raised side by side, mentored together by Ned, and are best friends, while her younger brothers Bran and Rickon are doted upon because they are the babies of the family. It doesn't help that she's a misfit herself as her tomboyish nature clashes with societal expectations while Sansa exemplifies societal expectations as a lady to near perfection. She's also the only one out of Catelyn's children who doesn't look like a Tully but looks all Stark — which is part of why she's so close with her half-brother Jon, also somewhat of an outsider like her, because she and Jon are the only two of Ned's kids to inherit the Stark look. This trope (and her being nine years old) is suggested to be why she acts out so much, especially in the first book.
</li><li> Viserys is the second(surviving) child of Aerys Targaryen. When compared to his older brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Rhaegar</a> and younger sister Daenerys, Viserys is unremarkable and pretty much a weakling. Whilst Rhaegar and Dany inherit much of the positive traits of the Targaryen bloodline, Viserys has nothing but his father's madness.

Tywin discounts the eldest child, Cersei, because she's a girl, and considers the youngest, Tyrion, a walking disappointment because he's a hedonistic dwarf.

Lettie is expected to work as an apprenticeship at a pastry shop, where she'll meet some nice man and have lots of children. Also, Martha is Sophie and Lettie's half-sister from their father's second marriage, which "ought to have made Sophie and Lettie into Ugly Sisters", but didn't.

</li><li> In the middle grade book "The Haunting of Grade Three" Joey Baker is one of twelve children and is described being not one of the older ones, and not one of the younger ones either. The only members of his family who are shown to pay attention are too of his older siblings who he seems to feel jealous of (for being a spieling bee champion and a football player) and he tells his friends that he's an only child who just happens to have the same last name as those other kids.

</li><li> Fredo Corleone of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> has this in spades. Sonny has the brawn, Michael has the brains, and Tom Hagen plays the traditional middle child role of mediating between them. While introducing Kay to his family during the novel's opening sections, Michael acknowledges that Fredo serves almost no purpose in the Corleone family.
<ul><li> In the book he's described as being the quintessential Italian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">Momma's Boy</a>, and he was essentially useless to the family business.
</li><li> In the Mark Winegartener sequel novels, it is implied that a severe case of pneumonia when Fredo was an infant was partially responsible for his behavior issues and/or mild retardation. In addition, he was also a heavily closeted homosexual, which is something of a no-no in Old World Italian values, and compensated by cultivating a reputation as a swinging ladies' man, which <em>also</em> went against his family's conservative upbringing. Following on from this, his "betrayal" in Part II came about because he wanted to start a racket of his own <em>(described in the novels as owning his own cemetery in New Jersey, giving him a piece of all the stonemasonry, flowers, landscaping, etc., that came through, not to mention the obvious benefits of a mobster owning a place to legally hide dead bodies)</em> in order to prove his independence and show that he could be successful and not reliant on his younger brother's largesse. It's also shown that Michael considers Fredo to be the unfavorite of his brothers; Nick Geraci, a Corleone <em>capo</em> and primary antagonist in the novels, thinks to himself that Fredo's idea has plenty of merit, but that Michael wouldn't give it any consideration just because it was Fredo's.
</li><li> Others outside the immediate Corleone family, though, consider Fredo to be the most likable. While Sonny had a hair-trigger temper and one always had to be on guard with Tom and Michael for subtle nuances and double meanings, Fredo had the distinction of being both friendly and harmless, the most easily approachable of the Corleones for a drink and casual conversation.

The younger sister of a beautiful, popular cheerleader and the older sister of a child prodigy genius, she has become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">Black Sheep</a> of the family, an artistic loner. Then she becomes the person to get the most attention when she saves the president from an assassination attempt (long story).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>:
<ul><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em>, where the middle child Marianne is her mother's favorite.
</li><li> Played straight elsewhere in the Austenverse; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>, there are five sisters. Everyone loves Jane, the eldest, who has the sweetest disposition and prettiest face. Elizabeth, second-eldest, is her father's favorite; Lydia, the youngest, is her mother's. Mary and Kitty, the third and fourth daughters respectively, enjoy no favoritism at all.
</li><li> In a meta sense, the middle Bingley child Louisa is the one who's frequently left out of adaptations. Eldest Charles is Jane's love interest, while youngest Caroline is a more memorable bitch.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructorFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructorFleet">Deconstructor Fleet</a> fantasy novel <em>Bring Me the Head of Prince Charming</em>, when Azazel decides that the middle son will be the most useful for his purposes because the middle son is the most neglected: The oldest son is the heir, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">youngest son goes on an adventure and thus becomes successful</a>, but the middle son enjoys neither kind of success.
</li><li> The Real Kids Readers book <em>Molly in the Middle</em> deals with Molly, her older sister Tina and younger sister Lucy. Molly's failed attempts to become the oldest, youngest, funniest, loudest, meanest, etc. take up most of the book until she realizes she is the "luckiest" because she doesn't get the disadvantages that come with being the oldest/youngest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Percy Weasley is the third brother in the Weasley clan. He's sort of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> in earlier books before he turns into a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, especially where Fred and George are involved. Everybody admires Bill and Charlie, everybody finds Fred and George fun to be around, Ginny is respected for her ability as a witch (plus she's both the youngest and the only girl of the family) and Ron does get some respect as Harry's best friend and for his later heroics. Percy, on the other hand, doesn't get much attention. Even his boss, Barty Crouch, Sr., calls him by the wrong name <em>to his face</em>! Percy is actually set up to be the favourite in book one <em>but</em> only because he was a prefect. He appears to be Molly's favourite, however the rest of his family don't seem to prefer him.
</li><li> Fred and George allude to this trope in the fifth book, where Molly coos over "everyone in the family" becoming prefects after Ron gets made one. The twins remind Molly that she ignored them when she said this.
</li><li> Ron also gets a hefty dose of this trope. As the sixth of seven children, he often gets overlooked, and the Weasley family's perpetual poverty means he normally gets saddled with hand-me-downs from his brothers instead of anything new. It's rather telling that what he sees in the Mirror of Erised is himself finally standing out and getting attention.
</li><li> Aberforth Dumbledore also shows shades of this. While no means dumb or a bad wizard, he is the best wizard in the world's little brother and there's just no way he could have ever outshone him. In Albus's obituary, his oldest friend Elphias admits that being outshone as someone's best friend for a century doesn't hold a candle to being that person's brother. Meanwhile, their younger sister Ariana was mentally ill from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a> and their mother had to care for her at all times, meaning she also outshone him. A lot of people say that Aberforth was quite wild as a teenager due to this and still resents his brother (albeit for some other, very understandable reasons as well) while they're both in their 110s.
</li></ul></li><li> Greg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiaryOfAWimpyKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiaryOfAWimpyKid">Diary of a Wimpy Kid</a></em> <em>is</em> this trope. How many times do you see Rodrick or Manny (usually Manny) getting the advantage over Greg? Because Rodrick is about 4 years older than Greg (and constantly getting in trouble) and Manny is a baby, they constantly get more attention. Debatably, this is one of the main premises of entire the series, especially the second and third books and movies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfMagic">Half Magic</a></em> is about four siblings in the 1920s (from oldest to youngest, Jane, Mark, Katharine, and Martha) finding a magic nickel that grants wishes by half (like if you wished for an ice-cream sundae, you'd get half an ice-cream sundae, etc.) Since Jane's the oldest, she calls the shots on everything. After Jane, Mark, and Martha have already made wishes, gotten themselves into trouble, and figured out how to use the magic charm correctly, Jane pulls an I-get-to-have-the-first-wish after they get back home, and this is what happens:
<div class="indent"><strong>Katharine</strong>: I don't see why. You always get dibs on first 'cause you're the oldest, and grown-ups always pick Martha, 'cause she's the baby, and Mark has a wonderful double life with all this and being a boy, too! Middle ones never get any privileges at all! Besides, who hasn't had a wish of her own yet? Think back! <em>(Previously, Jane had set a playhouse on fire, Martha had made their cat talk in half-understandable gibberish, and Mark had taken them to a desert.)</em>
</div></li><li> Abby from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmazingDaysOfAbbyHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAmazingDaysOfAbbyHayes">The Amazing Days of Abby Hayes</a></em> has this. Her older twin sisters Eva and Isabel constantly fight and excel in their chosen fields (sport and study, respectively), while her younger brother Alex excels in technological fields, meaning that Abby only gets attention if she goes out of her way to do so — something she doesn't like doing. Not to mention, nobody actually takes any notice of Abby's skill with creative writing.
<ul><li> It also turns up in the second book- Eva and Isabel get to go to the school fair by themselves, while Abby has to take Alex with her. Finally, she gets fed up enough to demand that rather than being used as the automatic solution for anything concerning Alex, she gets to ride to the fair with her friends instead. Everyone is very surprised at her demand.
</li><li> She also complains about it while writing about her wish for new rollerblades- Eva and Isabel, as the oldest siblings, get brand new rollerblades, and Alex, as the youngest, also gets new ones as the old ones won't fit. Abby, as the middle child, has to deal with the really shit castoffs.
</li></ul></li><li> In "Confessions of a Closet Catholic," Justine, known as 'Jussy,' notes that her mother loves her older sister Helena best, her father loves her younger brother Jake best because he is a boy and her mother even loves the French poodle, Bijou, more than her. It is subverted in the end though when her mother tells her that she may understand Helena better because they are alike but she doesn't love her more.
</li><li> In "Oh boy !", Siméon (14 years) is the gifted student, Venise (5 years) is very beautiful, and Morgane (9 years) is "only" a clever girl. People who talk about the fate of the children (they're orphans by the beginning of the book) often forget she exists.
</li><li> In <em>A Mango Shaped Space</em>, a psychiatrist chalks Mia's claims of hearing colors (a real disorder) up to this.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutsiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutsiders">The Outsiders</a></em> where Sodapop is well-liked by his brothers and within their little group. However, this status causes him stress because he is the only mediator between his younger brother Ponyboy and his older brother Darry, who tend to have opposite personality traits and end up in arguments while Sodapop is laid-back and even-tempered.
<ul><li> The book lampshades this trope; since most of the story is about Ponyboy's misadventures while eldest brother Darry is the breadwinner of the family who frequently clashes with Ponyboy, Sodapop is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> for most of the novel and it's not revealed until somewhat late that he 1) had a steady girlfriend, 2) knocked her up, and 3) was heartbroken when she broke up with him to move with her grandmother in Florida. When Ponyboy and Darry cease their fighting to tend to him, Ponyboy admits that they always assumed Sodapop had no problems of his own.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Sisters Club</em> played this perfectly straight with the middle sister, Stevie. Her older sister is the actress, and her younger sister is, of course, the cute one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy">Kushiel's Dart</a></em>, Joscelin admits that this is the case of noble families who end up pledging a son to the Cassilines (think a cross of priests and bodyguards). The eldest stay because they are the heir to the domain. The youngest stay to comfort their mothers. It's then a middle son who ends up being pledged to the order.
</li><li> Isabelle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em>, is always raring to go into fights, not to mention she consistently dates boys her parents would hate. Jace says she does it to get attention, as she is not only the only girl but also the middle child.
</li><li> Subverted in <em>Middle School Blues.</em> Main character Cindy's new friend Margo complains that the middle is absolutely the worst place to be born, while Cindy herself is a youngest child and hates the fact that no matter what she does, one of her sisters has done it first. Another friend Helen complains that as the oldest, she's expected to be perfect and set an example for her youngest sibling, and Cindy's best friend Becca is an only child, meaning that her parents never leave her alone. The four come to the conclusion that being a teenager sucks no matter where you were born.
</li><li> Stamped all over the royal family's sons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RealmOfTheElderlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RealmOfTheElderlings">The Farseer</a></em> trilogy. Eldest prince Chivalry was raised to rule, while youngest prince Regal is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a> whose mother (the king's second wife) considers him the "true" heir because her family was higher-ranking than the first queen's and so he's "more royal" than his brothers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">Chivalry's untimely death in a hunting accident</a> sets the events of the trilogy in motion, and puts middle son Verity on the spot - nobody has expected anything of him except maybe to watch the borders for his older brother, and after being neglected so long he was fine with that.
</li><li> Aya in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TanteiTeamKZJikenNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TanteiTeamKZJikenNote">Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note</a></em> is stuck between Yuki, her honour-student elder brother, and Nako, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DitzyGenius">Ditzy Genius</a> little sister, and thus sees herself as plain. As she says it in episode 3 of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>:
<div class="indent">"Smart, athletic and good-looking, my brother is my mom's pride and joy. And my cute, innocent sister, Nako... She's my mom's favourite. But I have friends, too, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">now</a>, I guess."
</div></li><li> Played completely straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfThereBeThorns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfThereBeThorns">If There Be Thorns</a>.</em> Cathy clearly favours handsome ballet star Jory and cute toddler Cindy (both are also blonde) over middle child Bart.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemaryWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RosemaryWells">Rosemary Wells</a>' character Nora who debuted in the book <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x17hsk2_noisy-nora_shortfilms">"Noisy Nora"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is usually trying to get her parents attention. Since they are mostly taking care of their new baby brother. She would usually get her parents' attention by making tons of noise such as slamming the door or knocking the lamp down. This is also shown in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimothyGoesToSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimothyGoesToSchool">Timothy Goes to School</a></em> since Nora is one of the main characters. But not as much of the original book.
</li><li> Petrova of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BalletShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BalletShoes">Ballet Shoes</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> of the bunch. Eldest Pauline is the pretty one and gets enough charisma to become an actress. Youngest Posy has enough dance talent to be trained exclusively by an accomplished ballerina. Petrova is the plain one who gets hardly any encouragement. Although in a twist, in the 2007 film adaptation, Petrova gets the most scenes with Garnie and is the one who is told about the family's situation - implying she might be Garnie's preferred daughter. She never gets reprimanded like the other two.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></em>, this was initially one of Edmund's many issues. Peter and Susan were "the older ones" and Lucy was babied as the youngest, while Edmund feels like he just gets in the way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TailchasersSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TailchasersSong">Tailchaser's Song</a></em>: Grizraz Hearteater is the middle child between Viror Whitewind and Tangaloor Firefoot. He wasn't as agile as his older brother or as smart as his younger brother, so he became bitter and envious. His jealousy caused him to try and kill his siblings. After being banished underground for killing Whitewind and attempting to kill Firefoot, Hearteater's rage and jealousy grew over time until he became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalisticAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalisticAbomination">Animalistic Abomination</a>. Centuries later he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight">burns in the sunlight</a> and is bent on destroying the sun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeeYouAtHarrys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeeYouAtHarrys">See You At Harrys</a></em> has Fern, who is often glossed over by her parents in favor of issues regarding her older siblings, Sara and Holden, and her younger brother, Charlie. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, she's only this for the first half of the book; after Charlie's passing she becomes the youngest again.</span>
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PumpkinPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PumpkinPie">Pumpkin Pie</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanUre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanUre">Jean Ure</a> has Jenny (aka: Pumpkin), who is the middle child between her gorgeous older sister, Petal, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> younger brother, Pip. She often comments that she feels overlooked because she doesn't have an outstanding personality trait like her siblings and her being somewhat ignored is partly how she manages to get away with her eating disorder for so long before somebody notices it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Stannis Baratheon resents the fact that people in general have a much more favourable view of his older and younger brother. Robert gets most of the credit for winning the rebellion against the Mad King, while Stannis' contribution is hardly acknowledged. When the War of Five Kings begins, <em>all</em> of the Stormlands bannermen side with Renly even though Stannis is the lawful successor to the Iron Throne.
</li><li> With the Sand Snakes focused on the 3 eldest while the ones that are still children are kept offscreen, Obara (the oldest) and Tyene (the youngest) get more attention. Obara is the most aggressive and gets some exposition on her backstory, and Tyene has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Bronn and appears to be her mother's favorite. Nymeria mostly rolls her eyes whenever one of the others does something.
</li></ul></li><li> Tommy on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrothersAndSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrothersAndSisters">Brothers &amp; Sisters</a></em>. Extra angst in that while he is the oldest Walker <em>son</em>, he is the middle of five (legitimate) children. His father William seemed to open hold his older sister Sarah's business skills in higher regard, bringing her in to run the family fruit company even though Tommy had worked there for years. He also showed varying degrees of resentment towards his other siblings, especially his troubled youngest brother Justin who he feels his parents coddled.
</li><li> Stephanie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> even had an episode dedicated to her fear that she'd never be as good or loved as her sisters. She has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> where both DJ and Michelle upstage her at everything. (She became an astronaut, went to Mars, and <em>learned to fly.</em> She gets upstaged when DJ went to get the mail and Michelle <em>blinked</em>.) She basically becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">the snarky one</a> in later years to deal with it, like Darlene below.
</li><li> Barry on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs">The Goldbergs</a></em>, although he does his best to hide it with his extreme overconfidence. It's a major driving force of the plot in one season 6 episode.
</li><li> Gary Ewing on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em> was this in spades. Oldest J.R. is the most like their father and inherited Ewing Oil, Bobby is the most beloved by the family and inherited family ranch Southfork. Gary, who was considered weak by his father, is routinely ignored and when his alcoholism gets bad enough in the backstory, is effectively cast out of the family. His parents later make amends but he still never plays any role in the family dynasty.
<ul><li> When Jock Ewing died, and the sons met up for the will-reading, J.R. and Bobby each effectively got 50% of the estate while Gary and Jock's illegitimate son Ray just got a lump sum of some money (admittedly millions), but Gary wasn't even allowed access to it unless he could prove he wouldn't squander it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">The Brady Bunch</a></em>: Jan Brady is probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>. Peter also has moments where he suffers a little ("Cyrano de Brady", for one), though of the boys, Bobby, while being the youngest, not middle boy, has him beat with all his insecurities. It's revealed that Alice suffered from this as well when she was growing up, allowing her to sympathize with Jan.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em>: The eponymous Malcolm had this trope in spades.
<ul><li> Except that Lois mistreats <em>all</em> her children, Malcolm just got it the worst because she actually <em>cares</em> about his future, due to his high IQ.
</li><li> Also played with, as of Jamie's birth, Reese and Dewey are middle children too, even though only Malcolm gets this treatment.
</li></ul></li><li> President Bartlet's middle daughter Ellie clearly suffers something like this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>; she and her father have a difficult relationship, but when pressed Bartlet will angrily deny that he loves one of his children less than the others.
<ul><li> Interestingly, he also says that "she's always belonged to Abbey," implying that from his point of view, <em>he's</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> <em>parent</em>. (They end up having a nice moment at the end of the episode, of course.)
<ul><li> Yeah, it seems to depend sort of who you're looking at. Zoey is Jed's favorite, but Ellie is Abbey's. Oldest daughter Liz, married to a guy the family can't stand and a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a>, may in fact be the most neglected by the family.
</li></ul></li><li> If you take the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> to the full nuclear family extent, with President Bartlet and Leo as the parents, Josh is this trope  Toby is the oldest, the best adviser, the only one who's close to being Leo's equal. CJ is the only daughter, whom everyone depends on. Sam is the kind little brother who's always helpful. Charlie is the baby whom every one protects and adores. Set between CJ and Sam, Josh is very much the rambunctious troublemaker who is always being made fun of and scolded. Slightly subverted, however, by the fact that he's actually Leo's <em>favorite</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Cory suffers from this every now and then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em>. More so early on, before Eric is cemented as the family screw-up and Morgan stops having any story or relevance whatsoever (at one point disappearing entirely for a season or two before showing up again being played by a new, preteen actress).
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>, Piper suffers from this because Prue was a hard-working career woman and Phoebe was adventurous. She felt like the peacekeeper and the most normal one. After Prue died, Piper became the oldest and Phoebe became the middle. But, Phoebe still acted like the youngest and Paige acted like the middle child. Averted when their mother visits Piper on her wedding day and says "I always knew you'd be the first to get married. You're the heart of this family, Piper."
</li><li> Darlene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> was overshadowed by both of her siblings: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGloriousWarOfSisterlyRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGloriousWarOfSisterlyRivalry">beautiful and smart Becky</a>, and DJ who was both the baby and the only boy. This largely led to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnarkKnight">gothy and cynical</a> demeanor. What subverts this trope, however, is that of the three Connor children, she was the most popular with viewers and had ample screentime as a result. However, this became averted in later seasons. When both Becky and Darlene were in those "Awkward Teenage Years" that sitcoms are so fond of, D.J. was the one who went out of focus, since he was the quiet Good Child and the parents were working so hard they could only afford to give the squeaky wheels the grease. At the end of one episode, he told his parents to their surprise that he hadn't spoken a single word in two days, and no one noticed. Sadly, we only caught a glimpse of DJ entering puberty, since the series ended when he was 14.
<div class="indent"><strong>Roseanne</strong>: He'd better start bitching and moaning like his sisters if he's gonna make it in this family.
</div></li><li> Sue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddle">The Middle</a></em>. And not <em>just</em> because she has a rather generic name while her siblings are named "Axel" and "Brick", but because, as she puts it in an episode, she's not a successful athlete like Axl nor "supersmart" like Brick. Both of her brothers tend to stand out for sports or intellectual abilities respectively. She calls Frankie out on this when she tries to get Sue to stop running for her cross country met so she could go to Axel's football game, though this argument is completely ineffective because absolutely everyone else had finished the run and went home hours ago and she was lost. Frankie then admits that she does care more for being there for Axels moments than Sues, but because she knows Sue will always show her love while Axel is a lazy teenager with an attitude who wants as little to do with his parents as possible and she just wants to be there for when he's most likely to let her be his mother again.
</li><li> Kerry in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightSimpleRules">8 Simple Rules</a></em>. She feels left out because a)her older sister is popular at school and has more responsibilities that their parents would like her to focus on more, and b)her only younger sibling is also the only son for their parents (their father in particular bonded with him more). Kerry isn't an entirely straight example of the trope, however. Most of the season 1 episodes involve her father desperately trying to bond with her - while she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangsts</a> about being the Middle Child.

<ul><li> Hayley is the middle child in between Sydney and Justin. In one episode she counts the number of photos each child has in the family albums - and she has twenty less than the oldest and youngest siblings. When she brings this up to her parents, they try to make it up to her in a very heartwarming scene where they take lots of pictures of her at once, showing that they do love her very much.
</li><li> With the revelation in Season 3 that they have a brother, Hope and Faith themselves invert the trope. Faith is the middle child now but is the central character of the show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reba">Reba</a></em> presents for this trope Kyra, who's stuck between her older, more popular sister (who has a child of her own, most likely warranting more attention from their parents) and her only younger sibling — the adorable one and only son. Needless to say, she's not happy about this.
<ul><li> The last season more or less averts this, though, as Jake, the youngest child, falls out of focus and rarely appears while Kyra still makes a few more appearances before disappearing as well.

In the shows early years she was always given the shaft by her parents in favor of her newly-discovered cousin Charity Standish and her younger sister Jessica (Noah, the oldest, was away in college.) At one point, her mom uses money Kay saved up for a car and gives it to Charity. She eventually moves out of the house and lives with resident witch Tabitha (who hates the Bennett/Standish family.)

With Mary being the glamorous daughter that everyone adores and Sybil being the kind-hearted baby of the family, Edith is left as the odd one out. In Season 2, she manages to break out of it somewhat when she becomes the favourite among the soldiers staying in the estate.
</li><li> Randy Taylor on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em> was the middle child which led to his deadpan humor.
<ul><li> His father Tim Taylor was also a middle child (though not the only one in the Taylor family) which may partially explain his constant attempts to impress others with <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology">MORE POWER</a></strong>. Because of this, one episode featured Tim and Randy having a talk where Tim acknowledges their similar personalities and reactions to things (such as the death of a loved one in that episode), as opposed to Tim and Brad's having similar interests.

<ul><li> Leonard. While his mother refuses to recognize she's proud of the accomplishments of ANY of her children (after all they're not her accomplishments) Leonard gets it the worst. His older sister is close to curing diabetes, his brother is a successful lawyer that's engaged to an Olympian, while everyone harps on poor Leonard for "only" being a theoretical physicist and not doing "original research" but instead designing experiments for and validating the results of the work of others. He makes a point of not talking about his siblings much.
</li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> in an episode. Sheldon had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">hired an actor to pose as his drug-addict cousin to whose intervention he and Leonard had supposedly attended, in order to have an excuse so as not to go to Penny's concert</a>. When discussing "the cousin's" backstory, Sheldon wants him to blame his addiction on being the middle child and not having gotten enough attention. The actor (also a scientist), however, doesn't think this is a valid reason because of the lack of research.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in that it explains why Alex from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em> does what she does (she's not only the middle child but a daughter), and inverted/lampshaded in the episode where Aunt Megan is introduced.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> downplays this with Martha (one of the few companions who didn't suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome">Only Child Syndrome</a>). While she's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> in the family, she seems to have been stuck as the go-between for everyone else's issues; her first scene has her being bombarded with calls while on the way to work. She also, oddly enough, seems to have become stuck with a meta-version of this, as the middle companion of the Russel T. Davies era. Both fans and official media often seem to ignore her in favour of Rose and Donna, with only the occasional mention of her being the show's "first black companion" (which ignores Mickey). She has her fans of course, but they're not nearly as outspoken. Some of this is probably due to Martha being more of an original series type companion. She travels with The Doctor for a time and moves on when the time comes. Most of the other female companions of the new series have had some sort of special destiny in some way (Bad Wolf, Doctor Donna, The Girl Who Waited, The Impossible Girl, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The First Cyberman</span>).
</li><li> Andre from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Empire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Empire">Empire</a></em> gets this despite being the eldest, because he comes from a family of musicians: dad Lucious is a rap legend, mom Cookie is a producer, middle brother Jamal is an R&amp;B singer, youngest brother Hakeem is another rapper, and Andre...is an accountant. Granted, he's the CFO of his family's record company, but he's often overlooked in favor of his more musically-inclined brothers. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobAndEsau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobAndEsau">Jacob and Esau</a> nature of his parents' relationship with his brothers lends itself to this trope; Lucious is grooming Hakeem to be his successor while at odds with Jamal for being gay, while Cookie is Jamal's manager and supports his endeavors but has a rocky relationship with Hakeem, who resents her for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">in prison</a> when he was growing up. Andre, meanwhile, despite his professional accomplishments, is just "meh" in both his parents' eyes, which is quite literally driving him insane.

<ul><li> Although George of Clarence is Duchess Cecily's favourite among her children, he nonetheless believes that his brothers never appreciated or loved him enough.

<div class="indent"><strong>George</strong>: I stand there like a beggar with a bowl, and my brothers put their crumbs in it. It's always been those two, since we were children. Me out on my own, or with my mother.

Second, George's oppression is largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BourgeoisBumpkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BourgeoisBumpkin">in his own head</a>. In the series, he is shown receiving and acquiring giant helpings of land and money even after betraying his family twice (the second time re-opening the succession war and killing several thousand people), yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntitledBastard">still complains</a> that he doesn't get even more!

<div class="indent"><strong>Yakko</strong>: Middle kid syndrome.
</div></li><li> Even more inexplicable than his British accent, in the Spanish dub, Wakko is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossDressingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossDressingVoice">voiced by a woman (Giset Blanco)</a>, who not only makes him sound like a woman but is also rather inconsistent with his voice. Sometimes, he sounds low and hoarse; other times, he's nasally; still other times, he's very high-pitched..
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em>: Tina and Louise will occasionally chalk up their brother Gene's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">eccentric behavior</a> to him being the middle child (like his obsession with his new Sasquatch mask in "Beefsquatch").
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> are triplets and, thus, the same age, Buttercup still falls right into Middle Child Syndrome by being noticeably more cynical and snarky than Blossom and Bubbles, who in turn behave like an Oldest and Youngest Child respectively. According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, this is because while Blossom and Bubbles got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Names</a>, Buttercup got saddled with her name just for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: Lampshaded by Lisa: "Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, happy birthday overlooked middle child, happy birthday to me." Which is strange because a lot of episodes show she's a likely candidate as Homer's favorite (He takes her places she likes that he finds boring, helped out with her soccer team, stuff like that). For him, Maggie is more this trope, since there are times he even forgets she exists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a></em>: Simon, despite being the tallest, smartest, and most mature of the Chipmunks, is the middle child. Even though Alvin is shorter and the most rambunctious, he is actually the oldest. One episode of the '80s series has Simon feeling he doesn't get as much attention because Alvin is a troublemaker and Theodore is a crybaby; eventually David tells him that he loves them equally but Simon doesn't need as much attention because he's the most mature of them and knows better than they do.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title character's mom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorkaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorkaholic">Helen</a> was the middle child, with older sister Rita being the beautiful outgoing one and younger sister Amy being the rebellious one, which led to Helen becoming the over-achieving academic one to get attention. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a>, however, when her sisters reveal that they think of <em>her</em> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">the favorite</a>, since she was always off winning awards "to make us look lazy."
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">tie-in book</a> shows Jodie's family. She's the "super-student" that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">her parents</a> want, she has a new brother named Evan whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">her dad's always wanted</a>...and then there's ten-year-old Rachel, a "so-so student" who seems very bitter at Evan for taking her status as the "baby" of the family.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a></em>: Wannabe-superhero Baby Boomerangutan is a man dressed as an orangutan who carries three baby dolls he can throw at evildoers. The middle child (which he explicitly calls as such) is only employed in dire emergencies because it's stuffed with explosives.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> focuses on Lincoln, who's not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutnumberedSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutnumberedSibling">the only boy</a> out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings">eleven siblings</a>, but smack-dab in the middle to boot, with five older and five younger sisters.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears">We Bare Bears</a></em> with Panda being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyOfTheBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyOfTheBunch">The Baby of the Bunch</a> as he's constantly being coddled or protected by is older brother Grizz or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLittleBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLittleBrother">younger brother</a> Ice Bear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>: With Huey being the responsible and reliable oldest brother, and Louie being the youngest brother who always needs to have someone keeping an eye on him to keep him out of trouble, that leaves Dewey being mostly indistinguishable from his siblings. That results in him being the most outgoing, the most willing to make new friends, and the most boldly adventurous of the triplets.
