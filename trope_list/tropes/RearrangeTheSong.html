<p>A trope growing more common every day. Need to breathe new life into old material, or just a way of keeping viewers tuning in? Rearrange The Song associated with the property. It's a way to make old material fresh, or to take advantage of current musical trends and fads.
</p><p>The staff of TV shows which have been running for many seasons have, on occasion, rearranged the theme song newly each season. A show that has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> sequel will occasionally arrange the new show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune">Theme Tune</a> to hearken back to the original show. The beneficial effect of this, of course, is that they now have multiple versions of a song to appeal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">multiple demographics</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>With musicians, they can sometimes do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion">cover versions</a> of their own material as a method of pushing the envelope with their own work. Musicians also do it with other people's work as parody or homage.
</p><p>See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariationsOnAThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariationsOnAThemeSong">Variations on a Theme Song</a> for when the main theme of a work is changed for a single episode.

<ul><li> No theme has been rearranged more than the classic crooner's tune "Fly Me To The Moon" (itself a heavily rearranged version of an old waltz), which was the ending for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. There's about 15 to 20 versions used for the show's ending, and that's for a 26-episode TV series. The <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> rendition "Fly Me To The Moon" is of itself a rearrangement. It was originally written by Bart Howard in 1954.
</li><li> The original Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> got a new version of its theme song ("Moonlight Densetsu") for its third season. The new version had actresses behind Moon, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Venus doing the singing instead of DALI.
</li><li> There are currently three different versions of "New Moon ni Koi Shite", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em>'s Season 3 opening theme.
</li><li> The dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> is an interesting case. The first season theme was really just the first minute of the full theme song. The second season theme was a different piece of music from later in the same song. It bounced back after that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em>Johto League Champions</em> season did a redo of the first theme for their opening. It didn't have quite the same lyrics at first (and a different refrain), but it's clear that it was to match the Japanese version (which remixed <em>Mezase Pokémon Master</em>...but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RicaMatsumoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RicaMatsumoto">Rica Matsumoto</a> didn't sing this version).
</li><li> The <em>XY</em> season uses a third redo of the first theme, this time a straight cover rather than something along the lines of "Born to Be a Winner". Interestingly this <em>doesn't</em> match up with the Japanese version, which uses an original song instead of an arrangement of "Mezase".
</li><li> Additionally, the English versions of the first four theme songs were remixed in the beginning of the first four movies, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonHeroes">the fifth movie</a> simply had an extended version of the anime's fifth theme song. The rest of the movies averted this trend, while the first <em>Diamond and Pearl</em> movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheRiseOfDarkrai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonTheRiseOfDarkrai">Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai</a></em>, inverted the trend by having a completely new song, "We Will Be Heroes". This song was later remixed into the theme for the <em>DP: Battle Dimension</em> season of the <em>Diamond and Pearl</em> anime series.
</li><li> Several songs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">the games</a> receive remixes in the anime.
</li><li> <em>Mezase Pokemon Master</em> was remixed again for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou">the 20th anniversary movie</a>, while the dub used another remix of the first opening.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> series are notorious for this, as with a class of 31, one song can be remixed several times. The opening themes of both anime, plus the ending theme of the second, have gone through this.
</li><li> While not quite as numerous as other examples, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrikeWitches">Strike Witches</a></em> used this as well. The girls, in different duets, took turns covering the ending theme, with the final episode having all of them singing at once.
</li><li> The Italian edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> (Lamu') replaces the original slow opening song with a fast, catchy pop song. It's most notable because no one knows who wrote it, who performs it, nor is there apparently a complete version anywhere - it's frustrating, because it's such a catchy piece and so very appropriate for the series, too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Akikan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Akikan">Akikan!</a>!</em> may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime">12-Episode Anime</a>, but it remixes the ending theme in every episode.
</li><li> The first opening song for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> was remixed with the lyrics altered and new singers and was used as the sixth opening. The tenth opening uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoItYourselfThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoItYourselfThemeTune">a version of the first theme sung by the members of the platoon</a>, though it had been in existence prior. The second and third movies also used remixed versions of the opening theme.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GAGeijutsukaArtDesignClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GAGeijutsukaArtDesignClass">GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class</a></em> has five different versions of "Coloring palettes", its ending theme. Tomokane's and Noda's are upbeat, whereas Kisaragi and Professor's versions are a little more relaxed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> has an entire <em>soundtrack</em>, <em>Yuusha-Oh Tanjou! 10 RenHatsu!!</em>, devoted to the various versions of its theme song, <em>Yuusha-Oh Tanjou!</em>. Included in this are the original, Mythology (from FINAL), Grand Glorious Gathering (from FINAL -Grand Glorious Gathering-), ultimate extra (sung by the artists who sung the theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Betterman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Betterman">Betterman</a></em>), Ultimate Mythology and Perfect Yell (original and Ultimate Mythology with soundclips from the series) It powerfully rearranges its own ending theme for the very end of <em>FINAL</em> by having it sung by the character voices themselves.
</li><li> The second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK">Welcome to the N.H.K.</a></em> uses a more downbeat version of the opening, to match the show's mood shift.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LastExile">Last Exile</a></em>'s ending theme, "Over the Sky", was given a much longer and more emotional version, "Over the Sky Angel Feather ver." for the final episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure">Fresh Pretty Cure!</a></em> reworked its opening theme song (which was considered to be badly sung by some fans) at the same time that the opening itself was edited to reflect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Setsuna</a>'s new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">alignment</a></span>.
</li><li> Ditto for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuitePrettyCure">Suite Pretty Cure ♪</a></em> opening, just ignore the "badly sung" part <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and replace "Setsuna" with "Siren/Ellen"</span>.
</li><li> Prior to that, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCureSplashStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCureSplashStar">Futari wa Pretty Cure Splash★Star</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5">Yes! Pretty Cure 5</a></em>, and <em>Yes! Pretty Cure 5GoGo</em> all used various versions of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancingTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancingTheme">Ganbalance de Dance</a>" as their second ending theme. Amusingly, <em>Fresh,</em> which had dancing as a major focus of the series, was the series that broke this trend.
</li><li> Prior to all of them was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a> Max Heart</em>, who modified <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em>'s theme "DANZEN! Futari Wa Pretty Cure" to a more action-packed theme, "DANZEN! Futari Wa Pretty Cure (ver. Max Heart)"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">HeartCatch Pretty Cure!</a></em> had their opening and ending remixed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, which hadn't been done in other versions prior or afterward.
</li><li> The first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars">Pretty Cure All Stars</a></em> movies had the same theme remixed with each movie, mostly to accommodate the new season (Heartcatch for the second and Suite for the third)
<ul><li> The fifth and sixth <em>All Stars</em> movies remixes the new theme, "Precure ~Eien no Tomodatchi~", from the fourth movie. Movie six also rearranges "Precure Memory", the end theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure">Happiness Charge Pretty Cure</a></em> by having all nine Pink-type Cure seiyuu sing it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MahoGirlsPrecure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MahoGirlsPrecure">Maho Girls PreCure</a></em> had a re-arranged opening for the second half that was a rock version with different lyrics.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> dub, compare the theme for the seasons based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> and the theme for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> season. Essentially the same, but the former is kind of techno and the latter uses more rock guitar instead. In the Japanese version, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri">Digimon Adventure tri.</a></em> uses the opening theme from the original series, except it has been rearranged to the point where it barely sounds like the same song. YMMV on whether it's for better or worse, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BottleFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BottleFairy">Bottle Fairy</a></em> has five variations of its ending theme, each sung by a different fairy about a different season, the final one being sung by the four of them together about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SweetDreamsFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/SweetDreamsFuel">fuzzy feelings</a> felt throughout the year.
</li><li> By this point, it's nigh-impossible to count how many versions of the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> theme there are.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiGiCharatNyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiGiCharatNyo">Di Gi Charat Nyo</a></em> used a remix of Equal Romace, an end theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, as its ending theme.
</li><li> The second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> does this an interesting way. It plays the tune of the first season; <em>backwards</em>, with enough variation to be an actual tune.
</li><li> So far, the ending theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SasamisanAtGanbaranai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SasamisanAtGanbaranai">Sasami-san@Ganbaranai</a></em> has had a new version for each episode.

What's interesting is that each rearrangement was made for the sake of pandering to a specific demographic. The first season, most likely to suggest family appeal, used a light/gentle rendition of the show's core theme (though the first three episodes used a modified version of this theme, while several episodes in the middle used another modified version). Season 2, in an effort to appeal to a younger demographic, switched to a more upbeat disco rendition of the show's theme, with no less than <em>four</em> different arrangements. Season 3, in an effort to regain lost members of the first season's audience, used a single theme tune that was more similar to the first season's theme(s), albeit a little harsher. While, for Season 4, the writers used an upbeat/comedic rendition of the theme.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBill">The Bill</a></em> has rearranged its theme music five times in its 26 years on the air. The original 19841987 version of the theme was arranged in the irregular time signature of 7/4, giving it almost a reggae style beat. While this was kept in most subsequent arrangements, one in particularthe one used from 19982001was arranged in the regular time signature of 4/4, making it considerably less interesting as a result, and earning the ire of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillBailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillBailey">Bill Bailey</a> in the process. In 2009 however, the theme was changed completely, to a darker and edgier theme to fit with the show's retool, albeit with a small homage to the original theme.

It was a pretty standard mid-80's sitcom theme in its first season. But in later seasons it was rearranged as a peppy dance tune (season two), salsa song (season three), a cappella performed by Bobby McFerrin (season four), a ballet (season five), a Motown-styled dance tune (seasons six and seven) and in the final season, a hip hop song crossed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">homage</a> to the old song "Shotgun."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains">Growing Pains</a></em> always had the same theme song, but there were different versions of it. BJ Thomas was the main vocalist from 1985-1991, using a solo version for the first year before being joined by Jennifer Warnes and later, Dusty Springfield; the music itself was reworked a couple of times. During the final season, an a capella version was used.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> has rearranged its theme several times: three times in the '80s to "modernize" it (with the first '80s version being the only one besides the original Delia Derbyshire version to be made in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop), again in the TV movie, then four times with the new series.
<ul><li> There was also an attempt to completely rearrange the theme tune in the early 70s, by Paddy Kingsland of the Radiophonic Workshop, assisted by Brian Hodgson and Delia Derbyshire (both from there as well), on the Workshop's new EMS Synthi-100 modular synthesizer (nicknamed the "Delaware"), stated by Hodgson to be done "just to see if we could do it". They did it...but it turned out quite awful. It was never used in the programme (except in copies of some Season 10 episodes accidentally sent to Australia, which still had the Delaware version instead of the Delia Derbyshire version that was dubbed back into all other copies).
</li><li> The original Radiophonic Workshop version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> theme underwent a few rearrangements in the 60s and 70s. Arranger Delia Derbyshire added "electronic spangles" and an echo effect for the Patrick Troughton incarnation, and then in the 70s she added the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSting">electronic "scream"</a> preceding the closing titles and introduced the sound effect at the end to the televised theme for the first time (it was in the full version of the original 1963 theme).
</li><li> Series 1-3 of the new series use orchestral arrangements of the theme played over the top of the Delia Derbyshire version, while series 4 rearranges some of the orchestral elements and adds guitars and drums, giving it a rock and roll theme. Series 5-6 and part 1 of 7 is more electronic uses a bassline reminiscent of the 80s versions (and is rather funky) accompanied by a new grand and haunting orchestral melody, a constant synthesized, drum machine-like rhythm, and even a chorus. Series 7 Part 2 slightly modifies the timbre of the bassline and the electronic lead, has a different drum pattern, with real drums this time, and removes some of the orchestral elements from the previous theme to give it a slightly more minimalistic feel.
</li><li> In Series 3 of the new series, "Martha's Theme" sounds almost like a reworking of "The Doctor Forever," the 10th Doctor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">leitmotif</a> from that series (or vice-versa, given their introduction around the same time).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em> also rearranged their version of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">Baba O'Riley</a>" in Season 4.
</li><li> The 1978 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">Superman</a></em>'s theme music is a inversion. The actual tune is rarely the same twice, but it is all arranged similarly, to a bright, swelling, heroic theme with a lot of brass. Three different composers, but the listener will hear the song and think "Superman". (A few creators have found that, if you were to set lyrics to the various Superman themes to the tune of the main melody, there would be a spot where "Superman" fits perfectly.)

The hero's five include the original Double-Action AKA "Sword Form" (eurobeat), "Rod Form" (ska), "Ax Form" (enka), "Gun Form" (hip-hop/rap) and "Wing Form" (Arab pop); in addition, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">the first movie's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> gets "Gaoh Form", a solo death metal version, a bonus pop version was made, named "Coffee Form" and sung by the hero's sister and one of his allies, both coffee aficionados, and for the second movie "Climax Form" sung by the Taros and Deneb. Related are "Real-Action", a straight rock song sung solo by the hero, and "Action-ZERO", an original hard rock theme for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>. The show's opening theme, "Climax Jump", has gone through a similar treatment, with a quartet version sung by the Taros as well as individual versions made for the third movie, and two new versions, "The Final" for the third movie, and "Ch? Climax Jump" from the fourth movie, which is also an ensemble song. On one of the soundtracks is a song titled "DEN-O VOCAL TRACKS LINER (C-J D-A nonstop re-connection)" which is a remix of all of the songs released up to that point into a single 8 minute track.
<ul><li> Following the example of <em>Den-O</em>, its successor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKiva">Kamen Rider Kiva</a></em> had three mixes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a>'s theme "Individual-System" (the standard version sung by the star, and two remixes, "Fight for Justice" and "Don't Lose Yourself", sung by the rival to reflect his changing attitude over the series). About a year after the show ended, a reunion album was released, which included more remixes, such as the main character and his father swapping their respective theme tunes.
<ul><li> And its successor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a></em> included a series of albums that rearranged all of the theme songs of the nine previous series by the official rock band RIDER CHIPS and "Climax Jump"'s composer Shuhei Naruse. This resulted in <strong>two more</strong> versions of "Climax Jump".
</li><li> And then along comes the fifth <em>Den-O</em> movie, split into three separate movies, each with its own song. The first gets a ballad version of "Action-ZERO", the second a mix of Double-Action for the hero's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Grandkid From The Future</a> and his partner (rock 'n roll), and the third gets "Climax-Action ~The Den-O History~", which is said to be a combination of <strong>every</strong> version of "Climax Jump" and "Double-Action" to date.

</li><li> Perhaps taking a cue from <em>Den-O</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EngineSentaiGoOnger">Engine Sentai Go-onger</a></em>'s ending theme comes in several cover versions as well. Each of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> trios has their own mix ("Engine First Rap -Type Normal-", "Second Rap -Turbo Custom-", "Third Rap -Aero-Dynamic Custom-", "Final Rap -Type Evolution"), then there's one that's a musical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesop</a> ("Engine Eco Rap -Recycle Custom-"), one for The Movie ("Engine Formation Rap -GekijouBANG! Custom-"), a cover sung exclusively by the show's female cast ("G3 Princess Rap ~Pretty Love Limited~"), a cover sung exclusively by the show's <em>male</em> cast ("G5 Prince Rap ~Bombaye Limited"), and then a final version covering all 12 of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> for the finale ("Engine Winning Run -Type Formula-"). The five songs for the mecha (First, Second, Third, &amp; Final Lap, and Winning Run) were later strung into a continuous 17 minute song for a soundtrack release.

The season after <em>Zeo</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em>, worked in the six-note "Go, go, Power Rangers!" riff, but was otherwise unique. Years later, Saban's reclaiming of the franchise led them to resurrect the theme and use an updated version for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMegaforce">Megaforce</a></em> (with minor differences between the two), which was then remixed again for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge">Power Rangers Dino Charge</a></em> with lines added to the chorus and entirely new verses.
<ul><li> Recently, Ron Wasserman, the man who helped create many of the MMPR songs, went back and made new mixes of them and released them under the title "Power Rangers Redux".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> had its theme song lyrics changed several times throughout its run to reflect on changes within the show (such the switch from Joel to Mike).
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://i.redd.it/jpmgrn3kf0sy.png">Here's a handy-dandy flowchart<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> laying out the various permutations of the theme.
<ul><li> There are currently 7 variations of the song - the KTMA version, the season 1-5 version (with season 2's visuals changing to replace Larry with Frank), the season 5.5-6 version (to bring in Mike), the season 7 version (replacing Frank with Pearl), the season 8-9 version (the "Endless Chase" version), the season 10 version (Castle Forrester) and the season 11/Netflix version.
</li></ul></li><li> Also a slower-tempo instrumental version of the theme plays during the closing credits.
</li><li> The Netflix revival not only remixed the theme again, but also remixed various classic songs from the first 10 years.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a>'s <em>Unplugged</em> series is pretty much devoted to this trope.
</li><li> Each episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner (1967)</a></em> used a slightly different mix of its opening theme tune.
</li><li> The final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em> used a faster and jollier muzak-like version of the theme for its end credits only, without changing the opening credit version. This created a rather odd effect after some of the grimmer episodes of the show, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">the last one</a>.
<ul><li> Incoming producer Vere Lorrimer wanted lyrics over the end credits. They were going to be sung by Steven Pacey (Tarrant). Thankfully we were spared that.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> used a remixed version of its theme song each season. In later seasons, the singers they used represented a theme of that season. Ex: Season 4 was about the plight of young black boys in Baltimore, and the theme was sung by a Boy's Choir.
<ul><li> The song is called "Way Down In The Hole," originally by Tom Waits. Season Two uses his original version of the song, while the other four seasons use cover versions of it.
</li></ul></li><li> The first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SmallWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SmallWonder">Small Wonder</a></em> had a bouncy tune that didn't match it at all. The third season debuted a quasi-techno arrangement that was marginally better. (The lyrics were still terrible.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a>'s</em> theme song is known for its saxophone version, but some seasons have it played on the electric guitar. Vocals are added in the final season, which annoyed some fans. However, it redeems itself in the series' very last shot, where a woman sings the tune a cappella as Rosie goes from her writing room to the living room and watches TV, before everything fades to black.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> changed its theme song several times, and rearranged what it had.
<ul><li> The show's second (not counting pilots) theme, Griffin's own "Changing Keys" (introduced in August 1983), was re-orchestrated in 1984 (this version is the most familiar, as it appeared on an official game show themes compilation), 1989, 1992 (bizarrely, many episodes in this era still used the 1989 version anyway), 1994, and 1997, with the last two remixes making radical changes to the melody (although the 1994 version also had an alternate mix that stuck closer to the original). In addition to these, <em>after</em> the melody was changed in 1994, a few episodes used variations of the pre-1994 melody: a marching band version for episodes taped on the USS <em>Dwight D. Eisenhower</em> in 1995, another marching band version for College Weeks in 1995 and 1996, and a lap steel guitar version for weeks taped in Hawaii in 1996.
</li><li> A separate opening theme was introduced in 1998 for road shows. This was still used until around 2007.
</li><li> "Happy Wheels", first introduced in September 2000, was remixed in 2002 and again in 2007. The 2002-2007 mix even sampled the 1997 version of "Changing Keys".
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the 1980s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> theme has gone through five orchestrations in its time. Spinoff <em>Rock &amp; Roll Jeopardy!</em> used a rock and roll version, which the parent show has since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledSoundtrack">appropriated</a> for teen and college tournaments.
</li><li> The first theme on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJokersWild">The Joker's Wild</a></em> was Jean-Jacques Perrey and Gershon Kingsley's "The Savers". Among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacedTheThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacedTheThemeTune">many different theme songs</a> used after that was a re-arrangement of "The Savers" done by Hal Hidey.
</li><li> The original theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyFeud">Family Feud</a></em>. The original theme (used on the original 1976-85 series hosted by Richard Dawson) was a re-arrangement of a music bed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> with a banjo added. Then, when <em>Feud</em> was revived in 1988 with Ray Combs, the theme was remixed in stereo with the banjo taken back out and a synthesized drum added. After Combs left and Dawson returned in 1994, they switched again to a slower, jazzy version for the one season that Dawson hosted. When <em>Feud</em> returned again in 1999, it used a bland, generic "party" theme for Louie Anderson and Richard Karn's tenures; it spent the next several years alternating between the "party" theme and the Combs theme until eventually settling on the latter halfway through John O'Hurley's run.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em> always used the same melody, but performed it on different instruments with slight variations each season to reflect the change in time period.
<ul><li> <em>The Black Adder</em>, the first season, has the theme song performed mostly with trumpets and timpani in the style of a traditional Hollywood credit theme, with parody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingThemeTune">Bragging Theme Tune</a> lyrics.
</li><li> <em>Blackadder II</em> used a combination of recorder, string quartet and electric guitar. There were no lyrics at the start, but a different set of lyrics for each individual episode, commenting on the plot, was used over the closing credits.
</li><li> <em>Blackadder the Third</em>'s theme was performed on on oboe, cello and harpsichord, with no lyrics.
</li><li> The theme for <em>Blackadder Goes Forth</em> was performed by a military band, with no lyrics, combined with "The British Grenadiers".
<ul><li> The final scene featured a slow piano version of the theme played over a field of poppies.
</li></ul></li><li> The Christmas special <em>Blackadder's Christmas Carol</em> featured the song as sung by carolers, with new lyrics.
</li><li> <em>Blackadder: The Cavalier Years</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ComicRelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ComicRelief">Comic Relief</a> special, and <em>Blackadder: Back &amp; Forth</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReunionShow">Reunion Show</a>, used an orchestral version. The end credits of <em>Back &amp; Forth</em> had recapping lyrics.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening credits and main title theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> was modified between seasons 3 and 4.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> also used a slightly altered arrangement of its theme for seasons 2 and 3.
</li><li> The theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> "Where My Heart Will Take Me" went from soft rock to country in season 3. Doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealSongThemeTune">Real Song Theme Tune</a> since its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">also a cover</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RodStewart">Rod Stewart</a>'s "Faith of the Heart".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK">The Office (UK)</a></em> most weeks featured a cover version of "Handbags and Gladrags" by "Big George", except for one episode (the training day episode) where it was performed by Ricky Gervais (as David Brent) on solo acoustic guitar.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> had a new arrangement of the theme tune for each season, save for season 3 and 5, becoming increasingly intense and militaristic to match the changing tone of the series.
<ul><li> The third season's theme was harmonically similar but completely different melodically. It took cues from two pieces late in season 2, each associated with a battle scene where the good guys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">got slaughtered</a>. This season, of course, was the point in the storyline where things were the most desperate for our heroes, calling for a more turbulent mood. By the fourth season, the original melody returned as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriumphantReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TriumphantReprise">Triumphant Reprise</a>.
<ul><li> The fourth season <em>ending</em> theme, however, only lasted a few episodes. The third season ending was accidentally left in early on, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">the showrunner JMS liked it</a>. Amusingly, the season three ending itself didn't kick in for a few episodes—remembering to request it had simply fallen through the cracks.
</li></ul></li><li> In the fifth and final season, the theme song was replaced entirely with a new, rather bombastic march, possibly in reference to the fact that the station had transitioned from being a trading and diplomatic outpost to being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> capital of the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">Interstellar Alliance.</a></span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> will sometimes rearrange the theme song to fit the theme of the episode. The episode about a Spanish 'telenovella' features a mariachi version with Spanish lyrics, the episode about an Indian dancer had an Indian-style remix with lyrics in Hindi, and Boyz II Men revised the theme for the episodes featuring Gus' college a cappella group.
<ul><li> Also the first Christmas episode rearranged the theme to include bells, but the scenes in the credits were framed with snow and holly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewtonsApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewtonsApple">Newtons Apple</a></em> used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kraftwerk">Kraftwerk</a>''s "Ruckzuck" from 1983 to 1990, then used an arranged version from 1990 to 1994, before switching to a different theme entirely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam">The A-Team</a></em> used a synthesized arrangement of its theme for the final season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreeTwoOneContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreeTwoOneContact">3-2-1 Contact</a></em> remixed its opening theme in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7S537b7saE&amp;feature=related">1983<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>(the best known version), and again in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KU6pd6cxgw&amp;feature=related">1987<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1IH0dEdxL4">The original version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnTVfkc8hX4">The ending theme<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was also rearranged in 1983 (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1Vif-SNuJQ">short version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maEipkDVhsM&amp;feature=related">extended version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), and remained the same for the rest of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SquareOneTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SquareOneTV">Square One TV</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO6Tvhoolww">also did it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in its later seasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em>'s two 1980s flashback episodes had a synth version of the theme music, to go with the retro title sequence.
</li><li> A few seasons into the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">long run</a>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza">Bonanza</a></em> theme received a driving, rock-oriented rearrangement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a></em> ran for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">20 seasons</a>, and its main theme song was rearranged for the closing credits multiple times throughout the show's run. The arrangements used in the black-and-white episodes (1955-1966) are very bare bones with string lead and percussion meant to sound like horseshoes. The color episodes that are most commonly seen in reruns feature more upbeat versions of the theme over the opening and closing credits with guitar, brass, flute, and tambourine. The themes used at the very top of the show for the first 14 seasons were completely different, only alluding to the melody of the basic theme as the title card appeared.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds">Weeds</a></em>: Malvina Reynolds' "Little Boxes" is used as the theme song for the first season; for the next two seasons, each episode starts with a cover of "Little Boxes" by someone else (e.g., Elvis Costello, Regina Spektor, The Decembrists), with Reynolds' version used for the season finales. From the fourth season on, though, they dropped the theme song entirely, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it no longer fit when Nancy and family left suburbia.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em> used The Dandy Warhol's "We Used to Be Friends" for its theme. The third season, which moved from high school to college, switched to a dramatically different remix of the song - it was much slower and more electronic than indie rock. Allegedly, it was meant to have more of a noir feel to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> kept its original theme for 23 seasons, then rearranged it to a calypso version in Season 24, then to an arrangement in the spirit of the original in Season 30, a bouncy swing version in Season 33, a hip-hop-inspired version in Season 38 (which was remixed into a funk-jazz version in Season 40 with the addition of acoustic and brass instruments, and that version was remixed <em>again</em> in Season 42 by adding more percussion), and most recently a shorter folk-inspired version in Season 46 when the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">moved in first-run airings from</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS">PBS</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO">HBO</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS">PBS</a> NewsHour</em> kept the same arrangement of its theme for 30 years, before finally updating it in 2006.
</li><li> When Snoop Dogg guest-starred on an episode of Monk, the theme song became <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8u6uUsodmI">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> For the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wishbone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wishbone">Wishbone</a></em> the original theme tune was jazzed up with some electric guitar thrown in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheElectricCompany1971" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheElectricCompany1971">The Electric Company (1971)</a></em> was a rather unusual case:
<ul><li> The opening themes during the show's 1971-1977 run were used for two years each  the first from 1971-1973, the second from 1973-1975 and the third from 1975-1977.
</li><li> The <strong>closing</strong> themes changed five times, all (except the theme used very early in the run) using the main theme. They were as thus:
<ul><li> <strong>October 1971-January 1972</strong>: Extension of the main "corporate credits" theme, a nondescript theme.
</li><li> <strong>January 1972-April 1973</strong>: A bright, marching theme, with a crashing sound effect at the very end. (The corporate credits theme continued to be used until the end of the 1972-1973 season.)
</li><li> <strong>October 1973-April 1974</strong>: An electric guitar-heavy theme. The corporate credits hybrid the first half of the Friday credits during the first part and a slightly different second half, all slower paced.
</li><li> <strong>October 1974-April 1975</strong>: A bright, uptempoed jazz-inspired arrangement.
</li><li> <strong>October 1975-April 1976</strong>: Another jazz-style arrangement, somewhat louder than the 1974-75 version.
</li><li> <strong>October 1976-April 1977</strong>: A Moog synthesizer-heavy arrangement that led the acoustic instruments.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em>: For <em>35 years</em>, the CBS daytime (along with the first two syndicated versions) used the same arrangement of the theme music - in fact, the same version that was used on the first episode in September 1972 was used on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BobBarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BobBarker">Bob Barker</a>'s final show in June 2007 (although slightly sped up to give it a stereo-ish sound). Finally, in October 2007, with the coming of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrewCarey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrewCarey">Drew Carey</a>'s first shows, the main theme and most of the major cues were re-scored.
<ul><li> A 90s jazz arrangement was given to the main theme for the 1994 syndicated version of TPiR. Some thought it would carry over to the daytime version, but it didn't.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>:</em> got rearranged theme music from season 3 on, but they kept the original arrangement for the closing credits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em> had its theme rearranged for its fifth season. The fans hated it. So it switched back to the original arrangement for the very final episode.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a></em> used a late-80's styled pop/dance rendition of the show's core theme. For season 2, the show switched to its more familiar rock/metal rendition of the theme, which was further refined at the beginning of Season 4.
</li><li> For one week, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllStarBlitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllStarBlitz">All-Star Blitz</a></em> used a very <em>bizarre</em> remix of their theme with some quasi-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scatting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scatting">Scatting</a> dubbed in ("All-Star Blitz! Hobba hum, hobba heeba humba") before changing back to the original. Amusingly, the remix is the only version of the theme that circulates.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigFerguson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigFerguson">Craig Ferguson</a> made slight alterations to his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoItYourselfThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoItYourselfThemeTune">"Do It Yourself" Theme Tune</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLateLateShow">The Late Late Show</a></em> not long after its introduction, including a different vocal track and the addition of the line "You can always sleep through work tomorrow".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> had a rearranged version of its opening theme for Seasons Three, Five, Six, Seven, Nine, Ten and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>; and a rearranged version of its closing theme for Seasons Three, Six, Seven, Nine, Ten, and Eleven. Unusually for this trope, the rearrangements are subtle enough to be easily missed by casual viewers.
</li><li> Between 1994 and 1997, the theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRedGreenShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRedGreenShow">The Red Green Show</a></em> was altered to have more instrumentation, including a saxophone. This coincided with a change in the opening segment. The original theme came back.
</li><li> When ABC revived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em> in 1990, it used the 1973-82 theme rearranged with a calypso beat.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">1950s</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub">The Mickey Mouse Club</a></em> used a marching band rhythm.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHollywoodSquares">The Hollywood Squares</a></em>: The original version had a disco version of the theme in its later years, while the 1980s revival rearranged its 80's sax theme in the final season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnotsLanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnotsLanding">Knots Landing</a></em> featured a different arrangement of its theme song for each of its 14 seasons, including several complete overhauls of the melody's structure and instrumentation. For example, the first season theme was disco-flavored and brassy; nearly a decade later, the theme was much slower and layered with strings.
</li><li> Many long-running American daytime soap operas have kept the same melody for many years, updating and rearranging frequently. Some notable examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em>: the 1990-1994 theme returned in 2002 with a new sound (further rearranged in 2004).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a></em>: went from the string orchestra original to a more electronic version in 1993.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight">Guiding Light</a></em>: from 1983 to 1990, there were no less than five different variations on the same theme
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungAndTheRestless">The Young and the Restless</a></em>: switched from the original piano/strings arrangement to a jazzier arrangement with saxophone and percussion in 1999 (switching back in 2003).
</li><li> Many soaps using theme songs played on organ in the early 1970s switched to orchestrated versions of these themes, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEdgeOfNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEdgeOfNight">The Edge of Night</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> attempted this in the Season Three opener "The Note." The classic slap bass theme was given background singers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1fitp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1fitp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1fitp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Julia Louis Dreyfus once joked that they were singing "easy to beat" due to the show's incredibly poor ratings at the time</span>. Unfortunately, this experiment was deemed a failure. So, in the following episode, the instrumental versions of the show's theme and transitional tunes returned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ClassicAlbums" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ClassicAlbums">Classic Albums</a></em>: The record producers, studio engineers and the artist himself often take the original studio tracks from the album and let the audience listen to demo versions, outtakes, acoustic performances, the vocal parts only, guitar and bass part only, lead vocals only...
</li><li> Each season of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> are different. starting with Season 2, They dropped the part where Kermit the Frog sings <em>To Introduce the guest star...</em> part. And also, Gonzo no longer hits the gong, He now blows his trumpet.
<ul><li> When Season 3 came, They added the audience chanting <em>Why don't you get things started?</em>
</li><li> During season 4, It was shorted with male and female singing <em>It's time to play the music, It's time to light the lights, It's time to get things started.</em>
</li><li> Season 5 (The final season) had the full theme song. With Statler and Waldorf ranting <em>Why do we always come here, I guess we'll never know, It's kinda like a torture, To have to watch the show!</em>
</li></ul></li><li> The theme music for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> appears to have been re-recorded at least twice over the eight seasons. This is fairly subtle and not immediately apparent to the ear; the biggest single reason was apparently to correct an error in the sung lyric that made the Universe fourteen <em>million</em> years old, as opposed to the more correct fourteen <em>billion</em>.
<ul><li> In October 2016, astrophysicists believe the furthest object from the Earth is <em>thirty-two</em> billion light years away, suggesting the Big Bang occured 32 billion years ago. At least. So is another revision likely?
<ul><li> No; because of the expansion of the universe over time increasing the amount of space it had to travel through, the light from that object traveled 32 billion light years in 14 billion years of time.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "The Hockey Theme", the "classic" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HockeyNightInCanada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HockeyNightInCanada">Hockey Night in Canada</a>/</em>La Soirée du hockey'' theme, had been re-arranged five times before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBC">CBC</a>/Radio-Canada lost the rights, and TSN/RDS had to make another arrangement upon gaining the theme's rights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney &amp; Friends</a></em>' theme song has been done multiple times with different child singers, with the most recent one being a shortened hip-hop version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSecretLifeOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSecretLifeOfUs">The Secret Life of Us</a></em> uses an edited version of "Death Defy" by Motor Ace. The season four credits slightly changed the arrangement, with the opening lines changed from the first half of the first verse to the second half:
<ul><li> Season 1-3: "Starting to get my head in your space,/Starting to lose track of the weekdays,/Starting to cook my brain in five ways/Trying to be cool."
</li><li> Season 4: "Starting to lose my inhibitions,/Starting to make some bad decisions,/I'm listening to all your crap opinions,/Trying to be cool."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outlander">Outlander</a></em> has adjusted its theme music several times to reflect the different settings of each season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UniversityChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UniversityChallenge">University Challenge</a></em> had an upbeat jazz arrangement of its theme tune for most of its history. Sometime around 2000, it was replaced with a string quartet version which survives to this day.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>, the brief snippet of theme music that's played leading out of the opening teaser of each episode was given a subtle, slightly more jazzy rearrangement for the episodes that came <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after Patrick Jane killed Red John.</span>
</li><li> The famous theme song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CandidCamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CandidCamera">Candid Camera</a></em> had a different arrangement with each new version of the program.

<ul><li> With the introduction of stereophonic recording in the late 1950s, many country and pop music performers began re-recording many of their early hits, especially those that were popular in the 1930s through early 1950s timeframe. Notable examples include:
<ul><li> Ernest Tubb's "Walking the Floor Over You"; for years, his stereo version, recorded in January 1963, was preferred by music directors to the 1941 original.
</li><li> Kitty Wells, in particular her 1952 breakthrough "It Wasn't God Who Made Honky-Tonk Angels." The stereo version, a Nashville Sound-esque arrangement recorded in 1963, would for many years take the place of the honky-tonk styled original.
</li><li> Patsy Cline's breakthrough hit "Walkin' After Midnight." The original hit version from 1957 had a 4/4-waltz shuffle, with elements of jazz, blues and pop of the era. In 1961, shortly after she hit with "I Fall to Pieces," Cline recorded a new stereo version, which was noticeably more uptempo and had a big-band "pop" arrangement, featuring backing vocals and a pronounced "clip clop" percussion effect. Many music and program directors soon preferred the new version.
</li><li> Lefty Frizzell, who in 1950 and 1951 had a series of legendary, genre-defining hits, including "Always Late With Your Kisses," "If You've Got the Money, I've Got the Time," "I Love You a Thousand Ways," "Mom and Dad's Walz" and "I Want to Be With You Always." Those were among a series of songs he re-recorded in December 1958, shortly after the introduction of stereo and all with backing vocals and new instrumentation.
</li><li> Red Foley, a prominent artist of the 1940s and early 1950s who combined elements of boogie, swing and R&amp;B with country music, re-recorded many of his biggest hits  including his two No. 1 hits of 1950, "Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy" and "M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I"  in 1963. These Owen Bradley-produced versions soon replaced the original non-stereo versions in many record libraries.
</li><li> Sonny James has done this several times as well, most notably with:
<ul><li> His 1957 hit "Young Love." At least three re-recordings were made between 1962 and 1970, and it was often the 1970 version, recorded in a lower key than the original hit version, that was preferred by music programmers for a time.
</li><li> In 1971, when he announced he was in the midst of leaving Capitol Records for the CBS family of labels, he recorded a new version of the flip side of "Young Love," called "You're the Reason I'm In Love," this time in a brighter, horn-heavy arrangement. When it came time to release the song in the spring of 1972, James even gave the song a new name to go along with the new arrangement: "That's Why I Love You Like I Do." The original "You're the Reason ..." charted and went to No. 6 in early 1957, but "That's Why I Love You ... " did even better, going to No. 1 on the country chart.
</li></ul></li><li> Webb Pierce recorded most of his early 1950s hits in late 1963 and early 1964, most notably a Nashville Sound-esque "There Stands the Glass." That was his second go-round with some of his hits; in 1960, he re-recorded his biggest hit, "In the Jailhouse Now," for a new album called <em>Webb With a Beat</em>, and this rockabilly version (in stereo, natch) soon replaced the original 1955 honky-tonk version that was for years one of just three songs to top the country chart for 21 weeks. (Incidentally, Pierce's 1955 hit version was at least the second time he re-recorded the song; the 1951 original failed to become a hit, while his second recording, recorded less than two months before the hit version, was never issued as a single.)
</li><li> Hank Thompson: Among his several re-recordings of his 1952 "The Wild Side of Life" was the 1962 stereo version, done in the Nashville Sound-arrangement with backing vocals, that was preferred for many years by music directors.
</li><li> Hank Snow re-recorded several of his late 1940s/early 1950s singles in stereo, including his biggest hit "I'm Moving On" (complete with a more upbeat arrangement and backing vocals). For a time, the new stereo version was the most popular before reverting back to the original 12-bar blues version.
</li><li> Eddy Arnold has done this on many occasions through the years. Examples:
<ul><li> He recorded no less than four notable, distinctive versions of "Cattle Call." The first was recorded in 1944 and released as a (non-charting) single in the spring of 1945, done in the typical 1940s Western style of the genre. His first re-recording, from 1955, was done in an orchestra pop style, becoming a No. 1 hit late that summer. The first stereo version was recorded in 1961 and although not issued as a single, this acoustic guitar-prominent rendition became the version by far most familiar to country radio audiences of the mid-1960s onward, again as radio programmers were phasing out their older, non-stereo library for new stereo re-recordings by the same artists. Finally a third re-recording featured Arnold as guest vocalist on a new pop-country version by teen superstar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeAnnRimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeAnnRimes">LeAnn Rimes</a>; Rimes' version was recorded in 1999 and became a minor hit late that fall. (Additionally, Arnold recorded the song twice more, the first in 1949 and yet another re-recording in 1973 (so that his then-new label, MGM Records, could cash in.) Not bad for what was essentially a cover version of a Tex Owens cowboy tune recorded more than a decade before the Tennessee Plowboy's first version.
</li><li> One of his best-selling albums was his 1960 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits">Greatest Hits</a> album "Eddy Arnold Sings Them Again," containing 12 of his biggest hits from the late 1940s through mid-1950s: "Bouquet Of Roses," "Molly Darling," "The Lovebug Itch," "I'll Hold You In My Heart (Till I Can Hold You In My Arms)," "I Wanna Play House With You," "It's A Sin," "Anytime," "I Walk Alone," "You Don't Know Me," "A Heart Full Of Love (For a Handful of Kisses)," "I Really Don't Want To Know" and "Texarkana Baby." Each of these songs were done in the then-prevalent Nashville Sound style, complete with strings and backing vocalists.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams">Hank Williams</a> also has been given this treatment. Thirteen years after his death, MGM Records issued an album called <em>The Legend Lives Anew</em>, with new instrumental arrangements, overdubs, backing vocals and so forth on 12 of his legendary hits. In other words, what would Hank Sr. have sounded like had he lived and was still recording in the mid-1960s — he would have been 43 years old in 1966, the year the album was issued — and perhaps having adopted the then-prevalent Nashville Sound. Critics didn't really take to it, and while there surely were new Hank Sr. fans as a result of this album, most preferred his original 78s ... and most country music radio station music libraries of the era kept the original versions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimmieRodgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimmieRodgers">Jimmie Rodgers</a>: In the mid-1950s, several of his original recordings were given new backing arrangements to update the sound, from late 1920s/early 1930s to a mid-1950s honky-tonk arrangement. Based on the success of Webb Pierce's "In the Jailhouse Now," RCA Records in 1955 released a "new" version of Rodgers' "In the Jailhouse Now" (an update of the original 1928 recording, with Hank Snow and his backing band, the Rainbow Ranch Boys, recording a new instrumental track), and it reached No. 7 on the <em>Billboard</em> country charts.
</li><li> Leroy Van Dyke's first hit, 1957's "Auctioneer," began as a simple three-instrument song: a couple of guitars and drum. Later versions are more uptempo and have more instrumentation, and at least one other has two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruckDriversGearChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruckDriversGearChange">Truck Driver's Gear Changes</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a> has done this with several of his songs, with some of the re-recordings becoming the hit version:
<ul><li> "Me and Paul," a tribute to his friendship and collaborations with drummer Paul English, was originally recorded and released on an album in 1971, during his days with RCA Records. The original was the B-side of the song "(A Taste Of) Yesterday's Wine," (years later, a duet No. 1 hit by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerleHaggard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerleHaggard">Merle Haggard</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones">George Jones</a>). A more uptempo version was recorded in 1985 for the album of the same name ... and that version was released as a single in the fall of 1985, reaching the top 15.
</li><li> "Bloody Mary Morning," originally recorded in 1970 for his album <em>Both Sides Now</em>. Much more uptempo than the original  the context was now a man who is left by his wife  the 1974 version (for his album <em>Phases and Stages</em>) became a top-20 hit.
</li><li> "Whiskey River," a track on his landmark 1973 album <em>Shotgun Willie</em>. A re-recording of the song, done in concert, became a huge hit in 1979 and was included on his album <em>Willie and Family Live</em>.
</li><li> "Pretty Paper," the Christmas song discussed below.
</li></ul></li><li> Tommy Edwards intially recorded "It's All in the Game", "Please Mr. Sun" and "The Morning Side of the Mountain" in 1951 with slow string-heavy arrangements and they proved decent hits. He remade "It's All in the Game" in 1958 with a "rock and roll" arrangement and got a #1 hit in the U.S (one of the earliest on the modern <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 chart) and the U.K. Similar updated remakes of "Please Mr. Sun" and "The Morning Side of the Mountain" were recorded and released on the same single in 1959, with the former reaching #11 on the Hot 100.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NatKingCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NatKingCole">Nat King Cole</a>:
<ul><li> He released <em>The Nat King Cole Story</em> in 1961, a retrospective of his career which featured stereo remakes of his Trio and solo recordings, though a few of the songs were recent enough that they were already in stereo to begin with and were thus included as-is. (Strangely enough, "Non Dimenticar", which was extant in stereo, was remade regardless.) This is where his fourth version of "The Christmas Song" (see below) debuted; it was later included in its own album, which was actually a repackaged reissue of <em>The Magic of Christmas</em>, plus this song and minus "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen".
</li><li> In the years following his untimely passing in 1965, Capitol released several albums of various released and unreleased material with instrumental overdubs meant to update the songs to mid-1960s standards. Like the similar Hank Williams experiment, critical response was tepid and most Cole fans only bother with them for completeness, morbid curiosity and/or to get otherwise unavailable tracks.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> remade six of the eight songs on his 1950 Columbia album <em>Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra</em> for his 1961 Capitol album <em>Sinatra's Swingin Session!</em> with new stereo arrangements. He also remade songs he recorded with Tommy Dorsey with new arrangements by Dorsey arranger Sy Oliver for his 1961 Reprise album <em>I Remember Tommy</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> More recently, with the advent of budget-priced compilation albums, recording artists  way too many to mention  have been asked to re-record some of their biggest hits for these new various artists albums, including some whose songs were released as late as the 1990s. The quality of these compilations has varied greatly from excellent (and sometimes even surpassing the originals) to subpar.
</li><li> Christmas songs:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NatKingCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NatKingCole">Nat King Cole</a>'s seminal version of "The Christmas Song." Four versions of the song exist: the first 1946 recording which only featured the Trio and was not issued until it was accidentally included in a various artists compilation in 1989, the second 1946 recording which featured the Trio augmented with a string quartet and a harp, a 1953 recording with full orchestra and the most familiar by far 1961 stereo recording with an almost identical full orchestra arrangement. Aside from the stereo sound, the 1961 version can be told apart from the 1953 version by Cole's voice being much deeper and more focused than on the earlier take.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a>'s version of "Pretty Paper." The original downbeat, bluesy version was recorded in 1964, when he was with RCA Records. While that version still gets some airplay, the most familiar version by far — recorded in 1979 for his Christmas album — had his signature sound of the 1970s and 1980s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeneAutry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeneAutry">Gene Autry</a> recorded new stereo versions of two of his most famous songs — "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and "Here Comes Santa Claus" in 1957. Of "Rudolph ...," both the new version and the original 1949 mono record are still played today; "Here Comes Santa Claus," almost all music directors stuck with the 1947 original.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a> has become probably the most notorious example in modern pop music, frequently playing live versions of his old songs that sound very different to the original recordings, or previous live reworkings. Fans are divided on whether this is a self-indulgent "fuck you" to fans, or a sign of his artistic genius.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a> rearranged "Watching the Detectives" to an Orchestral Big Band number out of the 1950s.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings">Paul McCartney</a> has done this repeatedly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> on. His album <em>Wingspan</em> has two different mixes of "No More Lonely Nights" on it, and he once released a classical album in which half the pieces were reworkings of lesser-known songs of his. Then there are the concert versions of "Maybe I'm Amazed" (which is usually as good as the original from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/McCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/McCartney">McCartney</a></em>), "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"—though he probably borrowed that one from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>—and the "Carry That Weight {You Never Give Me Your Money)" mix. (Two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Beatlesongs</a> he wrote most of, with one major melody in common...)
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> wrote "One After 909" in 1962 and recorded it with the Beatles with a skiffle beat. It didn't get heard until 1995 on volume one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatlesAnthology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatlesAnthology">The Beatles Anthology</a></em> package. The version that <em>did</em> get released was on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetItBe">Let It Be</a></em> album. It had a different tempo to it but the structure was the same.
</li><li> McCartney wrote "Come And Get It" for Badfinger—it was written for the movie <em>The Magic Christian</em> and was released as a single on the Beatles' Apple label. McCartney recorded it as a guide for Badfinger with a slower tempo and slightly higher pitch than what Badfinger would eventually do. This appeared on volume three of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatlesAnthology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatlesAnthology">The Beatles Anthology</a></em>.
</li><li> A downplayed case happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' very first single, "Love Me Do". George Martin didn't like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a>'s drumming, so he scheduled a re-recording with a session drummer - this version is easy to notice because Ringo plays a tambourine to still be in the track.
</li></ul></li><li> Post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualKei">Visual Kei</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DirEnGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DirEnGrey">Dir en grey</a> has rearranged and rereleased <strong>a lot</strong> of their old material. Most of them are remastered versions of old songs ("-Zan-", "Rasetsukoku", some songs from the original version of <em>UROBOROS</em>), but many songs have been <em>completely rewritten</em> in an entirely different style.
</li><li> Miyuki Nakajima redoes her songs for her <em>Yakai</em> stage shows, sometimes even completely and <em>literally</em> rearranging them, as with the song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADwr63E9r4Y&amp;feature=related">Kodoku no Shouzo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>." (The original can be heard <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np-xT3StTdM">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a> has done a soulful, unplugged version of his own song, "Layla." <a class="urllink" href="http://retrocrush.buzznet.com/archive2007/badcovers/part3.html">Opinions vary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a> released a 1985 remix of "Don't Stand So Close To Me", featuring a more electronic-based arrangement and a somewhat different chorus melody. It, along with an unreleased version of "De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da", were done like that because Stewart Copeland had broken his collarbone and couldn't drum, so he did it all electronically - and the arguments with him and Sting about which synth to use were so aggressive that they served as the last straw to break up the band.
<ul><li> Sting did a piano and voice version of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Roxanne</a>" for the Live Aid show.
</li><li> Sting also re-recorded his 1996 hit "I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying" with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyKeith">Toby Keith</a> a year later, because Keith had wanted to cover it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicOfThe1960s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicOfThe1960s">Sixties</a> bands loved turning old blues songs into insane rock-outs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> are probably most famous for it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth">Megadeth</a> was infamous for this during the '80s. Their first three albums all had covers, the first two being chosen especially to be as far as possible from Megadeth's patented "speed metal" sound; "These Boots Were Made For Walking", a pop song, and "I Ain't Superstitious", a blues song. Their cover of "These Boots" especially, which humorously altered the lyrics to make them more blatantly sexual, drew the ire of the song's original writer, who demanded that they rerelease said album without the offending track.
<ul><li> These songs were well received, but when they did a played straight version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a>' "Anarchy In The UK", where Mustaine threw in his own 'edgy' lyrics because he forgot the originals, it was badly received.
</li><li> Mustaine has also done this with his own songs, notably "A Tout La Monde" which was rearranged with Cristina Scabbia singing guest vocals. The reaction to this was mixed. It attracted a lot of new fans, but many older fans were annoyed because they felt the rerecorded version would overshadow the original (and for a brief period, they were right).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a> was infamous for rearranging their own songs, numerous times. In particular, they re-recorded "Temptation" and "Confusion" (two non-album singles that were the band's first major hits) for the 1987 compilation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SubstanceNewOrderAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SubstanceNewOrderAlbum">Substance</a></em>, leaving the original versions of the songs the unavailable on CD for years until <em>Singles</em> was released in 2005. They also remade their hit song "Blue Monday" in 1988, shortening the song down to 4 minutes in order to get the seven minute long song played on the radio as well.
<ul><li> They played a pretty awesome drum'n'bass inflected update of their 1980 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision">Joy Division</a> song 'Isolation' at the 1998 Reading festival and it's on a John Peel session recording.
</li><li> Similarly, Paul Hardcastle's singles "19" and "Rain Forest" were re-recorded for his self-titled album, and for many years, these were the only versions available on CD.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a>:
<ul><li> They rerecorded their early single "West End Girls" for their first album <em>Please</em>.
</li><li> They turned their bombastic synthpop song "Can You Forgive Her?" into an early-'40s <em>big band</em> arrangement, complete with chilled-out, breathy vocals, for the B-side of the single.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s <em>Thriller 25</em>, with 2008 versions of <em>Beat It</em>, <em>P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)</em>, <em>Billie Jean</em>, <em>The Girl is Mine</em> and <em>Wanna Be Startin' Something</em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Thriller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Thriller">Thriller</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer">MC Hammer</a> has two versions of "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_the_Way_We_Roll">This Is The Way We Roll<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" on his "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Legit_to_Quit">2 Legit To Quit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" album: a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15gx-_SAnnw">lively fast-paced version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with back-up singers and a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpz34gY9x6k">slower "OakTown" version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> Mike Oldfield has released at least four different versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TubularBells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TubularBells">Tubular Bells</a></em>, each slightly different to the one before.
</li><li> Bon Voyage (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starflyer59" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starflyer59">Starflyer 59</a> side project) featured two different versions of a song on the same album, <em>Lies</em> (and not even as a bonus track, either). "Monster" is the original, and "Bad Dream" is the same lyrics with the backing music chopped into tiny pieces and rearranged.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WovenHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WovenHand">Woven Hand</a> has made two soundtrack albums, <em>Blush Music</em> and <em>Puur</em>, which feature rearrangements of prior songs (usually to make the songs longer).
</li><li> The <em>Split Enz</em> tribute album "eNZso" features old hits retooled into orchestral versions performed by various vocalists and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.
</li><li> Used liberally in Irish rock band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaelicStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GaelicStorm">Gaelic Storm</a>'s stage shows where they'll announce that one of their shows has been picked up by &lt;insert famous singer&gt; and then performing the song in the given style of the artist.
</li><li> Shudder To Think's Craig Wedren apparently likes doing this with his song "Day Ditty": Shudder To Think first recorded it as a 2 minute minimal ballad on <em>Funeral At The Movies</em>, then it later reappeared on the <em>First Love Last Rites</em> soundtrack as a fairly lavish 4 minute Phil Spector homage, with Angela McCluskey on guest vocals. And then Wedren's more electronic-based project BABY retitled it "Leaving Day Ditty" and gave it more of a trip-hop feel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KylieMinogue">Kylie Minogue</a> has done this a lot. She has remade various songs into ballads, jazz, and electronica.

</li><li> Ayla's self titled single, originally released in 1996, was rearranged by DJ Taucher(Ralph Armand Beck) in 1997, so much that it sounded nothing like the original, which promptly faded into obscurity. In turn, DJ Tandu (another alias of Ingo Kunzi, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">main man</a> behind Ayla) did a rearrangement based on Taucher's version in 1999, then that version itself was covered by Kosmonova.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a> has done this with "Morning Bell" (rearranged on their next album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Amnesiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Amnesiac">Amnesiac</a></em>, as (appropriately enough) "Morning Bell/Amnesiac") and the b-side "Fog" (a live piano version titled "Fog (Again)").
</li><li> The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKLF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKLF">The KLF</a> are credited with pioneering a new approach to song mixing. They would continually tweak, remix, and rerelease their material, with no version being the definitive one. Engineer Mark Stent told <em>Sound on Sound</em> magazine:
<div class="indent">It was in working with Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty that things really started to happen in a new way, using mixing as a work-in-progress, rather than an end stage. We were running everything live in the studio, from sequencers and samplers. Obviously there was also stuff on tape, but they would come in with their Ataris and Akai samplers, and we would end up rearranging the whole song whilst mixing things. They would then take away what we did, work on it again, and come back a while later, and I'd mix stuff again. My KLF work put me in the picture, and after that the phone never stopped ringing.
</div><ul><li> Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> "What Time Is Love?" went through numerous permutations. First it was an instrumental acid house song in 1988. In 1990, the "Live at Trancentral" mix transformed it into stadium house, cranking up the volume and adding rap vocals. (A shortened version of this mix appeared on their 1991 album <em>The White Room</em>.) In 1991, it gained glam rock vocals and guitars to become "America (What Time is Love)". Then, for KLF's 1997 reunion show (under the name 2K), they remixed it yet again as "Fuck the Millenium", adding a brass band, a harder techno beat, angry chanting, samples from nearly all of KLF's prior singles, and a church hymn as an interlude. And that's not even counting all the "What Time Is Love?" remixes by other artists that appeared as KLF b-sides...
</li></ul></li><li> Chiodos did two different rearrangements of the demo "Thermacare" (recorded with old vocalist Craig Owens). After the band's split, Chiodos recorded a different version of the song with different lyrics, "Stratovolcano Mouth" featuring new vocalist Brandon Bolmer, whereas Owens recorded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledLyrics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledLyrics">a new song over Thermacare's lyrics</a>, "The Only Thing You Talk About".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>:
<ul><li> He has done this on his live shows on occasion. His live version of "Atlantic City" more fully incorporates the E Street Band(the original version from the album "Nebraska" was just him on guitar and harmonica).
</li><li> "Born in the U.S.A." was originally written with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UBei3n4FOY">a more somber sound<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and a darker melody in mind, a sparse number featuring just himself, acoustic guitar, and, toward the end, a simple electric guitar part and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanWail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWomanWail">One-Woman Wail</a>. This iteration of the song, intended for <em>Nebraska</em>, would not see the light of day until the <em>Tracks</em> outtake compilation, shelved in favor of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">the more bombastic, cheery-sounding, synth-laden version</a> on <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em>
</li><li> While touring with the Sessions Band (the band with which he recorded <em>We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions</em>), he re-arranged "If I Should Fall Behind" as a waltz.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents">The Residents</a> had a tradition of revamping their first official single "Santa Dog" every four years, with the purpose of demonstrating their musical development and the new technology available to them since then. Among the most dramatically changed versions were "Where Are Your Dogs? Show Us Your Ugly", which added a lot more lyrics and stretched the originally under 2 minute song to almost 13 minutes, and the self-explanatory "Santa Dog for <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan">Gamelan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Orchestra".

Both ended up on the soundtrack, with the second version being dubbed "Blister 2000".
</li><li> When "No Rain" became Blind Melon's biggest hit and they started getting bored of playing it at every show, they started playing a much slower, psychedelic blues version of the song, which arguably fit its lyrics about depression <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">better than the relaxed folk-rock of the original</a>.

That famous melody that everyone knows? Probably not the original melody the hymn was first sung with. Modern Christian artists have taken to reusing the lyrics and adding new choruses to them. For example, Chris Tomlin's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-4NFvI5U9w">Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Many of J.S. Bach's sacred cantatas include movements based on Lutheran hymns, or chorales, of the time. The most famous is <em>Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott</em> (BWV 80), which utilizes the melody of Martin Luther's hymn of the same name in almost all of the movements. Bach also appropriated the chorale melodies for his chorale preludes.

The song with the most pronounced difference may be "Revolve" - the original was a fairly accessible straightforward hard rock song, whereas the <em>Electroretard</em> version removes the driving rhythm, replaces the distorted guitar tone with a strange phasing effect, adds some atonal high-pitched synthesizers, and omits the chorus entirely.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrokenSocialScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrokenSocialScene">Broken Social Scene</a> released an alternate version of "Lover's Spit" as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide">B-Side</a> (as later collected on the compilation <em>Bee Hives</em>): It's a longer, more stripped down take on the song, but more notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Feist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Feist">Feist</a> sings lead vocals instead of Kevin Drew.
</li><li> Der Dritte Raum, a German techno duo, remade their classic trance track "Hale Bopp" as a jazz house tune titled "Swing Bop", featured on their 2010 album <em>Rosa Rausch</em>.

A couple of years later, they re-recorded it for <em>Neon Ballroom</em> as "Spawn Again" - the drum machine and industrial effects Vitro added to the song were removed, putting more emphasis on the guitars, the introduction was entirely different, and the vocals became more aggressive.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>:
<ul><li> Bach occasionally turned his concertos in a variety of different instruments into harpsichord concertos. Quite a few of these harpsichord concertos are the only existing versions of now-lost concertos for other instruments.
</li><li> Bach also rearranged several violin concertos by Vivaldi into harpsichord concertos. Perhaps the most insane example is Bach's arrangement of Vivaldi's Concerto No. 10 in B minor for four violins, cello and strings (RV 580) into the Concerto for <em>four harpsichords</em> and strings (BWV 1065).
</li><li> Bach is also famous (or infamous, depending on who you ask) for using themes from earlier works in later pieces, a technique called "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody_music">parody<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".

Much of it was reworked into the first movement of the secular cantata <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzFCC9GVdxw">Auf, schmetternde Töne der muntern Trompeten<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (Arise, blaring tones of high-spirited trumpets). In fact, the cantata is almost literally the Brandenburg Concerto No. 1 with lyrics!
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban">Keith Urban</a> has done this twice: first, in 2001, he re-recorded "Where the Blacktop Ends" for the single release, and in 2008, he re-recorded "You Look Good in My Shirt" (an album cut from 2002's <em>Golden Road</em>) and released the re-recording as a single from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum">Greatest Hits Album</a>.
</li><li> Jeff Bates re-recorded "Long, Slow Kisses", a track from his first album, and issued the re-recording as a single from his second album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JakeOwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JakeOwen">Jake Owen</a> did the same with "Eight Second Ride": he recorded it on his first album, re-recorded it for the second album, and made the re-recording the second single from said album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeDiffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoeDiffie">Joe Diffie</a> completely re-recorded "John Deere Green" for the single release, giving it a "cleaner" instrumentation and slightly different vocal track while cutting down on some of the repeated lines. "Third Rock from the Sun" was also changed drastically for the radio edit: it omitted the digitized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalColdOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalColdOpen">Lyrical Cold Open</a> while also toning down the vocal reverb and removing a couple instrument tracks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw">Tim McGraw</a>:
<ul><li> Tim McGraw re-recorded the vocal track for the radio version of "She Never Lets It Go to Her Heart", which also had the huge wall of backing vocals toned down on the chorus.
</li><li> Much later, he sent an alternate mix of "Lookin' for That Girl" to radio which greatly reduced the amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoTune">Auto-Tune</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Tracy Byrd re-recorded "The Keeper of the Stars" for the single version. The re-recording, which is a half-step lower than the album version (also how he sings it in concert), was also used in the music video.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AfroCeltSoundSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AfroCeltSoundSystem">Afro Celt Sound System</a> has released several remixed versions (or just edited-for radio versions) of their songs (some remixed by other musicians, some remixed by themselves), generally as b-sides on singles. Their most dramatically changed song was possibly "Release": the original was a moody Celtic song over African percussion; Rollo &amp; Sister Bliss remixed it into a clubby trance song, while Bi-Polar remixed it into a jazzy ska song. The remix album <em>Pod</em> collects ACSS's favorite of these remixes, and adds a number of completely new mixes (with new instrumental parts recorded specifically for that album). And the albums <em>Release</em> and <em>Seed</em> both conclude with an instrumental remix of a vocal track.
</li><li> In the mid-late 2000s, it's become a bit of a trend for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singers to do alternate, acoustic versions of their hits. Most of the time, they're bonus tracks on the album, or used for alternate versions of the corresponding music video. Other times, they're only available as downloads from either iTunes or the singer's website.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithHill">Faith Hill</a>:
<ul><li> For no particular reason, Faith Hill re-recorded her 1996 single "You Can't Lose Me" exclusively for the video.
</li><li> Much later, she rerecorded "The Way You Love Me" for pop radio with a heavier pop beat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoTune">Auto-Tuned</a> backing vocals.
</li></ul></li><li> On his 1984 album <em>He Thinks He's Ray Stevens</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayStevens">Ray Stevens</a> re-recorded his 1962 single "Furthermore", changing from the goofy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a> inflections and muted trumpets of the 1960s to a more subdued country waltz. He also changed some of the lyrics, most notably the final verse, which was no longer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">identical to the first</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilSedaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilSedaka">Neil Sedaka</a>'s first version of "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">fast and upbeat</a>. The re-released version is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SofterAndSlowerCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SofterAndSlowerCover">Softer and Slower Cover</a>.
</li><li> In 2012, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton">Blake Shelton</a> asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBuble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelBuble">Michael Bublé</a>, whose "Home" he covered in 2008, to do a Christmas-themed rewrite of "Home". Bublé obliged, and sang it with Blake on the latter's Christmas album <em>Cheers, It's Christmas</em>.
</li><li> Machinae Supremacy recorded a cover of Britney Spears's "Gimme More" in their usual SiD-metal format.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliamsJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliamsJr">Hank Williams Jr.</a> re-wrote his 1982 hit "A Country Boy Can Survive" with Y2K-themed lyrics in late 1999. He gave it to Chad Brock, who sang it with guest vocals from Williams, John Anderson (whose part was cut from the radio edit), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones">George Jones</a>. Williams re-recorded it again after 9/11 with patriotic lyrics under the title "America Will Survive".
</li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ZacBrownBand">Zac Brown Band</a>'s singles were re-recorded for radio: "Chicken Fried", "Toes", and "All Alright" had solos abridged (and the former also had some organ notes dubbed in near the end). "Beautiful Drug" got an alternate mix that lessened the polarizing EDM/folktronica sound, and "Castaway" had the fadeout moved to the opening while toning down the bridge a bit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloridaGeorgiaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloridaGeorgiaLine">Florida Georgia Line</a> remixed "Cruise" for pop radio with a heavy dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoTune">Auto-Tune</a> and a guest verse from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nelly">Nelly</a>.
</li><li> The Frozen Autumn re-recorded their 1995 song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZefvDUblpc">"Wait For Nothing"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3Wn78a_v5s">in 2010 with Arianna(Froxeanne) on vocals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Previously, in 1999, they produced a futurepop remix of "This Time", released on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> of <em>Pale Awakening</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MaryLambert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MaryLambert">Mary Lambert</a>'s "She Keeps Me Warm" is basically to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Macklemore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Macklemore">Macklemore</a>'s "Same Love" what Alicia Keys' ""Empire State of Mind II" is to Jay-Z's "Empire State Of Mind": A singer expanding their guest appearance on a rap song into a song of their own. After "Same Love" became a hit, Macklemore fans started coming to her shows, so she decided to make her own version of the song so that she could play something they'd recognize.
</li><li> Countless songs that have been hits in more than one genre are usually remixed for the other genre. For instance, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> songs have different mixes for country and pop, with the country mix usually being the one present on the album. Inverted with "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", where the pop mix is the one present on the album, and the country mix being much harder to find.
</li><li> Kristin Hersh's 1994 version of Your Ghost was mainly based around her vocals and acoustic guitar playing - the only other instrumentation on the song was cello, guest backing vocals by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">Michael Stipe</a>, and very minimal percussion. In 2004, she re-recorded it with her band 50 Foot Wave, using a louder, distorted-guitar-based arrangement that brought it at least a couple notches up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfRockAndMetalHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfRockAndMetalHardness">Mohs Scale of Rock and Metal Hardness</a> (from a one to around a three or four).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject">Morning Musume</a> album <em>The Best! ~Updated Morning Musume~</em> is entirely devoted to this.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2mlu2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2mlu2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2mlu2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">with the exceptions of "Wagamama Ki no Mama Ai no Joke", which was the most recent single at the time of release, and "Wolf Boy", a completely new song.</span> For instance, the bubbly, upbeat "I WISH" is reworked into a mellower tune, while "Aruiteru" goes in the opposite direction (for better or for worse.)
</li><li> Midnight Resistance reworked <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHtoK_GR6HE">"Second Skin"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, originally released in 2008, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U0Hz6UIDOg">for his 2012 second album<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Markus "Captain" Kaarlonen remade his 1991 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MOD">MOD</a> track "Space Debris" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">Laserdance-style</a> for the 2011 platform game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rochard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rochard">Rochard</a></em>.
</li><li> Steven Stapleton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NurseWithWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NurseWithWound">Nurse with Wound</a> has a habit of resampling and re-arranging his work so often that what sounds like the same song can get released several times over a few years:
<ul><li> "Nylon Coverin' Body Smotherin'" and "Brained by falling masonry" are nearly identical and came out within months of each other.
</li><li> "Registered Nurse" was re-arranged and re-released as "Registered Nurse (Second Coming)." Ditto with "Automating" and "Automating (again)".
</li><li> "A short dip in the glory hole", "Brained"'s b-side, has seen a few edits.
</li><li> The songs from <em>Gyllensköld, Geijerstam, and I at Rydbergs</em> were re-arranged for inclusion on <em>Large Ladies with Cake in the Oven</em>.
</li><li> <em>A Sucked Orange</em> and <em>Scrag</em> were assembled from the same master tapes. Several pieces appear in both but are blended in a different way on each one.
</li><li> The album <em>Thunder Perfect Mind</em> consists of two songs. "Cold" was re-edited several times, including for a single release as "Steel Dream March of the Metal Men". The beat midway through "Colder Still" resurfaced many times, including "Two Golden Microphones" from <em>Rock'n Roll Station</em> and half of the album <em>Who Can I Turn to Stereo</em>, amongst other places. Both songs appear in snippets throughout <em>Rat Tapes One</em>.
</li><li> "Salt" gained additional samples of machinery and talking to become "Salt Marie Celeste". The piece would later be blended with <em>Echo Poeme</em> to become "Soundpooling #3".
</li><li> Four whole albums revolved around the concept: <em>Angry Eelectric Finger</em> was issued in a "Raw Mix" form alongside three re-interpretations by friends of Stapleton: Jim O'Rourke, Cyclobe and irr. app. (ext.) Surprisingly, O'Rourke and irr. app.(ext.)'s versions sounded eerily similar, despite not hearing each other's work until they were finalized. The source material itself had similarities to "Salt".
</li><li> A few pieces were edited from their transition from vinyl to cassette to CD over the years. The cassette version of "Great Balls of Fur", for example, contained an intro sampling a Johnson's Baby Lotion ad which didn't make it to vinyl or later CD pressings of the album it was from.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShaniaTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ShaniaTwain">Shania Twain</a> was one of the first country singers to remix her songs for pop radio and international airplay, usually by stripping the fiddles and steel in favor of more electric guitar and synth. But perhaps one of the most bizarre was "From This Moment On", which was originally a duet with Bryan White and redone for pop as a solo song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar">Lonestar</a> did this twice:
<ul><li> The pop mix of "Amazed" adds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruckDriversGearChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruckDriversGearChange">Truck Driver's Gear Change</a> that is not present in the original.
</li><li> "Tell Her" was completely re-recorded for country radio. The radio version features a full string section and a more forceful vocal, compared to the more subdued, nearly acoustic version on the album. Although their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum">Greatest Hits Album</a> contains the radio edits of a few other songs, it kept the album version of "Tell Her", thus making the radio edit a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup">Bowling for Soup</a> has done at least five different versions of their song "Belgium", each in a different musical style.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi">Bon Jovi</a> has released an entire album of acoustic rearrangements of songs from previous albums, entitled <em>This Left Seems Right</em>.
</li><li> In 2019 '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankTurner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankTurner">Frank Turner</a> released an album called No Man's Land, where each song is a tribute to an undervalued woman. This included a new version of his previous song which fit the pattern, 'Silent Key' from 2015's album Positive Songs For Negative People, which was about Challenger teacher-pilot Christa <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McAuliffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McAuliffe">Mc Auliffe</a>. The words were unchanged but the music slightly jauntier.
</li><li> The radio edit of Pam Tillis' "Maybe It Was Memphis" replaced the electric guitar solo with a steel guitar solo. It also looped the chorus into a fadeout near the end to cover up another guitar solo.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sakanaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sakanaction">Sakanaction</a> songs "Mikazuki Sunset" and "Inner World" were originally from Dutchman, members Ichiro Yamaguchi and Motoharu Iwadera's former band. When they formed Sakanaction, they rearranged both songs and included them in the band's debut album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a> does it right in the same album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImBreathless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ImBreathless">I'm Breathless</a></em>. "Now I'm Following You (Part 2)" is a rearrangement of Part 1 so that it would sound like a 1990s-style dance song.
</li><li> Decoded Feedback remixed "Birth of A Nation", originally released on their 1996 debut album <em>Overdosing</em>, as the "Rebirth Mix" on <em>Combustion</em> in 2005.
</li><li> Suicide Commando remade his 1994 track "Time" as "Time (Rewind)" in 2013.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JudasPriest">Judas Priest</a> remade the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanBaez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanBaez">Joan Baez</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkMusic">Folk Music</a> ballad "Diamonds and Rust" in their trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> style.
</li><li> The much-covered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock">Garage Rock</a> standard "Hey Joe" was usually performed at a frantic tempo, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> version is slow and ominous.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThomasRhett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThomasRhett">Thomas Rhett</a> re-recorded the vocal track for the single release of "Make Me Wanna".
</li><li> Due to a nasty dispute with their record company over digital royalty rates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard">Def Leppard</a> re-recorded and re-released three of their most popular tracks themselves. However these versions are all but identical to the originals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> singer/soldier Keni Thomas's 2005 single "Gloryland" is a cover of an album cut by the band Blackhawk (and it features them on harmony vocals), but with some of the lyrics changed by Thomas to make them more personal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Amorphis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Amorphis">Amorphis</a> released <em>Magic and Mayhem</em>, re-recorded versions of their earlier songs with their then-new singer Tomi Joutsen.
</li><li> Grace Jones' album <em>Slave to the Rhythm</em> is eight radically different variations of the same song. Producer Trevor Horn (of ZTT/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieGoesToHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieGoesToHollywood">Frankie Goes to Hollywood</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBuggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBuggles">The Buggles</a> fame) just couldn't decide on which version to use, so all of them were released. (The single featured an additional two variations of the song.) Fun fact: the version featured in the music video (and the most popularized version) is actually the album closer "Ladies and Gentlemen: Miss Grace Jones"; the song actually called "SLAVE TO THE RHYTHM" is completely different.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chicago">Chicago</a> included a slightly remixed version of "What Kind Of Man Would I Be" (originally from <em>Chicago 19</em>)on their <em>Greatest Hits 1982-1989</em> package. It became their last Top 10 hit, peaking at #5.
<ul><li> In 1986, they recorded a high-tech version of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> "25 Or 6 To 4" for <em>Chicago 18</em>. It stalled at #48 on the singles chart.
</li></ul></li><li> There are two versions of Blackbear's "I Needed You" with vastly different lyrics and tunes.
</li><li> There are versions of "Sky's Still Blue" by Andrew Belle. One is the original and the other is a considerably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> version made for a commericial:
<div class="indent">Original version: <em>You never hold onto what you believe in. I think I've lost you, tell me I'm dreaming. Why do wait to live 'till we begin to die? I made the incision. I begged and I borrowed. 'Traded my vision for heartbreak and sorrow. Now that I've found my side, well I realize I was born to go blind.</em>
</div><div class="indent">Rearranged Version: <em>A vision's a portrait, a palate of colors. We swim in an ocean with blindfolded lovers. And now that I've found my side, I finally realized that it was there the whole time.</em>
</div></li><li> Several versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAgeOfInformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAgeOfInformation">Trading Yesterday</a> songs are reused on other albums. For example "She Is The Sunlight" has a version on More Than This and another on The Beauty And The Tragedy that is missing several lines of lyrics.
</li><li> "All We Are" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneRepublic">OneRepublic</a> comes in two versions. One has the lyrics "Time can tear you apart but it won't break anything that you are (you are)" while the slower version says "Lord I know I failed you time and again, but you and me are alright".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePixies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePixies">The Pixies</a> began playing "Wave of Mutilation" in live gigs in a much slower and more sinister arrangement than the original studio album version, which ended up being very popular with fans. The slow live arrangement was eventually recorded in studio and released officially as a single B-side, where it was titled "Wave Of Mutilation (UK Surf Version)". There have been times where they've actually played the song in both arrangements in the course of the same live performance.
</li><li> Easton Corbin's "Are You with Me" was an album cut on his second album, and in 2014, it was remixed by Belgian DJ Lost Frequencies to international dance success. Due to that version's success, he included the original version on his third album, and sent a slightly faster-tempo remix as a single in 2016.
</li><li> "Stay a Little Longer", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakthroughHit">Breakthrough Hit</a> of the country duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrothersOsborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrothersOsborne">Brothers Osborne</a>, was originally recorded on their self-titled EP in 2014. It was rearranged by producer Jay Joyce with new instrumentation and a longer guitar solo. This version became the single release (although the solo was trimmed for radio) and appeared on their debut album <em>Pawn Shop</em>.
</li><li> Mike Posner's "I Took A Pill In Ibiza" was first released as a slow, acoustic-guitar-based ballad. The better-known version of the song was a remix by production duo Seeb, who gave it an all-electronic, house-music-influenced arrangement. The Seeb remix also cuts the last verse of the song entirely.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Orbital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Orbital">Paul Hartnoll</a>'s "Please", a collaboration with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure">Robert Smith</a> originally released on the former's 2007 album <em>The Ideal Condition</em>, was re-recorded in 2015 under Hartnoll's new alias 8:58.
</li><li> Marc Almond has rerecorded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell">Soft Cell</a>'s breakthrough hit "Tainted Love" on more than one occasion. The final track on the two-disc edition of his 2017 retrospective "Hits and Pieces" is a big band version of the song which he recorded with Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra, who also provided backing when Almond gave his first public performance since his brush with death in a motorcycle accident.
</li><li> A lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHamiltonMixtape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheHamiltonMixtape">The Hamilton Mixtape</a></em> is this to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em>, including "Wait For It", "Satisfied", "You'll Be Back", and "Helpless". "Say Yes To This" uses the same instrumental music as "Say No To This", but tells it from (presumably) Maria Reynold's perspective (as opposed to the original, which was from Hamilton's).
</li><li> In 2005, Keith Anderson had the title track of his debut album <em>Three Chord Country and American Rock &amp; Roll</em> remixed to feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith">Steven Tyler</a> on guest vocals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HunterHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HunterHayes">Hunter Hayes</a>' "Everybody's Got Somebody but Me" was originally a solo song. But for the deluxe version of the corresponding album, he re-recorded it as a duet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonMraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JasonMraz">Jason Mraz</a>. This version was also released as a single.
</li><li> The Ventures remade their breakthrough hit "Walk, Don't Run" in 1964 with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurfRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurfRock">Surf Rock</a> arrangement under the title "Walk, Don't Run '64". It became as big of a hit as the original was in 1960, making it the first instance of a band hitting the Top 10 twice with two different versions of the same song.
</li><li> The single version of The Revivalists' "Wish I Knew You" is subtly different from the original, having the guitars mixed differently, an echo effect on David Shaw's vocals, and some more synthesizers, giving it more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave</a>/Disco influence.
</li><li> The single version of Babybird's "Cornershop" is more energetic and power chord-heavy than the original version, which has a more loungy sound.
</li><li> Compare the original version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Panopticon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Panopticon">Panopticon</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRFPuHKf7eI">"...Speaking..."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the so called <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrsP77fjE68">"collapsed version"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He turned a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> track into a calm track using banjos as the only instrument.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeanMichelJarre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeanMichelJarre">Jean-Michel Jarre</a> did this a couple of times, mostly for or after concerts.
<ul><li> Several songs were extended at live performances, e.g. to add a solo at the end, such as "Magnetic Fields 2" or "Rendez-vous 4".
</li><li> Jarre himself did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion">Cover Version</a> of his own "Zig-Zag" from the <em>Les Granges Brûlées</em> soundtrack under one of his many pseudonyms (which kind of made it obvious that the guy behind this pseudonym was in fact Jarre).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsAlbum">Greatest Hits Album</a> <em>Images</em> contains a heavily shortened edit of the <em>Paris La Défense</em> live version of "Equinoxe 4". What makes it particular is Christophe Deschamps' drum playing.
</li><li> "Equinoxe 5" got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix">Not-Remix</a> for the CD release of the album: The doubled string melody disappeared, the hi-hat doesn't disappear at certain points anymore, the FX were partly redone.
</li><li> Jarre performed "Equinoxe 7" a.k.a. "Band In The Rain" on a barrel organ during a TV interview once. This became so popular that he'd play it on a barrel organ on stage at various concerts.
</li><li> "Magnetic Fields 2" got the first bits of a new melody at <em>Destination Docklands</em>, it was retooled to the new melody entirely at <em>Paris La Défense</em>, and <em>Images</em> included a new studio version based on the <em>La Défense</em> recording.
</li><li> Of all changes done to "Magnetic Fields 2" for live performances, the one for the 1997 <em>Oxygène Arena Tour</em> was the most drastic: It was slowed down to a dancefloor tempo and re-arranged to something trance-like. This didn't stick, though.
</li><li> The "Overture" of <em>The Concerts In China</em> is actually "Magnetic Fields 1 Part 1" at half speed with a few additions.
</li><li> "Orient Express" from the same album was re-recorded entirely for <em>Images</em>.
</li><li> "Souvenir Of China" got a synth solo at <em>Paris La Défense</em>, a guitar solo at the <em>Concert pour la tolérance</em>, a new synth solo at the <em>Oxygène Arena Tour</em> and a full orchestral backing during the first half of the 2000s, starting with <em>The Twelve Dreams Of The Sun</em>.
</li><li> <em>Zoolook</em> and <em>Rendez-vous</em> contain snippets from songs Jarre had written for French singers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> as well as material taken over from his one-copy album <em>Music For Supermarkets</em>.
</li><li> <em>Zoolook</em> is another interesting case: Only a very few CDs were originally pressed with the same music as the vinyl release. The actual CD release contains remixes of both the title track and "Zoolookologie". For the 24-bit remastered editions, the original versions returned.
</li><li> Like "Souvenir Of China", "Rendez-vous 2" got an orchestral treatment at <em>The Twelve Dreams Of The Sun</em>. At the same time, it was shortened to what could usually be found on official live releases (barring the extreme edit from the <em>La Défense</em> VHS tape).
</li><li> The title track from <em>Revolutions</em> was rearranged for <em>Paris La Défense</em> to be accompanied by an actual Arab string orchestra and a new singer. This required an entirely new intro, gave the song some new string parts all over and a new title: "Revolution, Revolutions". As for the original recording, since Jarre didn't obtain the rights on the Ney intro, he isn't allowed to include it on the album anymore. It has been replaced with "Revolution, Revolutions" from <em>La Défense</em> on all 24-bit remastered releases.
</li><li> "Eldorado", first released on <em>Images</em>, was reworked for the 1992 multimedia show <em>Legends Of The Lost City</em> with longer breaks in the vocal parts and a new ending.
</li><li> The 1995 <em>Concert pour la tolérance</em> contains an unexpected new version of the third movement from the summer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntonioVivaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntonioVivaldi">Antonio Vivaldi</a>'s <em>Four Seasons</em> — as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3fxad');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3fxad" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3fxad');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This actually came from Patrick Rondat, the guitar player whom Jarre was working with at the time. He'd jokingly play that piece during rehearsals, and he could give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YngwieMalmsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YngwieMalmsteen">Yngwie Malmsteen</a> a run for his money. Jarre liked it so much that he decided to include it into the concert, tight schedule or not. This is also the only piece of music at the entire concert with no synthesizers.</span> It returned at a few occasions in the 2000s, now re-arranged as a house/metal fusion.
</li><li> While <em>The Twelve Dreams Of The Sun</em> also served as a showcase for Jarre's upcoming album <em>Metamorphoses</em>, the songs had to be adapted to the live situation more or less. That said, "Gloria, Lonely Boy" was rearranged to be played only by the orchestra.
</li><li> The "Hymn To Acropolis" from the <em>Acropolis</em> concert is ever-so-barely recognizable as a thoroughly retooled "Give Me A Sign" from <em>Metamorphoses</em>.
</li><li> The <em>Aero</em> concert included "Light My Sky" which is a rearranged version of "Tout Est Bleu" from <em>Metamorphoses</em>.
</li><li> Except for two brand-new songs, the album <em>Aero</em> consists of half-remakes of older material — plus the title track which is actually a heavily reworked "Je me souviens" from <em>Metamorphoses</em>.
</li><li> <em>The Orchestral Jean-Michel Jarre</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>: an official <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsCompilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHitsCompilation">Greatest Hits Compilation</a> played by an orchestra.
</li><li> For the 30th anniversary of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oxygene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oxygene">Oxygène</a></em>, Jarre re-recorded the whole album. Then he took three co-musicians and a whole lot of mostly vintage gear to a sound stage in Belgium and redid it yet again, this time in front of cameras and with three new pieces woven in, the "Variations".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HIM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HIM">HIM</a> are an example of an artist who would rearrange a song and give the result a new title. Their early song "Stigmata Diaboli" eventually morphed into the B-side "Sigillum Diaboli", and there's also "One Last Time" which gave way to "The 9th Circle (OLT)"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ugm6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ugm6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ugm6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"OLT" referring to the original title of the song</span>.
</li><li> Robert Smith and Quartet Voluté recorded a string quartet version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCure">The Cure</a>'s "Pictures Of You" for the soundtrack to the documentary<em>Dead Good</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharliXCX">Charli XCX</a> had an unusually roundabout case with a song recorded as "Blame It On Your Love". The original demo (not publicly released, but was known through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentLeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentLeak">leaks</a> circa 2017) was a perfectly straightforward pop song you could hear on the radio, but its proper release came in the form of "Track 10" on her <em>Pop 2</em> mixtape, preserving the vocals but rearranged into a far more avant-garde and glitched-out ballad. With her 2019 album <em>Charli</em>, however, "Blame It On Your Love" was given another go and released as a finished version of the original demo, effectively making it an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">un</a></em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">arrangement</a>.
</li><li> A major offender in Japanese rock scene is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock">Hard Rock</a> duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bz">B'z</a>:
<ul><li> Various of their past hits usually have rearranged versions (since remixes to remake the song from scratch) in newer albums and even they translated some of them into English. The most known case is the song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwm21gkudEw">Samayoeru Aoi Dangan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", remade completely, sung in English, and renamed as "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XBlBPtQW6g">Into Free - Dangan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", used as part of the OST of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonsDogma">Dragon's Dogma</a></em>.
</li><li> Some of the singles released exclusively for the OST as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Shoudou</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Burnout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Burnout">Friction</a>" obtained reversions with more guitars in some of their albums. For example, this is the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arKdhIMyLTg">original version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em>Burnout Dominator/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise">Paradise</a></em>'s "Friction" and this is the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7FR7h1o1rI">-LAP 2- version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from 2007's <em>Action</em> album.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2017, Tracy Bonham released <em>Modern Burdens</em>, a track by track rearrangement of her 1996 debut <em>The Burdens Of Being Upright</em> (plus one new song, "Free"). Sometimes both the lyrics and music are changed - for instance, not only is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> "Mother Mother" changed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a> to blues rock, the second verse adds contemporary political references (e.g. climate change and Donald Trump).
</li><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Waterparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Waterparks">Waterparks</a>, Entertainment 2019 and Double Dare 2019 are single track mashups of the original Double Dare and Entertainment albums. Recorded over the course of four days, with two days dedicated to each, these were made out of necessity; while Equal Vision now owns the album versions of Double Dare and Entertainment, Waterparks owns the 2019 versions. The tracks reorder the song order, cherrypick lyrics from certain songs with varying emphasis (with songs like "11:11" and "Stupid For You" barely having any at all), clearer vocals, vocal delivery that either differs from or is surprisingly near 1:1 with the original, and a production approach that brings the content more in line with the band's third album, <em>FANDOM</em>.
</li><li> Casket Girls' <em>The Piano Album</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConceptAlbum">Concept Album</a> in that it features piano as the lead instrument (the band usually uses synthesizers and drum machines) - as bonus tracks, it includes new versions of two songs from their previous album, "Same Side" and "The Chase", rearranged for piano and vocals.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato">Demi Lovato</a> released an "emo remix" of her song "I Love Me", which used the same vocal track but set it to emo/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk">Pop Punk</a> style electric guitars and live drums instead of the synthesizers and drum machines of the original version.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a>: His 1988-1997 theme "Hart Beat," which was rescored and evolved into "Hart Attack," but beneath the surface remained the same theme until his final match (the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob">Montreal Screwjob</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Christian">Christian</a>'s theme "Just Close Your Eyes" by Story Of The Year, was originally performed by Waterproof Blonde.
</li><li> And when Christian's best buddy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a> adopted Alter Bridge's <em>"Metalingus"</em>, it was <em>literally</em> rearranged. The rapid-fire heavier drum/guitar riff that ends the song on the album forms <em>the beginning</em> of Edge's entrance music before jumping back to the iconic <em>"On this day...!"</em> refrain, which first occurs about 55 seconds into the actual song.
</li><li> After leaving Legacy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody Rhodes</a> got the theme song "Smoke and Mirrors". A slower, darker, more morose, mostly instrumental version was used during his "ugly" phase. Upon becoming Stardust, he gained the theme tune "Written in the Stars"; a more whimsical, stringed interpretation following the same chord structure.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheCorre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheCorre">The Corre</a> theme song, "End of Days" was tweaked many times in their 6 months of existence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a>'s first solo theme song was "I am Perfection" by Cage 9. This was later covered by Downstait, then reworked into "Here to Show the World", also by Downstait.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>'s theme in the WWF/WWE took a slight turn around 2006 with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. By this time, it was practically obliged for people to chant "You suck!" during a two-note solo melody in his song. The newer version edited this portion out, so as to keep people from chanting it regardless of his Face turn.
<ul><li> Ironically, the chants were originally just his name, with the crowd singing "Angle!" along with the music, inspired by an Edge and Christian bit where they played his theme on a kazoo. It wasn't until later that it turned into "You suck!" (also thanks to Edge) You'd think the crowd would just go back to chanting his name.
</li><li> After the Invasion, Kurt briefly used <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6iL_GgaiT8">a metal remix<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of his theme.
</li></ul></li><li> During Jacques Rougeau's run as rogue lawman The Mountie, he used the narcissist "I'm the Mountie!" (a heel marching tune) as his entrance theme. When he began teaming with Pierre Oulette as The Quebecers in 1993, the theme was reworked to "We're Not the Mounties," with Rougeau and Oulette re-recording the theme as a duet. The instrumentation was slightly re-worked, but the only changes to the lyrics were the title line and first-person pronouns (e.g., I, my) were made plural (we and our, respectively).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock's</a> theme continually evolved from <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S5FBA5icqY">when he entered the WWF as Rocky Maivia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; first becoming <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n8yyfKYgl4">more bluesy as he joined The Nation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, then <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bHmMlq3X0E">becoming more percussion heavy and adding an electric guitar track<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a64ZFK0gBs">becoming more elaborate as he became a bigger and bigger star<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Afterwards he used a theme that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong">vaguely sounded</a> like H-Blockx's "Oh, Hell Yeah" until the end of the Invasion.

</li><li> The theme music to NPR's <em>All Things Considered</em> news program has had at least 4 different arrangements over the years. <em>Morning Edition</em> has had at least 2 arrangements.
</li><li> The CBS radio top-of-the-hour news sounder was rearranged with an orchestral sound at some point in the 2000's.

(The burlesque band is said to be provided with the exact same arrangements used earlier; this is obviously not actually true.)
</li><li> Also used within the show of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Dreamgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Dreamgirls">Dreamgirls</a></em> to represent two songs being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a>: Jimmy and the Dreamettes' exuberant version of "Cadillac Car" is replaced by a practically easy-listening version by Dave and the Sweethearts, while Effie's soulful "One Night Only" vies with Deena and the Dreams' disco version.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a>'s concert tour <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Delirium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Delirium">Delirium</a></em> merged this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewrittenPopVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewrittenPopVersion">Rewritten Pop Version</a> for a set list of songs derived from most of the shows from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Saltimbanco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Saltimbanco">Saltimbanco</a></em> through <em>Varekai</em>.
</li><li> In addition to the many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">cut songs</a>, the songs of <em>Vanities: A New Musical</em> were often rearranged, shortened, extended, or had their lyrics changed slightly between productions, e.g. the middle verse of "I Can't Imagine" and the first verse of "An Organized Life 1968" were cut; "Let Life Happen" was rearranged when it was moved to where "We're Gonna Be Ok (Feelin' Sunny)" used to be; "In The Same Place" became "The Same Old Music"; "Counterpoint", a repetitive short reprise of "I Can't Imagine", was turned into a longer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise">Dark Reprise</a> titled "The Argument"; "Friendship Isn't What It Used to Be", originally a solo by Kathy, was rewritten as a trio, and its bridge completely reworked; and "Looking Good" had its final chorus extended and a short reprise of "Setting Your Sights" added as an outtro.
<ul><li> This was also done in-show with the scene intro song("Hey There, Beautiful", "Setting Your Sights", or "Mystery", depending on the production) as well as "An Organized Life" (and "Nothing Like A Friend" in the original Theatreworks run), for each scene.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2011 stage adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> uses the full original lyrics of "Arabian Nights", and also restores the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutSong">previously unused</a> reprises of that song.
</li><li> The songs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JerseyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/JerseyBoys">Jersey Boys</a></em> are subtly rearranged from the original versions by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieValliAndTheFourSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieValliAndTheFourSeasons">Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons</a>. Most of the songs are slightly faster, with a different instrument mix and a verse cut out so they can all fit in a two-hour musical.

Something similar was done for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo2">Halo 2</a>: Anniversary</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis">Time Crisis</a> 3</em> uses a very different theme tune than the other installments, although you can still hear vestiges of the original, and on top of that, it features an epic rearrangement of Wild Dog's theme.

</li><li> Most of the music from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> was rearranged for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> remake; and consequently became much creepier.

<ul><li> Subverted with the spinoff and preview games. Most don't feature the song at all, or in the case of <em>Gran Turismo 5: Prologue</em>, actually have a new arrangement of the song playing over the <em>ending</em> credits.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> does this frequently, both in its rearrangements of the overworld and underworld themes from the first game for subsequent games, and (especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisStory">Yoshi's Story</a></em>) also within a game. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> is just as guilty of doing this with the games' main themes (<em>especially</em> in <em>Brawl</em>).

</li><li> Several pieces of music have been reused and rearranged many times, most notably the drowning music and the results music. Drowning music has been used since the first game but it's always rearranged. The results music has been generally the same since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> but again, it's been rearranged.
</li><li> Starting with <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, the multiple Acts for each stage will often be rearrangements of the first Act's music.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD">Sonic the Hedgehog CD</a></em> did this (at least in the Japanese soundtrack) with the four "time period" themes, having a different take on the same tune for the present, past, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">bad future</a>, and good future versions of each level.
</li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> used a rearrangement of the series' traditional title screen music that added a new part to the melody. The second one took that part and made it the main melody, with the traditional melody still appearing, but only later in the song.
</li><li> The arpegio from the menus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a> 8: Imperishable Night</em> has been included in many later songs.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em> arcade game has a screen counting up all the enemies defeated in a level, aptly titled the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">"Korpse Kount".</a> The music for this screen is a subtle remix of the NES game's first level theme.
</li><li> The Extra Mode in the home version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RayStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RayStorm">Ray Storm</a></em> has an optional "Neu Tanz Mix" rearrangement of the soundtrack. Some of the remixes, such as "Geometric City", are radically different from the originals.
</li><li> Many examples in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AngryBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AngryBirds">Angry Birds</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Many of the "Seasons" levels have rearrangements of the main theme appropriate to the season.
</li><li> "Rio" uses a samba arrangement of the main theme.
</li><li> "Space" uses a bombastic orchestral arrangement of the theme in the style of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnWilliams">John Williams</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDragonNeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDragonNeon">Double Dragon Neon</a></em>'s soundtrack includes rearrangements of, in addition to the series' iconic title theme, the Mission Bumper, City Slum, Industrial Area, Cave 2, and Palace themes from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDragon1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDragon1">Double Dragon 1</a></em>; and the Mission 1, Stage Clear, and Intermission themes from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDragonII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDragonII">Double Dragon II</a></em>.

<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://parappatherapper.wikia.com/wiki/Make_It_Sweet!">As discussed here in greater detail,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> most of the songs on the album were reworked from <em>UmJammer Lammy</em>'s original versions. Some changes were superficial (e.g. Katy Kat singing on most of the songs instead of the game's teachers, minor adjustments to some of the lyrics), and some were radical (e.g. a completely new music track for "BIRTH SONG", which uses the lyrics and melody of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksiml9wrHqs">"Treasure"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). The biggest example of this is "TASTE OF TERIYAKI", which had the vocals greatly slowed down and the uptempo music replaced with something more atmospheric in the verses, while the chorus is left intact and the fadeout contains vocals from PaRappa's version of the song.
</li><li> The unlockable PaRappa mode in the game contains reworked versions of all the songs from the main game, with new lyrics and more hip-hop inspired iterations of the music.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>'s main theme was reworked for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>.

Every piece used is a remix of a theme used previously in the game, with the final boss's forms all using remixes of the various main themes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> had "Legends of Azeroth" as its original login music.

</li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheGuild">The Guild</a> started out with an entirely synthesized instrumental theme song - fitting the premise of the show, it sounded like something out of an MMORPG loading screen. By season five it got some fuller orchestration, including an electric guitar playing the lead melody instead of the synthesizers. The simpler version of the theme was reprised at the end of the very last episode to further emphasize a use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book-Ends</a> dialogue.

The fourth version aired from Season 6 to the middle of Season 10 and also has two sub-versions (the first, heard only in S6, has Timmy reciting Kenny's lines - while the second brings back Kenny). While the current version has aired since the second half of Season 10.
</li><li> The show's closing credits theme (which it has used throughout its entire run) is an instrumental rendition of the <em>first</em> version of its main theme.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> rearranged the theme into a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> themes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossibleMovieSoTheDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossibleMovieSoTheDrama">Kim Possible Movie: So the Drama</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Noddy In Toyland</em> uses a remixed version of the theme to Chorion's earlier <em>Noddy</em> production, <em>Make Way For Noddy</em>.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> featured many of the show's songs being performed in radically different styles from their previous versions. (For instance, the Disney-esque ballad "Black Chick's Tongue" was performed in a hard rock style, while the Ling-Ling battle theme was transformed into a sultry jazz number.) The show was also prone to rearranging its theme song to suit the needs of certain episodes; for instance, a Tejano-style version of the theme was used for an episode which took place in Mexico.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExtremeGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExtremeGhostbusters">Extreme Ghostbusters</a></em> turns the franchise's famous theme song into a sinister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeRock">Alternative Rock</a> number, in keeping with the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> mood.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRaccoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRaccoons">The Raccoons</a></em>, the ending theme "Run With Us" was sung by Steve Lunt and was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStanzaSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStanzaSong">Single Stanza Song</a>, but in all subsequent seasons, it was performed by Lisa Lougheed (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">Lisa Raccoon</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewrittenPopVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewrittenPopVersion">with additional lyrics</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic">Soul Music</a></em>, Buddy follows up playing his beautiful, haunting harp masterwork "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Sioni Bod Da</a>" by grabbing his guitar and playing a Music With Rocks version of the same piece. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>'s "The Messenger" captures this beautifully.
</li><li> Virtually all of the music in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> is the theme song rescored to match the musical style of the part of the world that episode takes place in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> began using a different version of its theme song (with new animation) early in Season 2, starting with a short revealing the full lyrics of the song. (International broadcast still use the original opening.)
</li><li> For a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League Unlimited</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> (along with more era-appropriate heroes like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex">Jonah Hex</a> are riding through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest">Wild West</a> on horses on their way to the lair of the episode's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, a Western-ised version of the theme music from the original Justice League plays.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a>, Where Are You!</em> had its theme redone in season two to a more bubblegum pop arrangement.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a></em> switched from Ruby-Spears to Murakami-Wolf-Swenson in its sixth season (later to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiCEntertainment">DiC Entertainment</a> that same year), a re-mixed version of the theme song was used for the main titles (a completely new instrumental theme was used for the end titles).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original series has two versions of the theme song: The English version for "serious" episodes, and the Japanese version for "silly" episodes. They got this mixed up with the episode "Nevermore", the one about Raven's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad">daddy issues</a>, which was supposed to be a serious episode but used the silly theme by mistake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DCNation">DC Nation</a> shorts that inspired it each have a theme based on the original. <em>Go!</em> specifically boasts a remix by Mix Master Mike, best known for his work with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BeastieBoys">Beastie Boys</a>. How appropriate given that one of the Titans is <em>named</em> Beast Boy...
</li></ul></li><li> A slightly different version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> theme song "You're Standing On My Neck" played in the first four episodes (And a few season one episodes after that) of the series, though it was still performed by Splendora, who performed the standard version of the theme, and was almost the same as the standard version instrumental-wise. It's possible that this "first version" was a demo.
</li><li> For the second season onward, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> featured a brand new opening with several new clips that also replaced its synth tune theme song with a brand new pop version (based off the full-length edition of the theme recorded by the Jets). Interestingly enough, some later episodes would still use the original opening but with the new remixed song. And just to make things more confusing, some VHS tapes from the early 90's also featured the the show's second opening but with the <em>original</em> mix of the song. The original mix was also featured on some read-along cassette tapes, and it can still be seen in most of the first season episodes on the first volume of the show's DVD release.
</li><li> A lot of people don't know this, but the opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> is a rearranged version! Before the show premiered in syndication in the fall of 1991, the Disney Channel aired it on weekend mornings over the preceding spring and summer. The opening for those airings, as seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2UFFzPsSsg">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> featured a heavy guitar riff, no sax in the background, and some completely different singers. Unlike the case for <em>Chip 'N Dale Rescue Rangers</em>, the original arrangement, has never been used again in any reruns, home media or any other material, suggesting the original masters of it may have been lost.
</li><li> Similarly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em> used a rerecorded version of the main theme from Season Two onwards. Interestingly with the this change, the end credits, originally using a short orchestral remix of the opening, were lengthened to just use a full, mostly instrumental version of the rerecorded opening, subverting the trope. Some airings or VHS releases also reveal other variations, such as end credits with the Season One opening instrumental, and a version of the opening sung by Jim Cummings (who also voices Pooh).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> series has done this so many times with "The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down" and "Merrily We Roll Along" that finding and listing all of the different versions would probably take forever.
</li><li> The theme song to the 2006 revival of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BikerMiceFromMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BikerMiceFromMars">Biker Mice from Mars</a></em> is a remix of the theme song of the original 1993 series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wabbit">Wabbit</a></em> kept the same lyrics to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune">Theme Tune</a> but rearranged the song itself from jazz to country halfway through season one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a></em> went through this twice:
<ul><li> The first alteration of the theme song first appeared on "Pistachio: The Little Boy That Woodn't". The theme had all the characters sing the entire theme song rather than Bob doing the first verse and a chorus doing the rest. It also removed the dialogue between Bob and Larry at the beginning for a tuba solo by Larry and also had one of the verses being cut.
</li><li> The second alteration of the theme song appeared on videos starting with "Noah's Ark" and had Bob sing the first verse, but kept the same vocals for the last few verses from the first alteration.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> went through this a couple of times. The first was the "While Bill Clinton plays the sax" verse. It was changed twice as a backup lyric in case Clinton didn't win the '96 Election. The second was Pinky &amp; the Brain's verse, since their segments for the most part became its own series, the verse was replaced with a verse about the Warners' supporting cast<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5jjxw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5jjxw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5jjxw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ralph, Dr. Scratchansniff, and Hello Nurse</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em> had a few changes. The first not only replaced the ninja code lyrics with a character introduction, but as Shredder was defeated, we're shown the Turtles on the perch Shredder's usually on with Michaelangelo dancing and holding Shredder's helmet, proclaiming "We shredded Shredder!" It changed again when Karai took over, returning the original "Watch out for Shredder!", but with Karai saying it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DuckTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DuckTales">DuckTales</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>, naturally, uses a remix of the iconic theme song from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">the original series</a>.
</li><li> Some airings and foreign dubs of the original series also utilised <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVwcs_ChxiQ">a synth remix of the original arrangement<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as well. This rendition also made its way into some audiobooks.
</li></ul></li><li> The theme music of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOctonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOctonauts">The Octonauts</a></em> was re-arranged in the fourth season with the same basic tune but with eastern-sounding instruments.
</li><li> The theme song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DocMcStuffins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DocMcStuffins">Doc McStuffins</a></em> was given a new, much jazzier arrangement with altered lyrics and a new vocalist when the Toy Hospital was introduced.
