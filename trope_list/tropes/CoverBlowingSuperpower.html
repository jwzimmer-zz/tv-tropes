</li><li> When most of the fighters are signing up for the world martial arts tournament, most of them have to hold back when punching a strength-testing machine in order to produce believable results. Sadly, the officials thought the machine may be off because they are <em>still</em> getting ridiculous numbers, particularly Android 18's 700 (from just rapping it lightly with one knuckle) and every Z fighter scoring well over 200, much higher than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Mr. Satan</a>'s score of 137. Until Vegeta just hauls off and pulverizes the thing.

Since Jellal's a wanted criminal, he's disguised as Mystogan (his counterpart from Edolas, who keeps his face concealed), and is forced to fight with magical staves like Mystogan does. Said staves aren't quite enough to defeat his opponent, Jura, so Jellal is about to unleash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Sema</a> on Jura, only for his companions Ultear and Meredy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">knock him out by burning him with hot sauce</a> and causing him to lose the match, so that he won't reveal his identity.

To get a meeting with a Hydra contact, one of them needs to win at an underground fight club. May, who is by far the better combatant, wants to do it, but Hunter points out that she's <em>so</em> good that it would blow their cover; a tiny Asian woman annihilating her opponents while demonstrating years of combat training is noteworthy and may get back to Ward, but a muscular man winning in a relatively unskilled brawl won't draw any attention.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, John Diggle is hired to be the bodyguard for millionaire playboy Oliver Queen and quickly realizes that there is more to Oliver than it seems. Oliver keeps slipping away from Diggle in ways that a spoiled rich kid with no training should not be able to. The clincher comes when Laurel is attacked by Triad assassins and Oliver saves her life by throwing a knife at an attacker's hand. Throwing a knife that precisely is very hard and this was an ordinary unbalanced table knife rather than a custom made throwing knife. The level of skill Oliver displayed could only have been acquired after years of training and practice.

When Lindsay dismisses the allegations against his client as "childish, if they weren't so sad," Angel hurls an object directly over her head. She instinctively jerks her arm up and snags the object, exposing her super-awareness for all to see. She's still acquitted thanks to Lindsey's legal maneuvering, much to Angel's frustration.
</li><li> Inverted when Wesley is pretending to be Angel and inadvertently places his hand on a cross. Angel is a vampire and can't touch crosses without getting burned.
</li></ul></li><li> Michael Westen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> is a badass, but frequently spends episodes undercover in notably un-badass personas. This gets annoying when it would be tactically advantageous to not win fights, which means Westen has to forgo using his skills and get an ass-kicking instead. This is usually played straight, but sometimes for comedy, as the camera cuts to his face to show him bored and disdainful of his opponent's flailing failure to hurt him.

</li><li> In the third episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CovertAffairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CovertAffairs">Covert Affairs</a></em>, the corrupt Venezuelan government official Annie's covertly investigating encourages her to drive his sports car as ridiculously fast as he does. She grinds the gears and pretends to be out of her depth, but the sudden appearance of an unexpected roadblock causes her to reflexively swerve around it in a way that gives away her advanced driving skills.

For example, in the pilot, he ends up being in a subway crash. He is fine after reappearing in the Hudson River (he always appears in a nearby body of water), but the detective investigating the crash finds his antique pocket watch and wants to know how it got there. His arch-nemesis Adam even does him a favor once, after a suspect causes Henry a slow but fatal wound. As the cops are closing in, Adam slits Henry's throat as a favor, in order to keep his immortality (as well as Adam's own) a secret, resulting in Henry dying (and vanishing) before the cops get there. In the finale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this happens one too many times, so his detective partner demands to know the truth. The episode ends with him starting to tell her</span>.

The new boss ends up trying to force Darien to be his personal assassin.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendOfTheSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendOfTheSeeker">Legend of the Seeker</a></em>, Zedd is pretending to be a puppeteer to a petulant teenage monarch (using his magic to animate the puppets). It seems to work, but then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Darken Rahl</a> arrives for a visit and wishes to see the puppeteer perform. He immediately realizes that powerful magic is at work here and is able to deduce Zedd's name by the fact that there are only two wizards of the First Order left, and the other one works for him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em>, all the time. Usually Clark will use his powers and come up with some other excuse to cover it up, such as claiming he can read lips to explain how he knows something he picked up via super-hearing, or explaining that the ropes he tore through with his super-strength were frayed. In particular the season 1 episode "Fly Hard", in which terrorists take hostages at the <em>Daily Planet</em> — including Clark, all his friends, <em>and</em> Lex Luthor.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>, the title wizard must constantly save the day while keeping his powers secret, since magic is banned in Camelot on pain of execution.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoOrdinaryFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoOrdinaryFamily">No Ordinary Family</a></em>, the plot is essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieHardOnAnX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieHardOnAnX">"Die Hard" on an X</a>, where the X is a police station held hostage. The super strong and invulnerable police sketch artist played by Michael Chiklis could easily deal with the hostage-takers, but he doesn't want to reveal his powers to his coworkers and is wary of how the criminals would react if they knew the guy after them was superpowered. So instead, he hides and moves through the vents, picking them off one by one.

</li><li> Clark tries to play in a football team for awhile, believing he can stay within the bounds of human ability. For awhile, it works, but in "Recruit", he met a person who tried something similar, and it worked for him as well... until he got to college, where he found that impossible due to the higher performance standards. He ends up killing a person in the episode he appears in, so Clark decides to quit the team before it's too late.

</li><li> Inverted in the episode "Hex", when Clark is bewitched to believe he's an ordinary man, but still has all his superpowers. He comes up with all kinds of explanations for his superpowers — the doorhandle was rusty so of course it came off, the acoustics are amazing so of course he can hear sounds from miles away, etc. Chloe tries to appeal to the one power he couldn't explain away — invulnerability, swings a large pipe at him but misses.
</li><li> But it was played straight by Lionel Luthor, when he was pretending to be blind. His long-lost son Lucas realized because "...when a blind man serves wine, he puts his finger in the cup to know when it's full. Also, you couldn't hide your reaction when I didn't sign that contract."

Once, having no time to slip away and get into the Zorro outfit, he must enter a swordfight without blowing up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Rich Idiot With No Day Job</a> cover before Commander Monasterio, thus pretending to be a clumsy swordsman but still blocking every of the villain's attacks. He then, for Monasterio, tries to pass off his success as sheer luck. Keep in mind the villain was considered the best swordsman in the province. The final "move" he pulls in the fight is as follows: Don Diego goes in for a clumsy but powerful thrust which is easily parried by the villain, causing Diego to "jam" his own sword into a rock crevice. As Diego is pretending to desperately try to yank the sword out, the villain gloats a little and goes for the fatal blow. At that precise moment Diego summons all his strength and "finally" pulls his weapon free, causing him to stagger backwards and "flail" his sword, knocking his unsuspecting opponent's weapon out of his hand and over the side of the cliff, winning the fight.

See, Sirens are created by a mysterious phenomenon known as the Song, which comes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> reaching back to prevent it from coming to pass. As such, in reverse of most other World of Darkness gamelines, the Song <em>wants</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">The Masquerade</a> broken, to pass on its warning to as many people as possible.

This is a problem for Sirens because they have plenty of pragmatic reasons to stay hidden from Muggles as well as the fact that their mermaid form tends to be useless on land.

Urathra regeneration means they can quickly heal from injuries, and thus survive damage that would be fatal to a human — with enough time and will, they can even regrow severed limbs. The problem is that this draws considerable suspicion if an Uratha is involved in some manner of accident and then turns out to not have a scratch on them — especially if medical personnel were attending to them when they genuinely did have serious injuries minutes ago. "Blood of the Wolf" actually features a short bit of fiction depicting a werewolf who struggles to keep from regenerating damage because he's being tended to by well-meaning human paramedics, only to lose control when they inject him with a painkiller. The same book also mentions, and depicts in a short bit of fiction, that this same regeneration gives werewolves a much longer lifespan than humans (in theory, a werewolf could live forever if they got powerful enough) and they don't start visibly aging until late in their life (according to the book, a werewolf basically looks in their late 20s to early 30s until they're about <em>75-80 years old</em>). Again, this can be problematic if humans start looking into a werewolf's paperwork.

Additionally, if an Engineer's machines suddenly all have Sappers on them (or you hear the Engineer yell about this), then that's a dead giveaway a Spy is in the area; time to bring out the flamethrowers.

<ul><li> This is a big motivation behind Servants wanting to conceal their identity. Generally, the only ways one's true name will be discovered are if the Servant tells someone, another Servant is familiar with them, or they use their Noble Phantasm. Knowing a Servant's identity is a huge boon for when you face them, since you'll have a pretty good idea of how they will fight and what their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> is. Saber, for example, would be outed as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Arthur</span> very quickly if she were throwing around <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">EXCALIBAAAA!</span> willy-nilly.
</li><li> Amusingly, even the one hero whose weapons truly cannot be used to identify him can be identified just by giving some thought to the fact that "he possesses the weapons of other heroes". As Shirou points out, only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gilgamesh, the original Heroic Spirit</span> could possess <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all of the world's treasures, since he ruled before mankind spread throughout the world</span>. Of course, he's so incredibly egotistical that he rarely cares whether people know who he is; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> he introduces himself to the other heroes by name.
</li><li> As the Heroic Spirits get knowledge of each other from the Throne of Heroes where they reside, heroes from older legends can piece together the identities of heroes from after their time. Noble Phantasms are almost always a dead giveaway since they are utterly indispensable and tied to the hero's legend. This actually makes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Archer, aka Heroic Spirit EMIYA</span> a complete mystery <em>even when he does show off his abilities</em> since it should be impossible for anyone to have such a diverse mix of weapons and treating them as completely disposable is unthinkable for any other Servant. This is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as a Counter Guardian from the future, he is not properly in the Throne of Heroes and knowledge from the Throne does not include him. He had to engage in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> to get summoned at all</span>.

When he and Grif are locked in a jail cell it seems like an ideal time to use that ability, only for things to be subverted when the door is opened before Church can try it, so Grif ends up thinking he has telekinesis. In <em>Reconstruction</em>, Church tries not to show Washington he can step out of his body, but Simmons sucks at making distractions so Wash finds out anyway.

Bruce is put in the unenviable position of having to fight his captor at about half-strength to keep his companion (who knew of his ninja training, but not his identity) from putting two and two together. He probably would have lost had Robin not rushed her out of sight before he got too beaten up. Not to mention the fear Bruce almost certainly felt when facing the ninja, who according to Alfred was the only guy who could beat him at the Japanese dojo where Bruce learned the martial arts. It's worth noting that Robin didn't seem to have any trouble fighting the ninja, and it's just as likely that knowing Robin had his back was what allowed Bruce to fight back and win. The later episode "Day of the Samurai" reveals that Ken was not fooled by the ruse in the long run.
