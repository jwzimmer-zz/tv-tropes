While she consistently gets better grades than everyone, being 5 years younger than everyone means she has problems during P.E. and Sex Ed talks.

Most Shinigami can never obtain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">bankai</a> but Hitsugaya is the youngest person to learn it in the history of Soul Society. However, his power is not fully developed and he lacks the experience of other captains and their emotional maturity (he still sometimes acts like a child trying to do an adult's job). Nevertheless, Kyouraku (one of the oldest and most powerful captains) has said that Hitsugaya will probably surpass him in the next 100 years.
</li><li> Gin Ichimaru is a child when he entered the Shinigami Academy, but he completed the six year programme in a single year, the first person to ever achieve that. His first act upon joining the Gotei 13 is to kill a Third Seat without sustaining injury, immediately replacing him in that post. It's implied he became a captain later than he could have because Aizen tried to keep him as his lieutenant for as long as possible. He eventually becomes a captain 50 years before the current storyline, although over Aizen's objections.
</li><li> Yachiru is the Lieutenant of the most combat-capable Gotei 13 division despite being a tiny child who physically appears to be anywhere between 6-8 years old. Although Kenpachi's enormous reiatsu can floor even Seated Officers, Yachiru's been able to handle it ever since she was an infant. Her Zanpakutou is considered unique, manifesting beings to empower Yachiru's striking power and reach despite Zanpakutou not being able to do that. Her battle instincts are also considered incredible; she can adapt to even invisible opponents with so much speed it's considered uncanny. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's eventually revealed it's because she's Kenpachi's manifested Zanpakutou spirit.</span>

Mozart is even lampshaded as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a>, since he is known as the "Wonderkind" (<em>kinder</em> means child in German).
</li><li> Falin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em> is this. As a child, she was capable of taking on a spirit with no training whatsoever while resisting possession and communicating with it - a rare trait that set her towards the path of being a cleric when combined with her endless compassion.

However, this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight">Played Straight</a> again when Goku's quick adaptability and natural talent far surpasses any in his race, even the Saiyan prince <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivilegedRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivilegedRival">Vegeta</a>, to the point that his low power level compared to other Saiyans at the start of the series could easily be chalked up to him being raised on Earth and not fighting strong opponents like the other Saiyans.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman">Jaco the Galactic Patrolman</a></em>, Bulma had already surpassed her father at the age of five and single-handedly repaired an alien spacecraft in a matter of minutes.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Downplayed">Downplayed</a> example with Krillin. He never was as talented as Goku, who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Human Alien</a> from a fighting race, but compared to other humans he was an exceptionally strong child. He was able to survive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Master Roshi's training regimen</a> and would have been second only to Goku in the 21st Martial Arts Tournament if Master Roshi hadn't entered. He also learned the Kamehameha on the fly with no prior training at the age of sixteen when it took his master fifty years to developed it. The only things that really held Krillin back was his lack of self-esteem, which was an effect of the bullying he received from the monks at his former temple and his occasional bouts of arrogance.
</li><li> Son Gohan is a prime example, both physically and academically. He's smart enough to study advanced biology at age 4, builds an amphibious sandsurfer/boat a few months afterwards, and by the time he's 10 years old he has enough latent power to unleash the equivalent force of a <em>Supernova</em>.
</li><li> Vegeta's talent was so well known that Frieza immediately takes a liking to him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparingTheAces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparingTheAces">spares him specifically</a> when he destroys Planet Vegeta. After that, Frieza more or less raises him as one of his elite soldiers. In the Bardock Special, Vegeta is able to take on <em>six</em> Saibamen by himself with little trouble. Keep in mind, each one of those Saibamen are as strong as Raditz. It's been stated that even as a child he was one of the strongest Saiyans at the time.
</li><li> Frieza himself can count as well. The overwhelming power by which he became the Galactic Emperor? His power which only needed Super Saiyans to even scratch him? He was born as that, and he didn't train for a single day in his life. Still he gave a personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> to almost everyone (barring Goku and Trunks, the said Super Saiyans), before he made the fatal mistake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">killing Krillin</a>. He was outright born as a mutation among his strong race as well. Also counts as a Subversion, as if he DID focus on training like the other examples on this page, he would have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">near damn unstoppable</a>, with probably Super-Perfect Cell and even Buu (literal monsters), being either equal in power or weaker.
</li><li> Goten and Trunks. At the age of eight, Trunks is able to become a Super Saiyan, much sooner and more easily than Future Trunks, and Goten became a Super Saiyan at seven, making him the youngest Super Saiyan in history.

The FMA manga clarifies that automail "mechanics" are actually closer to surgeons then the people fixing your car.

And <em>neuro</em>-surgery at that, since they have to link up all the nerves.

</li><li> The classic psychological science fiction novel <em>In Hiding</em> by Wilmer Shiras is all about this. Following a vaguely described nuclear accident, many hyper-intelligent kids are born.

Since he refused to talk until age four, and refuses to talk to those who aren't family, he is labeled as "dumb" by the townsfolk. In reality, he's incredibly bright. His mother reads him medical journals as bedtime reading, and he is also able to decipher people's emotions. As a result, he has a hard time relating to his peers. When he does display his intelligence, he is told he is a liar or to stop showing off. He also has a problem with being bullied. However, he still shows signs of being a child; he is incredibly proud of his intelligence and thinks himself, at times, infallible. He is warned against it by the Ladies, though it eventually leads to his possession by IT.

The show notably flips the premise of <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>; where that show was about a normal person surrounded by genius geeks, <em>Young Sheldon</em> has Sheldon as the odd man out in an average-intelligence family, and mines comedy and drama from that. Sheldon is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> prone to talking down to his parents and teachers, with no qualms pointing out being above their intellectual level, while his parents fret about his social abilities and mental health, and his siblings sometimes feel insecure for not being as bright as Sheldon.

</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Shoken">Masako Ichijou aka Empress Haruko aka Empress Dowager Shoken<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, wife of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Emperor Mutsuhito aka Meiji</a>. She learned to read complicated poetry at age 4, started writing at age five, started reading Chinese at age 7, and by age 12 she was an expert koto player.
</li><li> While undoubtedly gifted, William James Sidis had a Make Your Child A Genius dad as well. No one knows how intelligent he really was because his parents tended to exaggerate. He entered Harvard at age 11, graduated at age 16 and later taught math there. His much-publicized "mental breakdown" may actually have been his parents' coverup for his Socialist activism, which had gotten him arrested on May Day 1919. Sidis' friend said "had one great cause  the right of an individual in this country to follow his chosen way of life".
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao">Terence Tao<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> started taking college-level math classes at 9 and received his bachelor's and master's degrees at 16. Breaking the mold of the burnt-out prodigy, he is still an active and notable mathematician in his forties and appears to have a happy family life.
</li><li> Jazz pianist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArtTatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArtTatum">Art Tatum</a> learned to play church hymns and piano rolls at 3. Rumors would circulate that he played piano rolls meant for two people (and he was blind).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgPhilippTelemann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgPhilippTelemann">Georg Philipp Telemann</a>: Despite being discouraged from music by his family (because music was then considered neither a really honorable trade nor a lucrative one), he taught himself to play the violin, recorder and piano as a child. Composed his first pieces of music as a ten-year-old, at which age he already started to substitute for the cantor teaching the upper classes of his school. Composed his first opera, <em>Sigismundus</em>, at age twelve, after which his mother confiscated his musical instruments and sent him to a school in another town in a vain attempt to stop him from "wasting his time" on music. "Unfortunately" young Telemann was encouraged in his musical endeavours there by the local church superintendent.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://heuna.tumblr.com/post/2415073898/kim-ung-yong-&lt;!--EA--&gt;B9%80&lt;!--EA--&gt;9B%85&lt;!--EA--&gt;9A%A9-a-child-prodigy-but-happiness">Kim Ung-Yong<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of South Korea was reported with an IQ of 210 in the mid-1960s. He was a guest student in physics at Hangyang University at three (both his parents were professors there) and appeared on Japan's "World Surprise Show" at four composing poetry, speaking four languages and solving integral calculus problems. NASA paid for him to attend Colorado State University and then hired him at age 11. He worked there until he was about 17, later saying it was monumentally boring and he missed his mother. He went home and changed fields entirely. Today he is a professor of civil engineering at a college near his hometown.
</li><li> Religious visions are also how <a class="urllink" href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=565&amp;q=Sulamith+Wulfing&amp;oq=Sulamith+Wulfing">Sulamith Wulfing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> got started, except she began at four and went to art school as a teenager. She was considered so gifted that the school interceded with German authorities to let her off mandatory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>-related service as a telephone switchboard operator so she could focus on her art.
</li><li> Sho Yano, who started university by age 9 and was in medical school and studying for a PhD on the side by age 12. According to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/ct-met-boy-wonder-20120603,0,7796464.story">news reports<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he was (deep breath....) reading by age 2, writing by age 3, composing music at age 5, scored 1500 on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SATs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SATs">SATs</a> (out of 1600) at age 8, entered college at age 9, entered medical school at age 12, finished his Ph.D. in three years, and in 2012 got his M.D. from the University of Chicago at age 21. His IQ is estimated at over 200. Oh, and he's also a concert pianist who's played at the Ravinia festival. And has a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. Do you have an inferiority complex yet?
</li><li> Austrian pediatrician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergersSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergersSyndrome">Hans Asperger</a> referred to the autistic children in his practice as "Little Professors".
</li><li> Educator Howard Spicker believed child geniuses, what he called "bright" children, were actually relatively common, but went unrecognized because they don't fit the profile of what people think a child prodigy should be like.
</li><li> A few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> grandmasters, specially world champions. Small example: Jose Raul Capablanca learned to play chess at the age of 4 and had beaten the Cuban national champion by the age of 12!
</li><li> The German word for this is of course <em>Wunderkind</em> ("miracle or wonder child"), which also entered the English language as a loanword. It was coined by philosopher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DichterAndDenker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DichterAndDenker">Immanuel Kant</a> with reference to Christian Heinrich Heineken of Lübeck (1721-1725), who had mastered French and Latin at age two and at age three wrote a history of Denmark, and for years lived mostly on the milk of his wetnurse. His death at age four is attributed to the then unknown Coeliac disease (he died when his diet switched to grain products like bread etc)
</li><li> Schoolteacher Benjamin Heath Malkin (1769-1842) of the Suffolk village of Bury St. Edmunds, an acquaintance of William Blake, was <em>accused</em> of force-educating his children when <a class="urllink" href="https://archive.org/details/fathersmemoirsof00malk">his five-year-old son Thomas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> died in 1806. Malkin homeschooled all his kids and by his account was less of a teacher than a referee. Thomas was your standard child prodigy who ran an imaginary country, Allestone (with maps) on the side. His death was prolonged and unpleasant. A doctor visited <em>the day after he died</em> to give Malkin a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> about Thomas having died of "brain fever" from overstudy, citing Thomas' "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBrainIsBig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBrainIsBig">large head</a>" as proof. Malkin actually had to request an autopsy to prove the cause of death was inflammatory bowel disease. As if to bear this out, Malkin's other kids were also child geniuses and had fine adult careers.
</li><li> Actress Amy Rutberg, best known for her role as Marci Stahl in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>, entered college at age 13 and transferred to UCLA as a Junior when she was just 15.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://i-lost-my-heart-in-republic-city.tumblr.com/post/185693983989/trans-jesus-uisce-bitch-im-so-proud">Daniel Liu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> started helping college students with their organic chemistry homework to attending to Achem, and is now a researcher at the University of Toeldo at 11.
