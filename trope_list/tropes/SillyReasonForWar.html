Like what pigment their skin has, whose parents they were born from, which phrases they pray with, what political party they support, and what gender they were born with. And the aliens killing each other over what color hat they wear are <em>far</em> above that kind of petty bickering.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a> Gorgeous</em>, heroes... er, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">protagonists</a></em> Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent find themselves caught in a civil war between a local lord and his daughter, who's raised an army and marched on the palace. Her reason for rebellion? She wants a bigger allowance.
<ul><li> And she already <em>gets</em> a pretty large one (which she is using to bankroll her rebellion - why her father is still paying her allowance while she's rebelling is never brought up), which is why her father is so worked up about her demands — a raise from from 50 gold a month to 200 gold a month is <em>not</em> chicken feed. Even Lina and Naga think her father is justified in being annoyed when they find out she wants quadruple her monthly allowance.
</li><li> And it also happens in <em>Slayers: Great</em>, where the father and son of a famous golem-making family, Galia and Huey, are fighting a personal battle that they eventually try to settle by building giant golems and having them fight each other. The reason: Galia is obsessed with making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kawaisa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Kawaisa">Kawaii</a> golems, to the extent he builds his mega-golem in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chibi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chibi">Chibi</a> Lina Inverse, even going so far as to spend time and effort causing it to make cute sound effects when it steps or does anything. Huey, on the other hand, is into ultra-realistic golems — and his favorite source material are beautiful, buxom women. His mega-golem is designed as a humungous statue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">Naga</a>, and he devotes effort to making sure the breasts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gainaxing">jiggle like hers</a>. When they finally reconcile, their first combined effort golem is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop">Betty Boop</a> reference; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> woman's face atop a realistically sculpted sexy woman's body.

Dorry and Broggy have been fighting (as in, straight-up brawling) each other for decades on end, such that they don't even remember what they were fighting for. The original dispute? <em>Who caught the bigger fish?</em> This is related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> and, again, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> trope, so their pride is respected in-universe even as the audience is expected to laugh at the cause for a decades-long bout between comrades.
</li><li> In most of the series in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, the only thing silly about the conflicts seems to be how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">the card game is used to dispute it.</a> The reason for the conflict itself is anything but silly. (In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> is trying to prevent a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>, threatening the lives of millions in the process; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh!

However, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em>, the card game <em>itself</em> is the focus of the conflict, where an inter-dimensional war has been started over <em>which Special Summoning technique is superior.</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, it was revealed to be a ploy created by the Professor to gather as many captured souls and use them to fuse the four dimensions.</span>
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em>, the <em>Aloha Oe</em> crew crash on a moon where war has raged for 10,000 years... over whether to wear undies or vests. The planet the moon belonged to was destroyed about 10,000 years ago and both sides are down to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">last of their kind</a>.

<ul><li> In the comic book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs">Smurf Versus Smurf</a></em>, a civil war erupts in the Smurf village over whether the word "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Smurfing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Smurfing">smurf</a>" should be used as an adjective (south end) or a verb (north end). This gets funnier in languages that allow for many composite words (e.g. Dutch and German) because now the war is about whether the proper term is "corksmurf" or "smurfscrew". As a whole, this was parodying the language divide issues in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belgium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belgium">Belgium</a>. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">animated series</a>, this led to the creation of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOlympics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOlympics">Smurfic Games</a>, thereby averting the war scenario.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicstrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicstrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em>, Elbonia erupted into civil war between the left-handed and right-handed people. Dilbert quickly lost patience trying to explain that it's "an arbitrary distinction." ("Geez, you lefties are thick. I'm glad <em>I'm</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">normal</a>.")
</li><li> During his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> rant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> remarks that the last world war was caused by a dispute over how many telegraph poles Germany owed as war reparations. Which, true or not, he evidently finds hilarious. While Germany having fallen in arrears in its delivery of telegraph poles did not cause a war, it was the reason given by France for occupying the Ruhr Valley in 1923. One British observer commented that this was the most devious use of wood since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">The Trojan War</a>.
</li><li> One of the earliest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> stories has Clark sent to cover a war in a small South American nation. After uncovering a corrupt weapon manufacturer and the US senator collaborating with him, Clark drags the opposing generals into the forest and demands they settle it by fisticuffs. The generals admit to having no clue what they're fighting about, and quickly make peace when Clark explains the whole war is a scam to sell armaments.
</li><li> In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">Homage</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss">Dr. Seuss</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders">The Defenders</a></em> once had an issue where the Defenders found themselves in a dimension with two lands named 'Here' and 'There' who were locked in a war.

<ul><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> novel, <em>Imzadi</em> mentions two feuding worlds whose centuries-long strife ultimately stemmed from the hard feelings caused by an unintentional diplomatic incident.

Since Imperial power is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> on Barrayar, and since terraforming a planet with almost no technology is <em>hard</em>, this war isn't that silly—but since the useful terraforming substance is <em>horse manure</em>, the whole thing sounds kind of ridiculous to most readers. The way Miles tells it in-story, it was the sort of war that underemployed minor aristocrats start whenever they have a cashflow problem or feel like expanding their territory and think they can get away with it, but it seems to have ground to a halt quite quickly when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Barrayaran</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Vor ruling class</a> became dimly aware it was a silly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar">Pretext for War</a> even by their standards.

Ostensibly, the war was for control of the constantly shifting iceberg masses that made up the only land surface on the planet. But since these icebergs are inevitably destroyed/melt as they move towards the equator, no victory ever means anything for more than a few months, but the war continues on and on, as both sides had grown to hate each other too much to admit the whole thing is pointless...

<ul><li> The war that nearly takes place in the book is over a small island with no usable resources, and no potential for any use economically or industrially, that suddenly pops up in the water between Ankh-Morpork and Klatch. While neither side actually wants the island, they don't want the other side to have it either, since both sides believe it belongs to them. Humorously, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the war is ultimately prevented when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Vetinari</a>, after visiting the island, surrenders it to Klatch because he had determined that the island will inevitably sink again, making it even more worthless than it already is</span>. This is a reference to an actual island between Sicily and Malta, called Ferdinandea by Italy, Julia Island by France, and Graham Island by the British. In mid-1831, the volcanic island emerged after an eruption, sparking a brief diplomatic row by the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, France, Britain, and Spain over who would claim the new island, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until the "island," actually made of weak <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tephra">tephra<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, washed away over the course of the next six months</span>. The Italians (or to be specific, the Sicilians) recently renewed their claims in 2000 by inviting the heir to the defunct Bourbon throne out for a ceremony to plant both a flag and a plaque on the summit, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by sending a diving team down</span>.
</li><li> There's also a story about two smaller nations nominally claimed by the Klatchian empire, who had only recently eased off on a centuries-old war, having run out of rocks to throw. The reason for the conflict is a one-word difference in their holy book, which one country translates as "man" and the other translates as "god". This trope is applicable because the difference between the two words, in Klatchian script, comes down to how a single dot is positioned over one letter ... and it <em>especially</em> applies if, as heretical theologians suggest, the dot is actually a bit of fly poo. Apparently if the dot was moved slightly more it would mean "licorice". This (well, the first part, not the licorice) is a reference to the split between the Eastern and Western Churches over a Greek word that could mean either 'of God' or 'of man' in the Nicaean Creed depending on if it differed by an iota (the smallest Greek letter). Hence the phrase 'not one iota of difference'.

The fact that the Duchess of Asturia and the Queen of Arendia were the <em>same person</em> was irrelevant.

As violence begins to erupt on the streets and even in his own home (between his hygienic son and his politically active, hairy, sweaty, and stinky brother-in-law), the main character refuses to take a side and can't understand why either side is taking the issue so seriously.

</div></li><li> Andre Maurios's children's book <em>Fattypuffs and Thinifers</em> is set in an underground world where people are divided according to their weight, which is deliberately stupid in the first place. When the book begins, they are in an uneasy truce in a war over something, which is never made clear, to do with an island in the sea between their countries. At a hopeful peace conference, the Fattypuffs insist on calling the island "Fattyfer", while the Thinifers demand it be called "Thinipuff".

No-one questions this enough to stop fighting in the original, but commentary from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides">Euripides</a> onwards pulled the thread of that logic, e.g.:
<div class="indent"><strong>Hector:</strong> She is not worth what she doth cost the keeping.
</div><ul><li> While it seems a silly reason now, it wasn't then. The men <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">were just keeping their oath</a>. Every man who wanted to be a suitor for Helen had to agree to abide by her father's decision and defend the right of the chosen husband should anyone try anything funny. Also, Menelaus inherited his throne via his marriage to Helen - if he doesn't get her back, he loses the right to rule.
</li><li> Also, Paris kidnapped Helen while being a guest at Menelaus' home, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">a breach of hospitality</a>. For most ancient societies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> (to the point that, in the Iliad, two warriors on opposing sides ditched the battle to celebrate upon learning <em>the grandfather of one of them had been guest of the grandfather of the other</em>), and a prince kidnapping a queen while being a guest was a perfectly acceptable reason for war. Menelaus declared war for <em>that</em> (and his right to rule, but would have done the same even if it didn't depend from Helen), Agamemnon joined him because it was his brother who had been besmirched by this breach, and the rest of the Greeks joined due their oath or because they were Agamemnon's subordinates.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herodotus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herodotus">Herodotus</a> cites this absurdity as evidence for a slightly different theory about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">The Trojan War</a>. Egyptian priests told Herodotus that Helen never made it to Troy, because she and Paris were shipwrecked in Egypt along the way, and the Egyptians decided to hold onto Helen for her husband until he came to get her. The Greeks think the Trojans are just lying when they say that Helen is not in Troy, hence the ten year war. Herodotus argues that this makes more sense than Homer's version, because the King of Troy "assuredly was not so mad, nor yet the others of his house, that they were desirous to run risk of ruin for themselves and their children and their city, in order that [Paris] might have Helen as his wife"
</li><li> Thersites, a commoner in the Mycenean army, calls Agamemnon out on this at one point, telling the Myceneans they should go home and let their king deal with his own problems, especially since the elites in the army help themselves to plunder and women captured by the common soldiers. Odysseus promptly beats Thersites with a staff for this, telling him that commoners need to shut up. At one point in the Iliad they even try it - Menelaus and Paris duel, with the winner getting Helen. Menelaus won, but then Aphrodite got a Trojan soldier to break the truce, restarting the war.
</li><li> To make it even worse, one version of Greek Myth claims that it was caused originally by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgementOfParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JudgementOfParis">vanity of three goddesses</a> (the winning goddess awarding Helen to Paris as a reward, neglecting to check whether or not Helen was married or even aware of the deal), which, in turn, was started by Eris, who was angry for not being invited to a party. In short, going by this story, the long, bloody conflict was started out of spite and jealousy.

<ul><li> The game encourages this when players need to justify why the Ultramarines and Salamanders, two indisputably good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> chapters in a setting filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>, are fighting each other. Obviously they were sent to retrieve a holy relic independently of each other or something like that, now roll to see who goes first.
</li><li> Something similar happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a>: Dark Crusade</em> campaign - both General Alexander's 1st Kronus Regiment and Brother-Captain Thule of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodRavens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodRavens">Blood Ravens</a> 4th Company are trying to liberate the planet Kronus for the Imperium. The problem is that Alexander refused Thule's order to evacuate his men (because the Blood Ravens are also after some chapter relics they want to keep secret), so the two end up clashing, which canonically ends with Alexander's retreat and Thule ordering the surviving Guardsmen shipped off to Segmentum command, with his compliments for following their orders. This move did not endear the Blood Ravens to Imperial Bureaucracy, coupled with their penchant for secrecy some organizations went so far as to call them heretics.
</li><li> At least Dark Crusade took some effort to justify the confrontation. Relics that could prove Blood Ravens are descended from a Traitor Legion have been found, while Alexandr could have been influenced by a daemon bound to Titan's cannon in his base. Soulstorm was worse: The plot sums up to Sisters (backed up by Inquisition) being self righteous zealots with no common or military sense whatsoever and Boreale being a complete idiot.
</li><li> In other bits of background fluff, this is why the Imperial Guard tries (unsuccessfully) to adopt a standardized uniform across the countless regiments raised from across the galaxy - there have been occasions when two loyalist forces ended up fighting because they looked so different, each assumed the other was the enemy (the "standard" green uniform is originally Cadian, with most regiments following their example).
</li><li> Orks (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Orcs</a>) don't really <em>need</em> any reason to kill their enemies (or each other) beyond boredom, but they're good at finding justifications. For example, the two Greenskin gods are Gork and Mork, one the god of brutal cunning (he hits you when you're not looking), the other of cunning brutality (he hits you <em>really</em> hard even when you are looking). The question of which is which regularly leads to a happy round of religious warfare, at least until the Greenskins find something more interesting to fight.
</li><li> The backstory of the late 90's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame">spin-off game</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Gorkamorka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Gorkamorka">Gorkamorka</a></em> involved a load of Orks stranded on a desert planet after their ship crash-landed. Repairs slowed as a civil war spread over which deity the vessel better resembled, to the point that the ship was destroyed. Afterward the name <em>Gorkamorka</em> was chosen as a compromise, and reconstruction nominally continued, though the "Gorkers" and "Morkers" kept fighting. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> in any other universe, but here, it just kind of makes sense. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Oh, and the world they landed on is strongly hinted to be a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Necron Tomb World</a>.

If they fail, they have a 1 in 6 chance of attacking the nearest friendly unit, a 1 in 6 chance of charging the nearest enemy unit, and a 4 in 6 chance of basically grinding their advance to a halt as they start bashing each other out of boredom. They'll even do this despite having a Black Orc Boss or Warboss in the unit... who will basically kill any troublemakers the first time they start punching each other up. And they can potentially go right back to doing this even after he cracks some heads together!
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</a></em>, Orcs have a special rule that requires them to make a willpower check to <em>avoid</em> picking a fight with the nearest Orc if given the slightest provocation to do so — with exceptions if any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Black Orcs</a> are nearby or the orc is already in melee with someone.
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk">Bretonnian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AristocratsAreEvil">nobles</a> are noted to be notoriously thin-skinned and will war with each other for the silliest of reasons (such as an flippant insult) if not restrained by their liege lords. This is especially true in regions of Brettonia where there are no orcs or beastmen to fight. In fact, one particular pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a> are still going at it over an alleged ravishing that happened several hundred years ago (if it happened at all) and which both sides claim to be the victimized party in. The feud is so formalized the time and place of any battles are agreed upon in advance, fought according to a timetable, and are apparently a great spectator sport for neighbouring nobility and peasants.
</li><li> Dwarfs maintain the Book of Grudges, which lists every single slight against their race (Including any perceived slights incurred while settling an existing grudge, and any slights incurred while settling <em>that</em> grudge, ad infinitum), and are grimly dedicated to settling accounts by blood or compensation. This could very well mean that an army of Dwarfs will attack your keep because your great-great-grandfather uttered an ill-timed short joke. A <em>White Dwarf</em> battle report featured a Dwarf king leading a bloody siege against an Imperial noble because of his horrible betrayal of the Dwarf engineers who helped build the castle - the noble shortchanged them by twelve gold crowns. The hardcover Empire army book for 8th edition mentions a similar event happening in 2410, when dwarfs raze Fortress Kreighof to the ground after realising their payment was two and a half pennies short of the twelve dozen wagonloads of gold they had been given.
<ul><li> Though the empire-shattering war between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVsDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVsDwarves">High Elves and Dwarfs</a> might have been inevitable, and the main cause was a Dark Elven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">false flag operation</a> that attacked a Dwarf caravan, it could have been avoided had the High Elven King not ordered that the Dwarf ambassador be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticHaircut">shaved</a> and sent home in disgrace. The Dwarfs refer to the ensuing conflict as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">War of Vengeance</a>, while the Elves call it the War of the Beard.
</li></ul></li><li> The hardcover Tomb Kings army book for 8th edition mentions the ongoing (it started in 210, Imperial Calender, so it's been raging for over <em>2300 years</em>) "War of the Hammer", between dwarfs and the undead legions of King Alkharad. The cause? The Hammer of Algrim, an ancient dwarf-forged weapon. Problem is that it contains, as its centerpiece, a bronze coin minted for King Alkhared before the fall of Nehekhara. The dwarfs won't give it up because it was forged by a dwarf; the Tomb King refuses to lose one of his coins.
<ul><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix">Gotrek &amp; Felix</a></em> books the pair are temporarily allied with a Tomb Prince in service to Alkhared's dynasty, and it turns out he and Gotrek had previously fought on opposite sides of one of these battles. When Felix asks why they don't just take the coin off the hammer and each take the part they actually care about, both act as if he's a complete idiot. In the end of the story they duel for the hammer, mostly just for the fun of it.

When introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em>, it was a combination of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">Order Versus Chaos</a>: a pointlessly bloody war over which of their specific takes on evil was superior, played for a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> and bleakness. It was also being deliberately encouraged by both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil">Neutral Evil</a> Yugoloths (who were profiting off of both sides) and by the denizens of the Upper Planes (who <em>really</em> didn't enjoy the prospect of the combatants deciding to attack them instead). In subsequent editions, the Blood War slowly began to stray away from this pointless nature. In particular, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/NentirVale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/NentirVale">World Axis version</a> released as part of 4th edition, it actually became a multi-layered conflict: ostensibly, the root cause was over the Heart of the Abyss, the ultimate embodiment of evil that created all of demonkind and one small shard of which, when stolen by Asmodeus the first devil, allowed him to kill his godly master and become a god instead. On a deeper level, the conflict was because devils are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angels</a> who seek to conquer the multiverse, whilst demons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment">Elemental Embodiments</a> of corruption and evil that seek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">to annihilate everything</a>, making them fundamentally opposed. Finally, the Blood War was a handy way for the demons to both organize themselves by focusing on a specific target <em>and</em> also gave them some protective cover, since the various other factions of the multiverse would ignore them so long as they were fighting with the devils — not realizing how much headway this was giving the demons.

The 'Diplomatic Insult' casus belli can be used to attack a nation that has recently insulted you (over border disputes, recent aggression against their neighbors, buttering toast on the wrong side...)

On the surface, the Civil War is about religious freedom, the Empire having signed a treaty with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Thalmor</a> outlawing the worship of Talos. The Stormcloaks accuse the Empire of being oppressive elven puppets, and the Empire accuses the Stormcloaks of being racist traitors. The thing is, the Empire never really enforced the Talos ban except in the most flagrantly public cases, and before the Civil War just about every home in Skyrim had a shrine to Talos so they could worship in private. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">EVERYONE hates the Thalmor</a>. So in practice, the war is between those who want to worship Talos openly and make war on the elves now, and those who want to worship Talos in private until the Empire has the strength to fight the elves later. To make things even worse, some characters imply that the late High King Torygg may very well have agreed with Stormcloak leader Ulfric about openly defying the Talos ban, if Ulfric had just asked him instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">Shouting</a> at him until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">his head exploded</a>.

<ul><li> In one episode they did it, not for war but for religion. Flanders explains that the bad blood between their religion (The Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism) and Catholicism goes back to when the former split off from the Catholic Church over the right to attend services with wet hair... which they've since abolished.

A thousand years into the future, Bart is considered the last prophet of God and two factions are at war over whether Bart's teachings were about love and tolerance, or understanding and peace.

<ul><li> But it gets worse. In a deleted scene from "Hunter's Moon: Part Two", the leader of the latest generation of Hunters confesses to Elisa that no one in his family remembers how or why the hunt began either, meaning they are, in truth, doing it for nothing. But it <em>still</em> gets worse. While the Hunters hate Gargoyles in general, their true goal is to slay Demona, and they don't know that they <em>can't</em>. Due to the bond she shares with Macbeth, only <em>he</em> can kill her. Thus, for ten centuries, they've been pursuing a meaningless and <em>pointless</em> goal, which they have no hope of ever achieving.

Note: While many of these wars were <em>triggered</em> by ridiculous things, they are often the culmination of larger tensions between two enemy states that may go back for generations.
<p></p><ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Pastry War</a> of 1838. A Franco-Mexican war that expanded to include Great Britain and United States. During the course of the conflict, France captured almost the entire Mexican fleet, the Republic of Texas moved further into the orbit of the USA, and former Mexican dictator Santa Anna was wounded in a clash with Mexican soldiers, paving the way for him to return to power. In the end, the British intervened and forced Mexico to pay France the 600,000 pesos compensation that France had demanded in the first place. Compensation for what, you may ask? The property of a French baker in Mexico having been damaged by Mexican army officers, <em>10 years previously</em>.
</li><li> The Nika Riots of 532 AD, when supporters of two rival teams of chariot racing (supported by two different Christian sects) broke out in fighting that ended up snowballing into riots that burned half the city of Constantinople <em>and</em> a full-fledged coup attempt, and resulted in the deaths of thousands massacred by the professional army. Chariot racing was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> — it was closely tied to Imperial politics and the legal system to such an extent that toughs representing a team that was in favor often had nothing to fear from law enforcement, almost regardless of what they did.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W12vb_Crf00">"The Football War"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a brief four-day war between El Salvador and Honduras in 1969 that started with a soccer riot. 3000 people (soldiers and civilians) died and 300,000 people were displaced. However, this is more a case of the riot lighting the fuse on existing tensions than actually going to war over the match.
</li><li> In the Han dynasty, a brief war erupted between the nobles of the royal family due to a game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Go" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Go">weiqi</a>: the losing royal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">pitched a fit</a> and beaned his playing buddy to death with the board; the grieving father blamed the other boy's father for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">terrible host</a> and attacked.
</li><li> By some accounts, the rebellion of William Wallace began because some English soldiers tried to steal his fish and he killed some of them, so they put a warrant out for his arrest. And his wife was killed for hiding him, which is why he went to the nearby fort and burned it down.
</li><li> In 1325, Italy was still divided into city-states. A regiment of soldiers from the city-state of Modena invaded Bologna to steal a brown, oak bucket. During the raid, several <em>hundred</em> Bolognese citizens were killed by the Modenese troops. The ensuing war lasted 12 years. Modena won, and still has the bucket. It's still on display in Modena's cathedral tower, the "Ghirlandina". Here's <a class="urllink" href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/176/465245775_cf388f5fc9_z.jpg">a photo.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
<ul><li> The true reason for the battle of Zappolino was the control of the region during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">war between Guelphs and Ghibellines</a> (which definitely counts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>) and the bucket was taken as a mock trophy when the battle, although bloody, ended in the stalemate. This is also exactly the reason that a large battle (comparable with battles of Agincourt or Tannenberg numbers-wise) is largely unknown and usually mentioned only in reference to the mock-heroic poem written three centuries later.
</li></ul></li><li> Downplayed in 1859 with "the Pig War", when an American farmer on the San Juan Islands near Vancouver, Canada, disputed between the US and Britain (The most recent treaty between the US and UK regarding that region clearly marked the border between America and Canada on the mainland, but was vague as to who owned which coastal islands near said border, and where the territorial waters of the islands owned by one side ended and the territorial waters of the islands owned by the other side began), killed a British-owned pig rooting in his garden. British authorities tried to arrest the farmer, and the American community on the islands called for US protection. When both sides realized that it was insane to "involve two great nations in a war over a squabble about a pig," in the words of the British commander on the scene, they set up a joint military presence and called in German mediation. (Which eventually decided in favor of the Americans.)
</li><li> In 1900, in what is now Ghana, a war broke out between the British and Ashanti Empires over a golden stool. To the Ashanti, the golden stool was an object of immense cultural and spiritual significance, representing the souls of all Ashanti, dead, living, and unborn. The British governor, Frederick Hodgson, was unaware of this, believing it was simply a throne, and rather unfortunately demanded the Ashanti hand it over so that he could sit on it. The result: the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Golden_Stool">War of the Golden Stool<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>—3,000 deaths, the dissolution of the Ashanti Empire, and the British never found the stool. The Ashanti to this day consider it a win, since their objective has been fulfilled—Hodgson never sat on it. In fact, the Ashanti would have been happy, since they had already been defeated by the British in another war, for <em>Queen Victoria</em> to sit on the stool, seeing as she was ruler of the British Empire and someone they saw as an equal and victor. Hodgson? Not so much...
</li><li> The Spartans liked to take this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">one step further</a> by going to war for <em>no reason at all.</em> At one point, according to Xenophon, they attacked the city state of Elis, literally and entirely "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">because they had no one else to fight at the time</a>." The Spartans also routinely declared war on their own slave population on the flimsiest of pretenses as part military exercise and part population control.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute">The Macedonia naming dispute.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Now, none of those countries have openly declared they want each other's territories (although Greece is afraid of an implied Macedonian expansion). This is more the political equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a>. It was eventually resolved by the Republic of Macedonia officially changing its name to the Republic of North Macedonia (the treaty was signed in 2018 and legal enforcement of this went into effect in 2019).
</li><li> Originally, the pre-conquest Mesoamericans had a general agreement to not begin a war until a messenger had been sent to the enemy and announced the reason why war was being declared. This worked just fine for a time, but after the Aztecs and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">desperate</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatStillMyheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatStillMyheart">need</a> for war prisoners came to power, wars began to be declared so often that they soon ran out of good excuses, and the reasons became increasingly sillier. For example, in 1473 the Aztec emperor declared war on the king of Tlatelolco (who was his brother-in-law) because he didn't sleep with his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">often enough</a> and that made her sad — the king was thrown off Tlatelolco's main temple and his state annexed to the Aztec Empire. It's safe to assume that everybody else eventually ran out of excuses too, because by the time the Spanish showed up, all the surviving states had agreed to have some limited wars with each other each few years, the "flowery wars", with no single purpose but to provide sacrifice victims to everybody.

</li></ul></li><li> One of the many incidents over Chaco in South America was inflamed by a postage stamp showing it as part of Paraguay.
</li><li> Following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, relations between Greece and Bulgaria were rather strained. One day, a dog ran away from his owner in Greece over the border into Bulgaria, and his owner, a soldier, ran after him. The soldier was shot dead by Bulgarian sentries. The resulting war was called "The War of the Stray Dog."
</li><li> In 1976, Operation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Paul Bunyan</a> was started because two US Army officers were killed. This operation included two eight-man tree-trimming squads backed up by three platoons of soldiers with a supporting company waiting in helicopters. This was further backed up by major air support including an aircraft carrier. The reason? They were chopping down a tree in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Granted, South Korea and North Korea had quite a lot of tension between them, this was supposedly a scheduled trimming. Note that the high level of military force was intended as a deterrent to prevent a more serious conflict from erupting. This wasn't quite as silly as it initially seems. A previous work detail of two men and no back-up had been sent out to chop down the tree, which was blocking the view of a South Korean observation post, when they were attacked and killed by DPRK troops. The massive show of force was to both protect the tree-trimmers and to basically <em>dare</em> the North Koreans to mess with them a second time.
</li><li> The War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748): Britain was looking for an excuse to go to war with Spain, and someone eventually pointed out that <em>eight years earlier</em>, Spanish coast guards had boarded an English ship, captained by the aforementioned Jenkins, and cut off his ear. Parliament was duly outraged and war was declared. Unlike some of the other examples of this list, this one was not a minor skirmish; it wound up involving the <em>second largest ever</em> amphibious assault (it remained <em>the</em> largest until the WWII Normandy Landings) and involved a stunning level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> for all of its duration - down to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetUsNeverSpeakOfThisAgain">royal command from the loser of the largest battle to never mention it again (order which was still in effect well into the XX century)</a> that <em>almost</em> makes us forget that literally <em>tens of thousands</em> of British and Spanish soldiers died in it. The war was eventually subsumed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheAustrianSuccession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheAustrianSuccession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>, an all-European conflict that began when Prussia invaded Austrian Silesia in 1740. To further highlight the pointlessness of the conflict, there's even considerable doubt about whether or not some guy named Jenkins really lost an ear that way in the first place.
</li><li> The Dog Tax War, the last of the Maori wars fought in 1898. The Hokianga County Council in New Zealand introduced a tax of 2/6d on dogs, the local Maori rose in armed protest and a short military campaign was fought. The war was bloodless and the upshot was the dog tax stayed.
</li><li> In 1870, the throne of Spain was offered to a prince from a Catholic side-branch of the ruling house of Prussia. The French government vehemently objected, so the Prussian prince withdrew his candidacy. Then the French government demanded that Prussian king never allow such an offer to occur again. Prussia refused. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrancoPrussianWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrancoPrussianWar">The French declared war on Prussia (despite Prussia's bigger army), which led all the other German states to declare war on France.</a> The Germans quickly defeated the French, taking Alsace-Lorraine. The festering dispute over Alsace-Lorraine helped cause both world wars. Both the Prussian king and the French emperor Napoleon III (nephew of the first) realized it was a really silly pretext for war and were slowly backing down, but Bismarck, who wanted a war to kickstart the German unification, published part of their messages, enflaming German public opinion over the perceived harsh language (thanks to Bismarck's cautious editing of what got published). That in turn enflamed <em>French</em> public opinion because they thought it was a perfectly legitimate request (even though France had had no problems prevailing when the Habsburgs had ruled over Germany and Spain at the same time), who forced the government to declare war. Napoleon III is recalled complaining about this a few days before he had to sign the declaration.
<ul><li> On the backdrop of that war, the final act of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfItalianIndependence">Wars of Italian Independence</a>, the Italian conquest of Rome and the consequent dissolution of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePapalStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePapalStates">The Papal States</a>, took place for a very simple reason: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">the Italians as a people are fixated with Ancient Rome</a>, to the point that a unified Italian state that has the capital anywhere else in time <em>loses legitimacy</em>. Thus the House of Savoy and their ministers tried to secure Rome peacefully even before they managed to proclaim the Kingdom of Italy, after which they had to ignore Pope Pius IX's continuous provocations while using the French protection of the Pope as a reason to do so... Then France had to recall the garrison due the losses suffered in the war against Prussia just as Pius IX was using the First Vatican Council for yet another provocation, at which point, after one last attempt to secure Rome peacefully, Italy invaded with overwhelming force, surprising the international community with the obsession in putting their capital there.
</li><li> And on the opposing side, one of the reasons for Pius IX' hostility to the Italian independence and unification movement was that, under the Holy Roman Empire, it was the Pope's prerogative to appoint the King of Italy (and, by extension, the Holy Roman Emperor, but the Italian patriots weren't interested in that), and the Italian patriots <em>hadn't asked his permission</em>. The Count of Cavour, the prime minister for the Kingdom of Sardinia that was leading the unification, tried to get around this by forming a confederation of three kingdoms where the Pope would have been <em>primus inter pares</em> with the King of Northern Italy (of the House of Savoy, formerly King of Sardinia) and the King of Southern Italy (of the House of Borbone, formerly King of the Two Sicilies), but Pius IX refused to recognize them as his peers, resulting in Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies calling himself out of the unification movement to not go against the Pope-and the enduring hostility between Pius IX and the Kingdom of Sardinia first and the Kingdom of Italy later.

</li><li> Although it has not escalated to military conflict, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sudan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sudan">Sudan</a> have a long-standing border dispute over an area called Bir Tawil — specifically, they each allege that the <em>other</em> party owns it. The reason for the dispute is that each nation claims a different historical border to be the correct boundary between their nations (each of them favouring a border that includes <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halaib_Triangle">a much more valuable piece of land<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> within their nation—currently administered <em>de facto</em> by Egypt),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zpgp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0zpgp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zpgp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is one of the major reasons Egypt and Sudan will probably <em>never</em> fight over this border dispute. The reasons this dispute is unlikely to lead to war are that (1) thhey are strategic allies (they have strong economic links and share a common interest in preventing countries upstream of them on the Nile—particularly Ethiopia—from messing with the amount of water that flows down to them), (2) they have strong cultural links (beyond both being Arabic-speaking countries, they share many cultural traits in common not shared with other Arab states), and (3) Egypt is <em>much</em> stronger (with a far larger population and far more developed economy) and has a far stronger military than Sudan. Number 3 means that so long as Egypt has actual control of the land both countries actually want, Egypt has no reason to attack Sudan, and Sudan knows it would get its ass beat if it tried to take the territory by force.</span> and both of their preferred borders exclude Bir Tawil from their nation. Thus, even if the other side doesn't want it, one side can't simply claim that territory as their own since it would be implicitly giving up the territory they actually want. While the countries have never fought over it, Egypt has sent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EgyptiansWithEagleFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EgyptiansWithEagleFighters">its army</a> to the territory a few times, most recently in 1992 (leading to the current situation of it being a <em>de facto</em> part of Egypt; before then, the territory was usually a <em>de facto</em> Egyptian-Sudanese condominium).
<ul><li> Which led to the amusing happening of an American man flying there, planting a homemade flag, and declaring it as the "Kingdom of Northern Sudan". Just so his daughter could be a princess.

After Google Maps erroneously portrayed Costa Rica's border with Nicaragua south of the accepted line, they sent 50 soldiers to the Isla Portillos in Costa Rica, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">justifying it by saying that, according to Google Maps, it was a part of Nicaragua</a>. Costa Rica responded by sending 70 police officers to the island (as they do not have a real military). It ended with Google Maps correcting the error, and the UN ruling that technically, Nicaragua invaded Costa Rica.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TimurTheLame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TimurTheLame">Timur the Lame</a> once attacked India as part of his conquest campaigns because he felt the local rulers were growing <em>too tolerant of the Hindu population</em>. On the topic of India, the Sepoy Mutiny was started because the British made packages of gunpowder, lubricated by either pork, beef, or lamb tallow but nobody could tell which was which. More on this <a class="urllink" href="https://www.guns.com/2013/01/19/how-gun-lube-brought-down-the-british-empire/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. You see, a nation filled with Hindus (believe cattle are part of the divine) and Muslims (believe pigs are unclean), forced to open a package that has a 1 in 3 chance of being exactly what they can't touch, and get this, they have to open it with their mouth.
</li><li> In Australia, to curb bird overpopulation messing with the crops, the military actually <a class="urllink" href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/great-emu-war">declared war on emus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The birds, despite having no opposable thumbs, were extremely effective in scatter maneuvers, and the army quickly wasted huge amounts of ammunition. They tried ambushes, actual military campaigns, and even driving around with a machine gun mounted to a jeep. Ultimately, they declared the war a loss.
