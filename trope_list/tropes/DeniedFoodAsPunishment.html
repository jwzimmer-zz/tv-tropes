What's the best course of action to take? Why, punish them by depriving them of either breakfast, lunch, dinner, or all three meals together, of course! Likely to involve the following variations:
</p><p></p><ul><li> The character is not allowed any food <em>at all</em> and, in extreme cases, may also be denied anything to drink.
</li><li> The character is allowed to eat, but is given less food than everyone else. At the extreme end, this can involve them being given barely enough to keep them alive.
</li><li> The character is allowed to eat and is given a normal-sized portion, but is denied a food which they particularly like and/or which is commonly regarded as a treat.
</li></ul><p>At one time this was a fairly common punishment for disobedient children in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. These days it's generally considered abusive to actually starve your kids, although the third type above is still reasonably acceptable.

(The exact opposite punishment is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFeeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFeeding">Force Feeding</a>.) And, of course, servants may be threatened with this by their masters in order to keep them in line.
</p><p>In a few instances, either the character will try to sneak some food when they think no one is looking, or another character will try to sneak them food. Of course, if the character who imposed the punishment is smart, they are likely to take steps to prevent this.
</p><p>One of the earliest examples of this trope is the Greek myth of Tantalos, making this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. After feeling jilted by the gods, Tantalus invited them over for a meal at his palace, where he fed his own children to them as revenge. Disgusted, the gods sent him to eternal punishment in the underworld. He would stand in a pool of water with a grape vine overhead — but whenever he tried to drink or eat, the water and grapes would move beyond his reach, making him suffer eternal of thirst and hunger (hence, the word "tantalize").

</p><p>Sometimes done if a character is enduring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CinderellaCircumstances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CinderellaCircumstances">Cinderella Circumstances</a>. May overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyEatsYourLunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyEatsYourLunch">Enemy Eats Your Lunch</a> if the punishment involves the character having to watch what would have been their share being eaten by others. Also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostFoodGrievance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostFoodGrievance">Lost Food Grievance</a> for when a character reacts poorly to this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreensPrecedeSweets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreensPrecedeSweets">Greens Precede Sweets</a>, which may overlap with the third variation, is for when a character is told they will not be allowed dessert unless they finish their vegetables.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, Crona is denied food from Medusa after refusing to kill three rabbits, in different ways. This continues over and over until he/she finally agrees to it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Inverted later, when Medusa not only feeds Crona lavishly but gives them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourFavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourFavorite">Your Favorite</a>... as a way to make them snap and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfmadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfmadeOrphan">kill her</a> as a part of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">Thanatos Gambit</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em>, the three Great Gourmet Prisons hold the most ruthless and destructive criminals sentenced for life and beasts deemed too dangerous for the human world. Honey Prison is divided up into eight levels of food-themed torture. Inmates of the third level and beyond it are denied any food. Beyond the fourth level they no longer receive water. This trope is to be expected for such a utterly food obsessed show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>: Louise punished her familiar Saito like this whenever he roused her temper, which was often, and also threatened to take away his meals as a way to prevent him from disobeying her orders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em>: The failure of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">Operation High Tension Syndrome</a> results in this, and the starvation period is a <em>week</em>, even the strongest of SSS died, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">but they should be fine</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Navy (and Koby, who had just been accepted as a recruit), salute Luffy and Zoro as they sail off. One of them decides, "As punishment, no dinner for a week!" because they allowed pirates to escape.
</li><li> Earlier, Zoro agreed to the terms Helmeppo set that he would starve for a month to protect a little girl.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, in which Kakashi holds a "bell test" for the three members of his team, with the one who doesn't get a bell being tied to the stump, denied lunch, and sent back to the academy. The trick is to work together in spite of the circumstances, but none of the three realize this, and Naruto tries to cheat, but gets tied to the stump for trying this. Kakashi then tells them that he'll give them another chance if Sakura and Sasuke don't feed Naruto, but when they do, he reveals that this test shows that the rules are less important than teamwork, and passes all three.
</li><li> Madame St. Paul, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Picolet Chardin III's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">instructor</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, forbids Ranma from eating "ungracefully" —that is, using her hands. The Chardin Family school of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts">Martial Arts Dining</a> thinks it demeaning to a) use your hands to eat, and b) to be <em>seen</em> eating, hence why they use their chameleon-like tongues to eat food in the blink of an eye. If Ranma can't do that, then he isn't allowed to eat <em>anything</em> until she learns. Then Ranma undergoes a severe training regimen, and turns down Akane's offers for food on the grounds that it would be admitting defeat. He nearly starves to death.
<ul><li> Fortunately for Ranma, his father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">never did this to him as a kid</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">He just stole food from Ranma and ate it himself if Ranma wasn't able to beat him up for trying or, presumably, sneaky enough to hide it from him.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliceAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AliceAcademy">Alice Academy</a></em>, no-star students (who are generally misbehaved) are given a measly portion of food, where 3-star students are treated to an extravagant feast.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em> Yuno had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">control-freak parents</a> who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> measured everything she did from how many hours she got to sleep to how many calories she had a day</span>. They also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kept her in a cage and starved her in an effort to raise her to be a model person.</span> All of this causes her to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ultimately snap on them, lock them in the same cage, and starve them to death.</span>
</li><li> Taken to a new level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpeedGrapher">Speed Grapher</a></em>, where Kagura Tennozou goes to school with empty lunch boxes thanks to her abusive mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Shinsen</a>, and collapses of hunger at least once.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother">Austria</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> was a very strict father figure towards Chibitalia, and one of the punishments for his mess-ups was this.
</li><li> Occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KazeToKiNoUta">Kaze to Ki no Uta</a></em> after a teacher discovers students having a fight and making a mess in a room.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Yumeria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Yumeria">Yumeria</a></em>, Tomokazu is denied dinner after making Mone cry, even though he apologized.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nichijou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nichijou">Nichijou</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Nano</a> often threatens this to the professor, a very young child who created her, due to her experiments or attempts to blame their talking cat, Sakamoto. It doesn't work very well however, as Nano either forgets about the punishment, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">forgives</a> her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei">Sekirei</a></em>, Miya often threatens to do this to Seo, especially if he refuses to help the main characters. She will also sometimes use this threat on Matsu when the latter is getting a little too friendly with Minato, and by extension, Minato, even though he's completely innocent in those cases.
</li><li> In episode 10 of Season 2's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Miu</a> does technically feed Kenichi when Renka shows up at the dojo. However, she gives him a very tiny fish compared to the giant ones the other characters received, and when he asks for seconds on rice, Miu gives him exactly one grain of rice. Renka offering to feed him her share of food only serves to frustrate Miu, while Kenichi's masters giggle at his misfortune with the two ladies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Kukaku gives Ichigo and Ganju this punishment in episode 24.
</li><li> A slight variation of this trope occurs in episode 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EngagedToTheUnidentified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EngagedToTheUnidentified">Engaged to the Unidentified</a></em>. After Mashiro teases her future sister-in-law Kobeni about her brother (and Kobeni's fiance) Hakuya, the latter decides that dinner that night would consist of all the foods the former hates, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam">natto, or sticky beans.</a> Since Kobeni is the only person in their house that can cook, Mashiro immediately apologizes to her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ABridesStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ABridesStory">A Bride's Story</a></em>, Seleke denies her son Rostem dinner until he finishes his chores, which would take until quite late. His aunt Amir sneaks him some food and helps him with the chores, saying she'll only do it this once. When Rostem slacks off again, Amir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">sticks firmly by "only once"</a> and Seleke panics at the thought of the kid starving.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> this is implied to have happened to Kosuke Kiryu/Kalin Kessler.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild">Cheerful Child</a> Atra turns out to have been an orphan who worked in a brothel (she's not even 10 at this point) as a chore-girl. They denied her food and bullied her to the point she ran away and risked death before finding someone else to take her in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>: Kaneki's father died when he was only four, leaving only books to remember him by. His mother, whom he repeatedly refers to as kind and a wonderful person, beat him as a child before working herself to death to support herself, her sister, and her son when Kaneki was ten.

In the beginning at least, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and she doesn't actually marry the prince considering how he turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharmless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinceCharmless">Prince Charmless</a></span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EllaEnchanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EllaEnchanted">Ella Enchanted</a></em>, after Ella talks back to her teacher Sewing Mistress, the lady punishes Ella by making her skip both dinner that night and breakfast the next morning. Made even worse by the fact that Hattie, who is traveling with Ella in the coach to finishing school, commands Ella to not eat; by the time they actually get to the school, Ella hasn't eaten for days. Areida smuggles her a bit of bread, thus cementing their friendship.

A case of a punishment that fits the crime, as they were already nearly starving in poverty and the cow was all they had left to sell for food money.

<ul><li> In one scene, the teacher bans both Sara and the girl she uses as a slave from having any meals the following day after they let the other girls into their bedroom (they are forbidden from doing so).

It's noted in <em>Deathly Hallows</em> that this was often to the point of near <em>starvation</em>.
<div class="indent">Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, "Go—cupboard—stay—no meals," before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.
</div></li><li> In <em>Mount Vernon Love Story</em>, Martha Washington halfheartedly tries this, sending her son to bed without dinner after he pulls a prank that has the entire neighborhood searching for him — but still leaving him an elaborate tray of bread, jam, and milk, just in case he gets <em>too</em> hungry. It's still a great concession for her, as she mostly lets him run wild, since his two older siblings have already died, and his younger sister is sickly. For his part, George (yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">that one</a>) comes up to his room and asks Jacky to go ahead and punish himself, since his mother won't.

</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Furnace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Furnace">Furnace</a>: Lockdown</em>, the teenage inmates are denied access to the dining hall as punishment for rioting.

His mother (the children's grandmother) slips him a muffin later, implying that she also mitigates the children's punishments in this way.
</li><li> Sometimes done with hares in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em> series, usually for having eaten too much food in the first place. This rarely ends well. Also seen sometimes with slaves in the series.
<ul><li> This actually nearly got a character <em>killed</em> in <em>Triss</em>. After the hare in question (who had already been in trouble twice for eating food that belonged to other people) eats a trifle that the Dibbuns were supposed to get as a prize for winning a contest, the abbot makes him clean the abbey from top to bottom, with only lettuce and water for food. The hare then loads up a haversack full to bursting with food, and leaves. He then gets caught by the villains and has to be rescued.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Malevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Malevil">Malevil</a></em>, this is the favorite punishment of the evil priest Fulbert, especially as he tricked the town into letting him watch the food supplies after the Apocalypse.

Robinton justifies refusing the healer near Meron because he said Robinton could do "nothing to him." And that is what Robinton gives the man.

Even though she has a good reason for being late, her father still punishes her by sending her to her room without dinner. Later, he comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporalPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporalPunishment">"correct her"</a> before locking her in her room to keep her from stealing food in the night.

She's not given any food during this time and is near starvation when her aunt comes home and is allowed to give her some soup.
</li><li> Enid Blyton's many stories for children sometimes use this: authority figures like parents sometimes routinely deny a misbehaving child their dinner, sometimes combining this with locking them in their bedroom for the day or night. In the fourth Famous Five novel, "Five Go to Smuggler's Top", the Five are staying with a friend at the eerie eponymous old mansion (Timmy the dog in hiding, as he was forbidden from Smuggler's Top), and the unpleasant deaf servant Block punishes George by locking her in her room and serving her only bread and water, which she throws back in his face defiantly. He is literally deaf to any objections to the way he punishes her<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (except that it turns out he isn't really deaf, but pretends to be in order to overhear things not meant for him to hear)</span>. It is up to George's cousins to smuggle food in to her through the window, and much of consequence in the later parts of the plot flows from this.

While in e.g. GULAGs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">Nazi concentration camps</a> this was played straight, in the British concentration camps (from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSecondBoerWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSecondBoerWar">The Second Boer War</a> — some of the earliest concentration camps), where mainly Boer civilians were kept, many starved to death because most of the time there simply wasn't enough foodstuff to go around — or rather, the foodstuff existed somewhere in-theatre, but logistical problems (as well as simple British negligence and carelessness) kept it from arriving on time and in the correct quantities. Later concentration camps exploited this misfortune.
</li><li> In GULAGs specifically, this was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a> situation. The rations were brutally low to begin with, but increased with your productivity. However, the amount of productivity you needed kept increasing as well, and the rewards could not possibly replace the calories you burned earning it, leaving every prisoner in a vicious cycle. The situation was somewhat alleviated by food packages sent by prisoner's families, and occasionally outright theft (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneDayInTheLifeOfIvanDenisovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneDayInTheLifeOfIvanDenisovich">One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</a></em> shows a good example of both).
</li></ul></li><li> Prisoners in general often had their rations diminished for misbehavior. While not as widely used nowadays because of health concerns, it still happens in places.
<ul><li> A common form of punishment in prisons is "food loaf restriction". The meal the prisoner would be served is mixed up in a blender and baked into a loaf. It has the same nutritional value as a meal, but doesn't taste very good. It can also be served without forks, spoons, or other potentially stabby items. Dessert is a privilege to be earned. Incidentally, guards and prisoners eat the same thing, only guards can go back for seconds if they want.
</li></ul></li><li> This used to be a fairly common punishment for misbehaving military personnel, regardless of country. Nowadays, the most common punishments are forfeiture of pay, extra duty, and restriction of privileges.
<ul><li> Provisions for bread and water rations are still on the books in the U.S. Navy, though there are so many prerequisites to actually inflict such a punishment (health clearance, constant monitoring by medical personnel to ensure such a diet doesn't do lasting harm, constant monitoring to ensure the punished doesn't sneak himself food, etc.) that it is almost never used, as it is far easier to just demote the punished or strip them of pay.
</li></ul></li><li> It used to be that if a Papal Conclave took too long to decide on a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope</a>, Cardinal-Electors would be put on a diet of bread and water until the white smoke blew. This regulation is still technically on the books, but no conclave has dragged on long enough to trigger that provision in a very long time.
<ul><li> This is somewhat surprising, as past elections have dragged on well after food actually was denied. The longest-ever election, November 1268-September 1271 (that's right, it took them <em>almost three whole years</em>) was only ended after the people of Viterbo (where the election was held) decided to remove the roof of the palace where the cardinals were meeting. The Pope elected as a result decided that in the future, papal elections would be held as "conclaves"—i.e. in near-total isolation behind locked doors—and that food would begin to be restricted starting on the fourth day of the conclave.
</li></ul></li><li> Sending a misbehaving child to bed without supper was a popular disciplinary action for many parents. Nowadays, denying a child <em>dessert</em> or a treat is a little more common, though.
<ul><li> This is frequently joked about, with the punchline being that this wasn't much of a punishment because the joke-teller's mother was a terrible cook.
</li><li> Or another family member will take pity on the child and covertly sneak food into their bedroom—the child being already aware that this might happen prevents it from being an especially effective punishment.
</li><li> Or that kids have so much in their rooms nowadays (computer, phone, tv), to punish them you send them to the <em>parents' room</em> (though depending on whether or not the parents' room also has a television, this could backfire as the kid could just switch it on and turn down the volume enough that nobody would hear it).
</li></ul></li><li> Horrifyingly, Rep. Cynthia Davis of Missouri suggested that cutting lunch programmes for children in schools that performed below standards would be a great way to "motivate" kids to do better.
</li><li> The judge in Texas who sentenced a woman to spend the first few days of her animal cruelty prison sentence on a bread and water diet as a reminder of how she'd starved the horses. (after the initial round of news articles, it also showed up on Animal Planet's <em>Animal Cops Houston</em>.)
</li><li> In Applied Behavior Analysis, also known as ABA therapy, autistic children who do not conform to the rules of the session (read: autistic people who stim, or who cannot speak) will be punished by withholding food and drink until they comply, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">in a similar manner to the dog/animal training example below.</a>
</li><li> In North Korea, from what little intel can be gathered from defectors, this is quite pervasive. Those in prison camps are so starved that the inmates must regularly break rules and otherwise steal and hunt for food to survive. However, breaking rules in the camp means you don't even get the normal rations. The general philosophy in the camps is "break enough rules that you get enough food to live, but if you ever get caught you die".
</li><li> Animal charities warn against doing this to train dogs, since it doesn't work and frequently makes them untrainable. Feed them treats for good behaviour instead.
</li><li> Usually averted with slave owners, as if they did not feed their slaves the slaves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">could not work as well</a>; this is discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments">The Ten Commandments</a></em>, in which Moses' slaves are fed and rested for a day, thus making them much more productive.
</li><li> The concept of Hunger Striking inverts this trope. It was popularized by Gandhi, though it existed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">long before his time</a>, and involves someone withholding food from themselves in order to punish someone else. It's typically used by protesters to pressure someone in power, since having someone die from starvation makes whoever they were striking against look pretty bad. When undertaken by prisoners, said prisoners may be punished via force feeding, which can range from mildly unpleasant to outright cruelty, depending on the method used.
