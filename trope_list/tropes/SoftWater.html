</p><p>In the real world, falls into water from even moderate heights can be injurious if not done correctly, as anyone who's belly-flopped or back-smackered off a diving board can attest to. Falls from a sufficient height into water <em>will</em> be fatal <em>regardless</em> of how you manage the impact.
</p><p>But in TV-world, after a moment or two of dramatic silence (and perhaps tears of shock and mourning from onlookers), the hero or heroine will emerge from the lake/ocean/pool none the worse for the wear, except being a bit wet. Which can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySoakedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySoakedShirt">kinda cool</a>.
</p><p>Falls into water from high cliffs are a great way for writers to provide a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath">Disney Villain Death</a> for a character (or a relatively blood-free <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a> in the case of villains) while at the same time leaving open a possible future return because everybody's absolutely certain that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">No One Could Survive That!</a> and they probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverFoundTheBody">never find a body</a>. Of course, this all depends on the falling character not having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope has resulted in a rather interesting side effect. Either believing this trope to be true, or being aware that a majority of the audience believes it to be true, writers know that they can't present a simple long drop into water as a threat, because the audience will assume it's survivable. Usually, in order to show that a potential fall into water would be dangerous, they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">show the water as turbulent with jagged rocks</a>. Because that's somehow more fatal. Even though, you know, violently choppy water is actually safer to fall into, due to lacking surface tension. The rocks'll still hurt, though, because, y'know, rocks.
</p><p>No relation to the stuff that comes out of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">household water softener</a> — which isn't any gentler to land on from a great height than hard water. Also no relation to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaterbed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaterbed">Wacky Waterbed</a> since waterbeds, despite being filled with water, would rupture if one were to fall from a great height and would still lead to injuries.

<ul><li> A commercial by Fleggaard shows nearly-naked female skydivers, one of which fails to open her parachute and lands in a pool from a height of several hundred meters. She climbs out completely unscathed and her biggest problem is that she is now completely naked among several visitors of a nearby party.
</li><li> In a Priceline commercial, William Shatner scales the outside of a hotel and cuts into the window of the room where a guy who "always gets what he wants" is just coming into the room with his daughter.

Now, it looks like this trope will not be in effect, as Haruhi is noticeably unconscious and appears to be drowning. So what does Tamaki do? He jumps in after her, in a diving position, hits the water, grabs Haruhi, and pulls them both out of the water, more or less completely safe.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, Fate's last battle against the title character ended with her unconscious form falling from a great height into the sea without any (additional) injury. Of course, later seasons have shown that a mage's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Barrier Jacket</a> allows them to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">smashed through several floors worth of building and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen">perform hard drops from helicopters</a>, so that ended up looking pretty tame in comparison.
</li><li> The title protagonists from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MichikoToHatchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MichikoToHatchin">Michiko &amp; Hatchin</a></em> fall into the sea from a balloon that is flying at a considerable height. They get wet.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em>, where Train jumps from a skyscraper into a lake below, but first shoots the water to break the water and make it appropriately soft.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>, where Sonic makes an incredibly large leap... only to start falling — and then <em>land in a pool</em>! Subverted in the next moment though, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">this being Sonic</a>, he sinks to the bottom and has to be fished out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>
<ul><li> Near the beginning, Ranma takes his fight with Kunô outdoors — by jumping out the third-floor window. Even though there's a pool below, Kunô is horrified; Ranma panics only because the water will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">trigger his change</a> and possibly reveal it to the school at large. True enough: when they hit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Ranma</a> is perfectly fine and tries to swim away. Kunô, however, is knocked out, and only wakes up while she is dragging him to safety.
</li><li> And near the end, Ranma has to dive over a cliff after his mother, saving her from falling into the raging waters below. Since they all fall into the water a few scenes later, from a <em>much</em> lower height, it's made clear that the danger didn't come from the <em>rocks</em> at the foot of the cliff, but from hitting the water from the top of the cliff.
</li><li> The anime version is somewhat inconsistent: the example with Kunô mentioned above merely stuns him for a few moments, and he grapples with Ranma while still in the pool. Also, in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">movie</a>, after being tossed overboard from Kirin's flying boat, several hundred feet in the air, the whole cast (sans Ranma, Lychee, Happôsai, and the elephant Jasmine) splashes harmlessly into the water below.
</li><li> Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Cursed Doll</a> storyline: a possessed Akane pulls Ranma down with her off a cliff overlooking the water; Ranma immediately pushes her around so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">he</a> hits the water first, shielding her from a direct impact. It's this action that convinces the doll's spirit that she had wrongfully blamed Ranma, and peacefully changes places with the real Akane again.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Angel Blade: Punish!</em> OAV 2, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja">Highly Visible Hottie Ninja</a> Ayame jumps from a diving board on a <em>99-meter-tall</em> tower. Naturally, she dives in the pool unharmed... except that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlipperySwimsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlipperySwimsuit">she loses her two-piece bathing suit</a> in the water, to the great delight of the men around. Why a 99-meter-tall diving tower was built in the first place isn't addressed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MAR">MÄR</a></em>
<ul><li> Ginta is standing on a pillar to confront <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Alviss</a>, landing in the pool created by a waterfall. He has enough momentum that he injures himself on the pool's bottom and complains as he climbs out.

<ul><li> Luffy and a contingent of pirates of mostly Devil Fruit users (who are thus incapable of swimming) free their ship from being stuck at the top of a giant-sized frozen solid tidal wave, by breaking their ship out. What they weren't aware of is that they would fall into an equally frozen <em>warzone</em>. Fortunately, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">happen</a> to land in a hole in the ice made when a giant-sized iceberg was torn out of the sea to be used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">projectile</a>. All this landing on the water from a height of "so high it wasn't even in <em>vision</em>" did not hurt any of them in the slightest, aside from momentary unconsciousness from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a>. Luffy is at least justified — he's virtually immune to blunt impact — and a few of the other characters have similar excuses, but at least half of them should have died.

</li><li> Sadly averted earlier though, the hard landing from the group leaving Skypeia worsened the hull damage Belamy's crew caused to the <em>Going Merry</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this damage made it irreparably trashed, which led to them having to give it a burial at sea when it's no longer fit for sailing</span>.

When he gets near to the balcony, someone enters and pushes him off it. Did we mention that this room was <em>several stores up the building</em>? Conan is just waaaaay too "lucky" that said room was right above the hotel pool, where he lands without much injury. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And it becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> since he deduces that the victim of the week was thrown from the same balcony, but under different circumstances — by the same person who almost killed him.</span>

<ul><li> Scrooge McDuck discovers his trademark ability to swim through cash like it was water when he's thrown off a cliff onto a moving train full of cash below. Naturally, he uses it as Soft Water to save his life. If it's paper-money then this is understandable — but not if it's coins, obviously.
</li><li> In one comic, Scrooge McDuck actually defeats the Beagle Boys this way, right after the Boys have succeeded in legally stealing Scrooge's entire fortune. Scrooge asks them for one last "swim," which the Boys magnanimously grant, though with the suspicion that their victory has left Scrooge so despondent that he plans to break his neck on his lost fortune. On seeing Scrooge dive into a pile of metal coins and surface not only completely unharmed, but swimming and jumping in and out of the money like a dolphin, they decide it looks so fun that they try it themselves... only to knock themselves cold on the hard surface from a much shorter dive. Scrooge's confused nephews ask Scrooge how he manages to swim through money like he does, but Scrooge only reveals that "there's a trick to it." The Boys are left in a coma for months, during which time Scrooge undoes all the legal maneuvering they performed to steal the McDuck fortune.

Even if the falling-distance itself wasn't far enough to be harmful, the velocity of the plane at take-off (175 knots plus) would cause him to be moving faster than terminal velocity, being certainly fatal. Likewise, the lateral motion from the plane would cause him to skip like a stone across the surface of the water, causing a certain fatality. But in the movie, he just falls in as if he had stepped off of a 5-foot platform.

Cheap but forgivable on its own, until one considers the <em>entire movie</em> has been focusing on ways in which a body can be horribly mangled and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">playing them for laughs</a>. Unless the mansion was over 100 feet high, then this is easily do-able; and the skylight would actually <em>slow</em> his fall; glass can't cut you if you hit it sideways. Finally, the water could <em>protect</em> him from the falling glass, as long as he was under it when it hit.

The fall in question is a special case, however, as it's not straight down into a pool of water. Kimble drops into water that is flowing down the outside of the dam, which curves outwards. Provided he could hold his breath for long enough, and the initial contact was at a sufficiently shallow angle, he could have used the dam as a slide. Some may be familiar with the now-vanished funfair/amusement park rides that used the same principle, only with polished plywood rather than water down concrete.

But then again, one is an angel and the other is a semi-legendary monster from the First Age. In both the book and the movie, when Gandalf had been trapped on top of Orthanc, he did not escape by falling 500 feet onto land. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, another Balrog "fell to ruin in the abyss" by slipping from a mountain passage. In this movie, Gandalf and Balrog fell <em>miles</em> to the water, but still were none the worse for wear when they hit bottom. Likewise, in <em>The Hobbit</em> the narrative stated that Gandalf's possible jump from a <em>fir tree</em> "would have been the end of him." Likewise, Tolkien wrote in his editor's notes that "Gandalf needed to survive the fall, so he only fell into a sort of moat located a short fall from the bridge." So it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoftWater">Soft Water</a> that saved Gandalf, not being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>.

</li><li> The Carl Hiaasen novel <em>Skinny Dip</em> opens with the protagonist surviving a several-hundred-foot plunge from the deck of a cruise ship after being pushed off by her husband. It's noted that the only reason she's able to survive the fall is because she was on the diving team in high school and thus knows the proper technique to minimize damage — and even then, the force <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">tears her dress off</a> and leaves her so banged up that she can barely swim.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>: In the early versions of the game, even if you build a tower to the top of the game world and jump into a hole at the bottom of the game world if there is water that is at least four blocks high in the hole — you'll survive. In <em>Minecraft</em> 1.8, the depth requirement was removed; even the minimum possible amount of flowing water will negate all fall damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>: Landing in water negates all falling damage, except it's even more ridiculous when you're using the Water Walking Boots/Potion and stop dead the second you land on the water, unharmed with not even a ripple.
</li><li> Particularly flagrant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> and the mods and sequels thereof, in which a drop from fatal heights could be stopped by landing in any fluid, including but not limited to radioactive waste and spilled coffee, as long as it was <a class="urllink" href="http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dimensions#Falling_Damage">two "units" (roughly 1 to 1½ inches, depending on the game's scale) or deeper<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which case <em>all damage is negated</em> (not counting any damage from the liquid itself, if it happens to be radioactive waste).
<ul><li> Some maps in <em>Half-Life</em> and its mods even incorporate the "fall into a puddle of spilled coffee" game mechanic into their level design. For example, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CounterStrike">Counter-Strike</a></em> map Aztec has a <em>slightly</em> flooded canal flowing below a bridge — players can jump off the bridge and aim for the <em>ankle-deep</em> water to make a strategic shortcut if necessary. Most levels in <em>HL2</em> with significantly high falls into water avoid this trope by placing an instant-death trigger at the water level (most notably in the bridge level).
</li><li> There are at least two instances, one in <em>HL1</em> and one in <em>HL2: Episode Two</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">in order to proceed</a> the player is required to fall an absurd amount of distance into a pool of water.
</li><li> The objective of <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> "surf" maps is to obtain a high velocity through manipulation of flaws in the physics engine. Making 2-inch deep puddles of water is a perfectly logical and simple way for map designers to mitigate all damage to players upon landing.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>. The Master Chief is equipped with a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmour">Powered Armour</a> that allowed a user to survive falling two kilometers, into a forest, with practically no injuries. Falling a few hundred meters into engine coolant isn't hard to believe at all. In most in-game situations, however, falling more than about 10 meters is always fatal, even if there is water below. And some bodies of water are programmed to give MC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">Super Drowning Skills</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield 1942</a></em> and <em>Vietnam</em> treated this realistically, where any fall that would kill if you hit the ground killed if you hit the water, but it reached new heights in absurdity when they took this mechanic out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield 2</a></em> and you could jump out of a jet at 1500 feet and be perfectly fine if you only landed in a body of water.

You can get into a jet, go over a body of water at full screaming-engine speed and drop without a parachute and all you'll get will be wet clothes. Of course, previous games in the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">lacked a swimming mechanic</a>, and so treated any body of water greater than waist-deep as a pool of instant death.

It can be exploited in the "triathlon" minigame introduced in The Ballad of Gay Tony. The triathlon starts with you jumping out of a plane and parachuting to a boat. You can get a nice lead on your opponents by freefalling the whole way to the water, provided you land near (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">and not on</a>) a boat.

<ul><li> In one FMW in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em>, Lara dives off a cliff to evade Natla's henchmen, and of course, survives unscathed. In the add-on to the first game, Unfinished Business, there is a huge drop in the first Atlantis level that involves Lara diving/jumping through a narrow shaft several floors deep before finally landing in a deep pool.
</li><li> In one of the games, Lara is dropped down a shaft into the longest drop in the game — her death-scream, an indicator she will die if she hits the bottom, loops several times — and she is saved by a pool of water, just like in every other jump into water in the games.
</li><li> Similarly, the beginning of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLondonUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLondonUnderground">Aldwych</a> level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em>, where you drop down from the bell tower into the sewers. The death scream doesn't loop here, though.

<ul><li> A notable quest drops you 300 feet in the air over a lake in the Plaguelands. The player lives. It may not be unrealistic for that universe since characters can survive around 65-foot drops onto solid ground as well. On the other hand, the water does need a certain depth to save you. If it's too shallow, you'll smack into the bottom and die.
</li><li> At the monthly Darkmoon Fair event, players can get launched from a cannon and, with a slow-fall buff that must be cancelled at the right time, try to land in a lake half the zone away. The operator advises you to either aim well, or hope you have life insurance.
</li><li> Shamans used to have the power to avert this (and have a good laugh at their friends' expense) by casting the Water Walking spell on the falling person, which would cause them to smack into the water surface as though it was solid ground.
</li><li> In the Wrath of the Lich King expansion, Death Knights have been given a similar skill, allowing them to run on water by freezing a path of ice. To add insult to injury, this spell is cancelled by damage, so that jumping into a lake with it on leads to 1) taking a massive amount of damage, and 2) plunging into the water anyway, probably by smashing your bones through a thick sheet of ice.
</li><li> At least two Northrend dungeons (Utgarde Keep and Azjol-Nerub) have some fun with this. In order to exit Utgarde Keep, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">a giant keep</a>, you have to either A) walk out, or B) jump down into a cavern behind the boss. It's a really big fall... but there is water below you, so it's OK. Azjol-Nerub just has you jumping off a platform, into an even bigger fall, to land in an underwater lake in order to get to the final boss.
</li><li> Done again with the Trial of the Crusader, when Arthas breaks the ground beneath you and drops you to the last boss. You survive by landing in a conveniently-placed pool of water.
</li><li> One of the worst examples is the entrance to the mostly-hidden area "Naz'anak: The Forgotten Depths". It's an insanely long and totally vertical shaft, which takes maybe twenty seconds to fall down and a little more to fly, but as long as you land in the middle of the small pond at the bottom, you will be completely unharmed.
</li><li> One optional boss in Zul'Gurub, Gahz'rahka, tosses players into the air, and they must land in the water to avoid taking falling damage.

Interestingly, if you have a spell of Water Walking enabled, the water will behave just like land...
</li><li> Used and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>; in most cases, water will save you, but landing in the shallows still applies fall damage. One ruin has you falling for a good ten seconds and being saved by 10 feet of water, despite a similar-length fall onto land killing you instantly.
</li><li> Also quite glaringly obvious in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>. Players who want to give this a good looking at, head to the College of Winterhold. There's a fairly decent bit of overhanging rock at the northernmost point. What's it hanging over? A good few seconds of free-falling and a lake. Or the ground, if you're unlucky...

Snake is thrown off of a bridge early in the game, falling to a height in excess of 100 feet, and later leaps from a drainage pipe which is easily even higher of a fall. If Snake leaps or drops off of the bridge on his own, he'll die. Both times Snake lands into water, with no injuries other than what was sustained in a brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">asskicking.</a> The second fall DOES <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">knock him unconscious</a>, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> pulls this off not just with water but also with haystacks (and in the forested areas of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em>, piles of leaves and branches), never mind that these, while not quite as hard as the ground, would be equally deadly due to containing lots of pointy objects. The story justifies this as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">an embellishment of the Animus simulation</a> that the game takes place in, but that doesn't explain why the Assassins themselves are observed to do it as part of their training and Desmond later does it in the modern era.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Taken to extremes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>. To access the last dungeon, you need to shoot yourself into the <em>sky</em> with a cannon. Sure enough, you land in a small pool of water, but at least then you wouldn't be travelling that fast since you slow down when you came up. The real problem is, to get back on earth, you need to use another cannon that <em>shoots you up even higher</em>, with Lake Hylia being the Soft Water.
</li><li> <em>Twilight Princess</em> does it even before that with the introduction to Lake Hylia. Wolf Link and Midna cross a bridge over it when some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> light the oil on the bridge on fire. Wolf Link climbs over the guard rail and jumps off the bridge, managing to fall into the remains of the lake, which is very little water. The distance between the bridge and the lake is "big city skyscraper" height, far enough that no matter <em>how</em> much water there is, hitting it should be little different from hitting concrete.
</li><li> Also done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>, requisite-style. Like the Great Deku Tree, or the waterfalls at the Gerudo Valley and Zora's Domain that are even higher. It's worth noting that Link takes those dives <em>head first</em>. Then again falling doesn't seem to be particularly dangerous in the <em>Zelda</em> Universe, even if impacting solid ground. There's a hidden area in The Fire Temple, which requires the Scarecrow's Song to reach, with a drop that is long enough that Link will stop yelling before he hits the bottom. The result? Landing in a crouch on both feet, grunting, and taking a couple hearts of damage. (In fact, for this franchise, a <em>couple hearts</em> is <em>extreme.</em> Usually, one quarter of a heart, sometimes half, is the penalty for distant falls.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>, as long as the water is deep enough that you can't walk through it you don't lose any hearts no matter how far you fall. You can still drown if you don't have any stamina once you're in the drink, but the impact with the water itself isn't what's fatal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a> 3</em> has a truly absurd example <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even by this Trope's standards</a>. Alph, one of the playable captains in game, gets ejected out of his ship in the Pikmin planet's low orbit, falls all the way to said planet below, but is only slightly dazed from it because he lands in a pool of water. Granted, his fellow captains, Brittany and Charlie, also survive the fall by landing in piles of snow, so it's quite possible that Koppais are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> in general. The fact that they're only a couple of centimeters tall and would have a very low terminal velocity probably helps too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> plays this trope very straight as well; there's one section that <em>requires</em> you to take a huge plummet into water, but you're fine once you do so. The character is a cyborg of sorts, though.

This pool is one of the only things in <em>IWBTG</em> that <em>doesn't</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">instantly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">kill you</a>; in fact, it's like the only thing in the game that <em>saved</em> The Kid?
</li><li> Water in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em> will break your fall perfectly. There is, however, one particularly tall cliff with water below it that the player may be tempted to jump into, as a Colossus is nearby, but it turns out the water is only a few feet deep, and jumping in it is the same as jumping a thousand feet to solid ground that only LOOKS like a nice, deep lake.
</li><li> The classic SNES survival game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SOS">SOS</a></em>.

Although it's only about a 10-20 foot drop, falling in the water causes instant death, no matter what your health. At least until you destroy Pregzt, after which it strangely becomes Soft Water. Definitely not toxic water, either, since going in the water in other parts of the caverns (which connect to this room) doesn't kill you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry">Far Cry</a></em>. The water has to be deep enough to trigger the swimming animation in order not to take any damage. However, if this condition is met, you won't take any damage, whether you've fallen ten feet or a thousand feet. In the <em>Classic</em> remake, this is the easiest way to earn the "Flight Simulation" achievement.

As an added bonus, the water will heal you of ALL damage once you rise back up for air since your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OxygenMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OxygenMeter">Oxygen Meter</a> and HP use the same display. This is taken to the extreme in a bonus stage that takes you into the sky above the castle.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown">Crackdown</a></em>, falling damage can seriously injure your character (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkItOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkItOff">for a while, anyway</a>) unless you aim for a river or the ocean. In fact, the fastest way to end the "High Flier" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">achievement</a> (climbing to the top of the Agency Tower) is to leap off and splash into the tiny pond explicitly placed there to catch you — there's even a second achievement ("Base Jumper") for doing exactly that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries">Mercenaries</a></em> a long fall will <em>almost</em> kill your character (usually dropping you to 2% health) — unless you fall into water, in which case you take no damage.

</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSaboteur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSaboteur">The Saboteur</a></em>.

Not even their hair is damaged. This specific method of travel is common for those traversing the worlds without a ship — in fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kairi</span> first arrived on the world you find her on in this exact fashion.

You could jump from the top and as long as you landed on the wet patch, you were fine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a> Tri</em> treats water in this fashion when transferring from one zone to another; you're never knocked into the air enough to actually go into water. Even if a Rathian knocks you off a cliff, you have time in the zone change to adjust your trajectory so you don't break your back. Also, regardless of the height, you fell from, if you fall into water while carrying a wyvern egg, you always get the "egg sinks to the bottom" animation you get when you lose an egg by entering water, not the "egg shatters" animation you get from falling from a height.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em> as in that game you can fall at any speed from any height and land anywhere and be perfectly fine. However, there is one point where you are dropped down a shaft and fall for several minutes before finally landing in shallow water, completely unharmed. Given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you were dropped down said shaft deliberately by Wheatley</span>, it's entirely possible that it was supposed to kill you. Unexplained, however, is how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">GLaDOS</span> survives the fall alongside you, given <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she is undergoing a stint as a potato</span>. Given a lack of leg braces or boots to mitigate the impact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she should've been a potato pancake</span>. It's even lampshaded before being played straight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">GLaDOS</span> asks to be put in one of Chell's boots during the fall, in order to survive the landing and advises Chell to try to land on the other foot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>, any fall that would normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheFallThatKillsYou">kill you</a> can be survived so long as you fall into a deep enough body of water. You even get an achievement (and some bonus experience points) for taking a dive from 200 meters or higher. Good thing your heroes can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperNotDrowningSkills">swim</a>... It's worth noting that while at first, this appears to be a gameplay convenience, the evidence suggests that this is an actual quirk of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em> world's physics. The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fallen Arm</span>, an island in the game world's ocean, is home to a number of Homs (the game's human-equivalent) who arrived there by falling from Sword Valley, many many miles above, and landing in the ocean nearby. Indeed, you as the player initially arrive there by the exact same route, and if you go back to the specific location you fell from, you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">do it again</a> as many times as you like. Perhaps in all the other instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">falling off the edge of the Bionis</a>, it's not the fall that kills you, but the unfortunate reality of ending up stranded in the middle of the ocean below...

There's only a few bodies of water in the entire game that can be entered from a height, and doing so is completely safe. There are also many, many places where one can jump into the Cloudsea, which is similarly harmless... at high tide. At low tide you presumably get stranded down around the Titan's knees and the game respawns you. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is actually justified for the Cloudsea, though. It's not liquid at all, but a soup of nanobots that happen to have the approximate properties of water when in saturation. The fluffy clouds at the surface mean there's no surface tension to smack into - perfectly safe to cushion a fall, as long as you can swim!</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>: While this is true for the game in general, one particular moment comes to mind. At the end of the Chaos Crystal Cavern jumping puzzle, you enter a magical teleportation gate, and wind up hundreds of feet in the air over a fairly deep lake, with no resulting injuries aside from those inflicted by enemies in the lake.
<ul><li> Also seen often with diving goggles where jumps into often relatively shallow water from several hundred feet cause you no harm at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em>, Max drops about thrice his height into a tiny patch of water that doesn't fully cover him even when lying horizontally. Somehow, it barely affects him.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, where ordinarily lethal fall distances (such as a 100+ foot high overpass) are cushioned by sufficiently deep water (not so much shallow water).

At the beginning of <em>The Lost Age</em>, they wash up on the drifting Idejma Peninsula, and are then, along with Jenna and Kraden (and possibly Alex), hit by a <em>tidal wave</em>. Felix's first action after the latter incident is to check himself for injuries, but everyone's fine if a little shaken (and Alex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">disappeared again</a>).

</li><li> <em>Blockstorm</em> plays this near-completely straight. It's impossible to go underwater in maps that have it, in game-terms only being able to have half of your character's model (the legs) occupy slightly more than a single block of water. This means that falling into water is essentially as instantaneous a stop as falling onto solid ground... but it's only as <em>fatal</em> as such if the water is only one or two blocks deep. If it's three or more, then it completely negates all falling damage.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlasterMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlasterMaster">Blaster Master</a></em> games, Jason will always take fall damage if he falls more than his jump height unless he lands in a body of water thick enough to immerse him completely. There are times that the player can shave a lot of time off their speedruns by landing in the wet stuff instead of taking a ladder back down. This still applies in <em>Zero II</em>, but it is equally bane as it is boon because the G-SOPHIA requires a hard landing to recharge its SP.

<ul><li> On one occasion, a character falls out of a <em>moving aircraft</em> to what should have been certain death. He instead lands unharmed in a rooftop penthouse's swimming pool. If the soft water didn't kill him, the speed he would have hit the water at should have ensured that upon hitting the bottom of the pool, he'd have broken both his legs.
</li><li> Also averted in one episode. The DCAU version of Count Vertigo dies by falling out of a castle window and into the moat.
</li><li> This series uses every trope in the book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyCanDie">to avoid</a> the cartoon violence of a person being killed or injured, despite often falling from high places; they'd just fall harmlessly into a bush, a tree, a canopy, etc. And if anyone did die, it would turn out to be simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">a robotic impersonator.</a>
</li><li> Another scene involves a character being tossed off <em>the Statue of Liberty</em> and landing unharmed in the water below. However, the original writer probably wanted the drop to be fatal but was required to show the victim survive as censorship. Only a few seconds later a similar event occurs when the assassins responsible, as opposed to committing suicide, spray themselves with a mindwiping gas. Instead of dying from the drop, said character was in a coma and never appeared for the rest of the series.
</li><li> Averted when Clayface fell about 30 feet off a cliff and promptly disintegrated when he landed in Gotham River. This is a special case, though, because of his condition.

In the second season finale, Katara attacks Zuko and Azula's men with a huge wave of water that should have been fatal if only because of the sheer weight of the water and not the concussive force. They get all up with no injuries.
</li><li> Interestingly, they avert it in the series finale where after falling from a great height, Aang specifically bends water upwards to catch him and it flows downwards as it returns to sea level meaning he deliberately softened the water to make the landing safe.
</li><li> Also on the episode before that, Sokka lures an entire army of firebenders to the lower deck, flies significantly lower but not too low, where he promptly opens the conveniently placed giant trapdoor, sending them straight off the ocean (somehow including even those who stood on the ramp). They manage to survive, apparently rising unscathed from at least thirty meters above sea level despite many of them wearing heavy armor and to top it all off, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">it is a mook's birthday</a>.

Layla survives because she landed in a river, although she did spend four days in a coma after the ordeal. A few episodes later, while on a mission to rescue the pixies, both Stella and Brandon fall off a cliff and survive by landing in the same river.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em> episode "The New Kid", Static is being pursued by Specs and Trapper's kill-bot, and uses Edwin Alva, who has been funding the pair's research, to get them to stop shooting at him. When Daisy causes a power outage that disables the robot, Static drops Alva into his penthouse swimming pool below. Not only does Alva land headfirst into the water from very high up <em>and</em> emerge unharmed, but the kill-bot had also landed in the pool before him, and was visibly sparking before Static dropped him. And still, he's perfectly fine when he surfaces.
</li><li> Shows up many times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em>, including an instance where a movie studio uses a water tank for a jumping-out-of-a-building stunt that would probably use an air cushion or wires in real life, and an instance that uses the Trope Naming joke when Gadget makes it out of a fall off the roof of his house without so much as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injury</a> because he lands in <em>an inflatable rubber kiddy pool maybe a foot or two deep</em>.

Apparently that, for some reason, is so convincing that even the Spies think he was a goner, until he saves them and it's revealed that he was wearing a waterproof suit, although that still doesn't explain why the focus is on how he survives drowning rather than <em>how he survives the damn fall in the first place</em>.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Disenchantment">Disenchantment</a></em>, where King Zog routinely drops his annoying court jester into the ocean from a trapdoor in his clifftop castle.

<ul><li> It's rather difficult to determine the exact diving height from which lethality is guaranteed, but surviving from around 200 feet (60 meters) isn't unheard of. The current world record is 177 feet (without injury) by Oliver Favre, and suicide attempts from San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge (average 220 feet, varying with rain and such) have rarely been survived.
</li><li> When a train stopped on a bridge at night in Quimperlé, France, two passengers mistakenly thought they'd reached the station and stepped out. The one who landed in the field below died, but the one who landed in the river, a few feet further, survived (although seriously wounded).
</li><li> Cliff diving from places like <a class="urllink" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Quebrada">La Quebrada, Acapulco, Mexico<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> runs on this, though, of course, divers must calculate the right moment to jump to catch an incoming wave and avoid serious injury or death.
</li><li> Many diving wells (the pool that competitive divers land in) have the capability to allow a coach to bubble a considerable amount of air into the pool to ensure a softer landing. These are usually used to train young divers to dive from greater heights (3m platform to 5m or 10m platform, for instance) or to help those just training a new dive (when they're a lot less likely to enter the water cleanly).

Ed. teacher dives in expertly, Yukari SMACKS into the water hard enough to mark her entire front a pinkish-red hue (and with a slap loud enough to make everyone nearby wince). Then she does it <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">again</a></em>, and she knocks herself out.

</li><li> A few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> characters have actually been killed this way, most notably Miharu, Kai's (very) short-lived love interest, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, who's blown off the Gunperry when attempting to launch a missile in defense of the White Base and ends up hitting the water.

</li><li> Interestingly, an issue of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> comic had Lara dropping off a cliff, observing calmly that she will probably break every bone in her body if she hits the water, but that it was "better than kissing the rocks below". She falls into the water with such impact that her glasses shatter, bones are snapped and she falls instantly unconscious, possibly dead — but since the drop was to get into the valley of Shangri-La, a legendary city of eternal health, she wakes up in a king-size bed fully healed.

He kicks the wall and attempts to somersault into a mall fountain, but the cape causes too much drag and he barely makes it. Though he's alive, he's injured his arm and he ends up limping out of the mall, his leg ended up smacking into the edge of the fountain in the end.

The physicist who came up with the idea pitched it to the skeptical airmen had to argue strenuously against the belief that this wouldn't work.
</li><li> Subverted in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RushHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RushHour">Rush Hour</a></em> movie: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> falls from the roof of a convention center into a water fountain making an enormous splash, and the first thing said by Detective Carter is: "Ooh, you <em>know</em> he dead!"

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination5">Final Destination 5</a></em>, as everyone on the crumbling bridge knows better than to try jumping into the comparably-placid water beneath them (even Sam and Peter when the alternative is skewering by construction supplies).

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ButchCassidyAndTheSundanceKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ButchCassidyAndTheSundanceKid">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a></em>. The two outlaws are on the run, having worn out their horses and down to their last few rounds of ammo, trapped at the top of a cliff by their relentless pursuers. Butch proposes that they jump off the cliff into the river below, but Sundance refuses to go, preferring to stay and attempt a doomed shoot-out with the posse. As Butch tries to persuade him, Sundance reveals that he doesn't want to try it because he can't swim, to which his partner replies "Are you crazy? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsymmetricDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsymmetricDilemma">The fall'll probably kill ya</a>!"

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomeoMustDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomeoMustDie">Romeo Must Die</a></em>, where two characters are thrown out of their high-rise, waterfront condo. The next scene is the police fishing their corpses out of the water the next morning.
</li><li> Averted quite a few times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> series: pretty much <em>everybody</em> hitting water from a height dies unless they're diving properly.
<ul><li> Halle Berry still manages to play this trope straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieAnotherDay">Die Another Day</a></em>, though it was given a token <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">Handwave</a> in that her character had apparently chosen the place she dived off beforehand; presumably, she checked the water was deep enough to make the fall survivable. The height she dives from is still pushing a bit, but by the standards of that particular Bond film, it hardly merits a mention.
</li><li> Particularly notable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em>, where a planes <em>explodes</em> on contact with the ocean.
</li><li> Done twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AViewToAKill">A View to a Kill</a></em>, first is when one of the executives gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownFromTheZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrownFromTheZeppelin">Thrown from the Zeppelin</a>, and second is the scene where Max Zorin falls off the Golden Gate Bridge. Though that's the last the audience sees of him (ie. no body), its pretty clear he is killed. Naturally, since many San Franciscans will tell you that simply falling from the street level is fatal (the body is immediately pulverized and the victim — if still alive somehow — drowns in their own blood); Max fell from the <em>very top</em> of one of the towers.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked">The Boat That Rocked</a></em>. The Count and Gavin play a game of Chicken that involves climbing the mast of the ship and then jumping in the water. In the following scene, The Count is seen with a bruised and bandaged face, while Gavin appears relatively unscathed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he stands up, and limps around on a cane</span>.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">Terminator Salvation</a></em>, when Marcus Wright falls from a moving aircraft into a river and goes skipping across the surface like a stone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His not being killed is sort of justified because he's a cyborg.</span>
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeMusketeers1993" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeMusketeers1993">The Three Musketeers (1993)</a></em>. Lady de Winter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath">throws herself off a cliff</a> rather than suffer a beheading. Given the rocks in the water below, the distance, and the obvious reactions of the witnesses, it was a real death.
<ul><li> In contrast to which, the 2011 film has her jumping out of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">airship</a> and turning up alive, apparently only having been knocked unconscious and being in danger of drowning rather than being completely splatted. A particularly laughable example because even films that normally play this trope straight wouldn't have someone surviving a freefall from airplane heights.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing">Van Helsing</a></em>, where Prince Velkan gets tackled off of a cliff by a dying Werewolf and everyone immediately declares him to be dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His later survival is justified as he was bitten by the Werewolf beforehand, so falls that could kill a regular <em>human</em> no longer apply</span>.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em>, The Penguin actually dies after falling into sewer water from above the street. Of course, it probably helps that the water was toxic, but not enough to kill other characters who felt in it from lesser distances and the blood out of his mouth implies internal bleeding.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNote2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNote2017">Death Note (2017)</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Light</span> falls from the Seattle Great Wheel and survives, suffering injuries that put him in a coma for a few days. Whether the fall should be fatal or not, is hard to tell as death-related magic is involved.
</li><li> Averted in <em>Love Is Forever</em> (1983), about a man who brings his wife out of Communist Laos by swimming the Mekong River underwater. At one point the border guards are shooting at them, but the bullets fly all over the place the moment they strike the water, making being hit a matter of pure chance. Not that this makes the river any less dangerous, as all kinds of debris is being swept along in the strong current, and the water is so dirty you might not see an object before it hit you.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BramStokersDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BramStokersDracula">Bram Stoker's Dracula</a></em> where Dracula's wife Elisabeta throws herself into a river from a great height, because she was tricked into thinking he was killed.

Much is made about the problem (no climbing gear, the one and only flier that got him there is now destroyed), and the sheer height of the fall. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then a scientist back on Earth remembers that reduced gravity (okay inertia/centrifugal force) means reduced terminal velocity.

He also uses his shirt as an impromptu parachute</span>.
</li><li> Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomSwift">Tom Swift</a> book <em>Monster Machine</em>, in which Tom and his friends are in a transformable vehicle (now a spacecraft) that is plummeting toward the Pacific Ocean from space. Of course, they survive, but during the descent, Tom muses that even though it's "only" water they are falling toward, from this height, hitting it would be like hitting concrete.

When someone gets thrown off a 10-story(ish) building into a deep swimming pool, they die. Effectively being pulpified in fact. The thrower, apparently finding this amusing, proceeds to get rid of <em>all</em> her opposition in the same way. The main character only survives because she's a vampire, though she's still very badly injured.
</li><li> Subverted in Scott Westerfeld's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRisenEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRisenEmpire">The Risen Empire</a></em> (or <em>Killing of Worlds</em>, depending on if you bought the book as a whole or in halves). While in free fall H_rd brakes her nose on a ridge of ice; the ice then breaks and she continues falling.

When they're about to be hit by a tidal wave, the wizards blithely assure each other that water is soft. Ponder Stibbons remembers the other kids throwing him in the swimming hole, and realizes that no, it isn't.
</li></ul></li><li> Given an early aversion in one of the Doc Savage stories from the pulp magazine of the 1930s. A woman is falling towards the ocean from a height of <em>several hundred</em> feet as Doc and one other person looks on helplessly. The person he's with blurts out that maybe hitting the water won't kill her. Doc has no such illusions, he knows hitting the water after falling that far is the same as hitting concrete.

Averted in a previous episode, when he jumps from a helicopter at around 30-50 feet up, and visibly only assumes a "diving" position about halfway down. It's implied the subsequent five-mile swim to shore was more life-threatening, as he did it fully clothed.
</li><li> Completely averted in an episode of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forever">Forever</a></em>, where a victim was pushed from a bridge into a river, where she met her death.

Hopper has previously mentioned that if someone <em>did</em> fall from that height and hit the water, they'd break every bone in their body; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sure enough, Will's 'body' turns out to be a dummy.</span> Mike is prepared to die from being forced to jump into the lake by the bullies threatening Dustin, if not for Eleven intervening and saving him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em> checked the myth that you could avert this by having something hit the water first in order to break the surface tension. Busted.
<ul><li> "Bullet Proof Water" is confirmed, with the observation that high-caliber rifle rounds are easily stopped (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerStick">more so for the .50 BMG</a>), but smaller projectiles such as pistol rounds and 12-gauge shot can cut through to at least eight feet (ignoring problems of deflection). They also observe that the relative angle between shooter and target suggests that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesMathematics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesMathematics">a mere foot or two of depth</a> can provide the needed protection.
</li><li> At least part of this is due to a bullet's center of gravity (especially long skinny pointy rifle bullets with a copper jacket and dense core) being located towards the rear. They exit the barrel flying in a tight spiral but tend to yaw or tumble when entering a denser medium (such as water, ballistic gel, or organic tissue). The increased surface area effectively turns an aerodynamic "dive" into a "belly flop"; the added resistance can cause the bullet to break apart given enough velocity. The same rifle bullets at a longer range (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a> tested at very short range) would shed velocity and thus probably go deeper underwater without disintegrating. Some discussion on this yawing effect with 5.56mm NATO-standard ammunition <a class="urllink" href="http://ammo.ar15.com/ammo/project/AmmoOracleFiles_ORIG/index.html#m193orm855">can be found here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In "Dive to Survive", they confirm the myth that you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutrunTheFireball">survive an explosion</a> by diving into shallow water. Although, they point out that water can only protect you from an explosion if the conditions are just right. You can be protected from say, gasoline, but water will not save you from more powerful high explosives. You would at the very least have to be submerged at least 50 feet away, and that's for the relatively weak dynamite.
</li><li> Royal Navy pilot Charles Lamb once had to ditch a stricken aircraft at sea, unable to make it back to his carrier. Fortunately, the ship knew he was in trouble and had launched a rescue boat. Unfortunately, Lamb realized his aircraft had been carrying a full load of primed depth charges and was sinking fast. He knew once the aircraft sank to about a hundred fathoms, the depth-sensitive fuses would go off. He also knew the explosion, powerful enough to cripple a U-boat, would send out shockwaves that would pulverize the flimsy boat he was currently in and mash those aboard it to pulp. He then took over the rowing of the boat over the head of an affronted bosun, not revealing the peril they were in for fear of causing panic, but wanting to get back to the safety of the nearest big ship (not necessarily his own carrier), double-quick.
</li><li> In "Dodge a Bullet" Kari Tory and Grant "bust" the myth that landing in water is the same as landing on concrete at terminal velocity; seemingly upholding this trope. However, they took the myth literally and said that the G-forces and injuries to a pig carcass weren't <strong>identical</strong>, rather than following the spirit of the myth that no matter which you hit, dead is dead.
</li><li> In "Cannonball Chemistry" Adam and Jamie test if floating a mattress on water will invoke this trope and make it safe to land on from a long fall (35 feet according to the myth taken from an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>). They find that it actually makes matters worse, but then bring on a professional stunt coordinator (the same one who helped them with Dumpster Diving) who showed them that if you know what you're doing water can be soft — by jumping from 35 feet and safely decelerating in just over 4.5 feet of water (the depth of the shallow end of a pool described in the mattress jump myth).

<ul><li> Averted in 3.5 rules: for the first 20 feet you take no damage and for the next 20 you take reduced non-lethal damage, but beyond that, you take falling damage as normal. Somewhat straight if you dive into the water, as if the water is deep enough you can make a Swim check and negate the damage no matter how high up you are. However, the DCs to make this dive grow pretty fast.
</li><li> 1st Edition rules (from the <em>Dungeonneer's Survival Guide</em>) also took a water landing into account. On a successful Dexterity check, a character can dive and divide the damage by 10 as a result. On a failed check, though, the fall is just as damaging as against hard stone.

At one point, it's mentioned that some people prefer living above a body of water, because if they fall off their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent">floating island</a>, they'll land safely in the water. It's then mentioned that falling into water from that height is like falling onto concrete. There is no way to see for yourself, as the instant death grid at the bottom of every stage is always above the water.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfJuarez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfJuarez">Call of Juarez</a></em> is a rare exception to this rule, where falling into water exerts the same damage as falling onto solid ground.
</li><li> Notably averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> series starting with <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMirror">Dark Mirror</a></em>, where falling into the water from a sufficient height is <em>definitely</em> harmful. Judging the fatal height (for both water and solid landings) is also quite difficult thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em>'s health system, where characters are given a (literal) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofVest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofVest">Bulletproof Vest</a>, but very little health. The earlier installments also sort of averted the trope, by virtue of <em>not having any real bodies of water to speak of</em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter2">Syphon Filter 2</a></em>, for example, a fatal fall from a bridge or a sheer cliff in an environment where a river at the bottom may be assumed to be present, are actually just well-disguised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pits</a>. If you fall in, the water is not shown — the screen just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToBlack">fades to black</a>, the "Mission Failed" message is shown, and you're brought back to your last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Checkpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Checkpoint">checkpoint</a>.
<ul><li> In <em>Omega Strain</em>, falling a height that would be fatal on land (only a few meters) also kills you if you land in water.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlueDragon">Blue Dragon</a></em> features a subversion by way of unexpectedly avoiding the issue entirely. Early on, the main characters are dropped out of a flying fortress over a large body of water, and — as we know they're not going to die yet — it seems like there'll be a Soft Water save. Instead, they're sucked back up into a different part of the fortress, and we never find out if they'd have survived the fall; although, if their reactions to the situation are any indication, they wouldn't have.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em> spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExTheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExTheFall">Deus Ex: The Fall</a></em> this trope is averted. The main character jumps out of a plane over the ocean, surviving thanks to futuristic technology that uses force fields to cushion falls, but even with said technology he still takes extreme damage from the fall and has to be hospitalized from it.
</li><li> Averted at one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedDrakesFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnchartedDrakesFortune">Uncharted: Drake's Fortune</a></em>. Early in the game, you need to raise the water level in a pit to make it down safely, because it's still too far to fall without dying. It's played straight at other points and in the sequel though.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 2</em>, as if you slip whilst navigating the outside of the Big Shell you get treated to a short of Raiden screaming as he plummets to his demise before switching to the mission failed screen.
</li><li> For a game that uses so many of the idioms you'd see in a typical action movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause">Just Cause 2</a></em> almost averts this. Rico can fall very far onto solid ground without getting hurt, and can even prevent fall damage by using his grappling hook to <em>pull himself straight towards the ground</em>, but if a fall is high enough for him to take damage (indicated by him going into a skydiving position), belly-flopping in water will not negate it. However, diving headfirst in to the water will allow you to take no damage at all.
</li><li> The game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> begins with a paratrooper drop, but when the player's parachute is torn off by a flying alien, it is heavily implied that you only survived the drop into the ocean because of your nanomuscle suit (which was briefly disabled by the impact). However, the in-game physics engine plays the trope pretty straight.
</li><li> Subverted-ish in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em>. Drop a short distance into water? You'll probably be fine. Drop a long way? You'll black out for a moment, and if the water isn't deep enough you <em>will</em> take damage. A couple of times you do dive what seems to be about fifty to a hundred feet into a cenote, but the water's deep. Justified in that your character is into extreme sports and knows how to dive properly (feet first, arms crossed). You can trigger an animation showing the protagonist crossing his arms together when diving by making sure that you are sprinting and looking downwards before diving into a (fairly deep) body of water.
</li><li> Averted with the Windham Classics text adventure of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TreasureIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TreasureIsland">Treasure Island</a></em>. Fall overboard during the storm or from any great height and instant death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AValleyWithoutWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AValleyWithoutWind">A Valley Without Wind</a></em> calculates falling damage upon impact with the surface of water, and only then does it slow you down. The fact the acid water also starts eating at your health is just salt in the wound at that point.

One potential "Good News / Bad News" segment begins with the assurance that it's "just water"...then explains that falling into any body of water above fifty feet provides the same effect as falling onto cement.
</li><li> Averted in some parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeGal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeGal">Time Gal</a></em>. Some of the failure outcomes shows the protagonist falling from a great height into water, high enough for it to be fatal.

Hitting the ground too hard will cause parts to explode, but doing so slows down the rest of the ship, which could allow the at least part of it to survive. Hitting water doesn't slow down the ship nearly as much, resulting in it completely self destructing as each part enters the water. Averted as of the 1.0 update, which introduced more realistic water physics.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>: being pushed off the top of a waterfall or catapulted into a pond causes realistic concussion, broken bones, organ damage and eventually death from trauma or internal bleeding.Even short falls (about 3 feet) can prove fatal, as they will still stun the victim long enough for them to drown.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>. Falling from high enough will kill the character who hits the water.

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FlushedAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FlushedAway">Flushed Away</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><em>(Spike and Whitey are falling)</em> <br/><strong>Spike:</strong> Keep your legs straight when you hit the water! <br/><em>(Whitey lands safely in the water, while Spike hits a cement stone)</em>
</div></li><li> In the opening sequence to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfZelda">Legend of Zelda</a></em> cartoon, Link fires some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">blasts from his sword</a> to break up the surface of the pond/moat into which he and Zelda are falling.
</li><li> Technically averted ("technically" because it still falls under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaIsBoilingKoolAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaIsBoilingKoolAid">another artistic license trope</a>) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "Dragon Quest". Spike jumps off of a high cliff into a pool of lava some teenage dragons are bathing in to try and impress them. He hits the surface with a loud smacking noise, then slowly sinks.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats">SWAT Kats</a></em> episode "Mutation City" where Jake/Razor is knocked unconscious when he hits the water and has to be saved by his partner.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder33');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder33" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There was a skydiver whose parachute failed to deploy, and she fell into water, and survived. There was a catch, though; it wasn't exactly clean water. She fell into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">open sewage receptacle</a>. Non-aqueous fluids can also be considerably lighter than water, with oil being a prime example.
</li><li> Cliff divers, whose dives are usually about twice as high as platform divers, usually enter the water feet first: better to have a broken leg than a broken neck. Those that have to dive "head-first" actually dive <em>arms</em>-first: using locked arms and carefully-positioned hands to break the water ahead of the head.
</li><li> As noted, San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge is the site of frequent suicide attempts, a few of which each year are unsuccessful. It's to the point that there are crisis hotline phones along the bridge sidewalks as well as signs warning suicidal people against making the jump, as detailed in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicides_at_the_Golden_Gate_Bridge">this Wikipedia article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In 2011, a teenage boy leaped from the bridge during a field trip (apparently convinced by this trope that he was in no real danger) and not only lived but sustained no injury more serious than bruising. There are a lot of variables that come into account in these falls, but it's usually the wind that saves you.
</li><li> It wasn't the explosion of the Space Shuttle <em>Challenger</em>'s fuel tank that killed the crew — that only threw the shuttle off-kilter, and the resulting supersonic aerodynamic stresses tore the orbiter apart. It wasn't the disintegration of the orbiter that killed the crew, either — the crew module survived the midair breakup intact. What <em>did</em> kill them was falling a hundred thousand feet and landing in the ocean at 200 miles per hour.
</li><li> While 30 feet is hardly significant in fiction, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.history.com/shows/stan-lees-superhumans/videos/super-high-diver#super-high-diver">free falling 30 feet into 12 inches of water and walking away without any noteworthy injuries does deserve mention<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Well, there is what's known as the "thirty-thirty" — thirty feet over the water, thirty knots, lobbing frogmen out the back. Granted they aren't landing in a foot of water, but...
</li><li> 30 feet, or ten meters, is also a fairly standard height for the highest amongst diving boards. It's a height at which even bad dive attempts are usually survived without too serious injuries. Which is why a foot of water can break one's fall: the diver goes on purpose for a very painful but ultimately survivable belly flop. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a>, though, not without some serious stunts and/or diving experience. Double that height and even professional cliff divers won't jump without a safety team standing by. At these heights, air friction doesn't play much of a role yet, and a little extra height can make a big difference.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2015, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/17/boston-jumping-out-windows-into-snowbanks-mayor-speech_n_6699228.html">Bostonians, pelted by snow, have been jumping off second story windows into snow banks. For kicks.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The jumpers are taking advantage of the very "airy" nature of fresh-fallen snow: the same nature that causes you to sink into that snow unless you spread your weight with things like snowshoes. All that air provides a means of softening the impact. As of the writing of the article, there are apparently no reports about getting hurt but the Mayor of Boston is telling people to stop (because the snow may be concealing something less forgiving underneath).
</li><li> When the Red Army ran out of parachutes in the winter of 1941, its paratroopers were instructed to make desperation jumps <em>anyway</em>, leaping from planes at below two hundred feet and instructed to aim at snowdrifts. Incredibly, some paratroopers survived.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1z91c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1z91c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1z91c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Heavily laden paratroops leaping out of planes without parachutes. What do <em>you</em> think happened to the majority, even allowing for fresh-laid snow underneath? Do also remember that this was <em>not</em> standard operating procedure and was only carried out due to an <em>extremely</em> desperate military situation.</span> Some even survived long enough to join up with partisan groups behind German lines and carry on fighting.
