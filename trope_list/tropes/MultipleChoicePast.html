Roger was born after the Event in Paradigm, but thanks to his burst of Memory, is revealed to be a cop (or a major in the army) from before the Event who quit once the first Megadeus was discovered underground and became Big O's pilot at some point, but then, after a final burst of memory, it's revealed that he might actually a robot mass produced to pilot Big O units. It's made even more confusing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when you realize that none of the memories from before the Event actually existed, and Paradigm City was a virtual reality, one which looks suspiciously like New York City.</span> Good luck trying to sort out <em>that</em> mess...
</li><li> Hiruma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> is seen pulling this during a flashback chapter.

Nunnally hints in one manga that they're all multiple timelines or realities by explaining how she saw the events of the original series happen in one of them.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamRocket">Team Rocket</a>-themed episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Chronicles</em> implied that Jessie and James didn't know each other before joining Team Rocket, but an early episode implied they knew each other fairly long before that. Hell, Team Rocket is <em>full</em> of these. Did Jessie go to nursing school or did she join a bike gang (though admittedly she could have gone to school after leaving the gang)? Did Jessie and James meet in the bike gang, at an academy they flunked out of, or when they joined Team Rocket? Was Meowth Giovanni's right-hand 'mon until Persian came around, or was he a servant?
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a> Next</em> has a chef who gives 4 different versions of his origin, one for each of the main characters.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> franchise operates on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a> basis, so characters have whatever backstory the writers feel like giving them. However, the writers do agree on some general principles, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> sort of storytelling convention that explains the crew's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a> as acknowledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>, Maria's death changes every time. In episode 36 Maria is shot while running in the halls and survives to give Shadow a speech but episode 38 shows Maria lying on the floor already shot and <em>then</em> delivering the speech. Episode 37 has a completely different flashback, from the POV of Maria's killer, that shows Maria was shot right as she sent Shadow down to Earth (and with no dramatic speech either). The room also differs in each flashback. This is all chalked down to Shadow's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">memory being tampered with</a> and his memory just being unclear after 50 years in stasis.

</li><li> The prominent DC villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Brainiac">Brainiac</a> has not been able to keep his backstory consistent for more than a few years, not even getting into various adaptations.
<ul><li> From 1958 to 1964, he was an alien scientist from the planet Bryak, who wanted to shrink and bottle cities so he could create his own empire to rule. From 1964 to 1986 he was retconned as an alien android from the planet Yod (or Colu, depending on the story), out to dominate or destroy (depending on the story) the universe. He was absent for a couple years until 1988 declared that, in the new continuity, he was an (organic) alien scientist from the planet Colu, who via an accident transferred his mind onto a swarm of nanites that then possessed various bodies both mechanical and organic. He went insane and went on killing sprees on Earth (though his motivation and scope was variable, going from an Earth-restricted serial killer who just wanted to hassle Superman to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiversalConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiversalConqueror">Multiversal Conqueror</a>). He was totally organic from 1988 to 1998 (possessing first human psychic Milton Fine, then a newly-created body resembling his Coluan one complete with green skin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence">Super Intelligence</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, then finally stealing Doomsday's body), totally mechanical bar the origin of his mind from 1998 to 2008 (in his Brainiac 2.5, Brainiac 13, and nanoswarm forms), and took a couple breaks in both these periods to possess or build a cyborg form (such as Brainiac 6, who was a version of him from the future... long story).
</li><li> The 2008 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBrainiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBrainiac">Superman: Brainiac</a> story decisively retconned <em>all</em> previous versions of him as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">robotic or cloned probes</a> sent by the real Brainiac, who was definitively established as an originally organic, now cybernetic alien scientist from the planet Yod-Colu who was born the most intelligent member of a super-intelligent race, and used his inventions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">various</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence">powers</a> to go rogue and become a planet-destroying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters">civilization-stealing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror">Galactic Conqueror</a>.

This was then interrupted in 2011 by the New 52 continuity rebooting his backstory <em>again</em>: it kept him as an organic turned cyborg scientist from Colu, but changed his motivation and made him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> instead of the cold greedy monster he always was, while also giving him a wife and kid in his backstory which no previous version had. (The previous continuity's version of Vril Dox II was a clone, and not one Brainiac felt affection for.) After the New 52 was soft-rebooted with 2016's Rebirth, he's back to more-or-less the 2008 version. Time will tell how long this sticks.
</li></ul></li><li> King Mob from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvisibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvisibles">The Invisibles</a></em> has a self-constructed multiple choice past, whose point is to stop enemies with telepathic powers from prying information about him and his group. If they try, they can't be sure which memories are true and which are part of a fake past.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, was especially susceptible to this; his amnesia about his past was a common plot driver in early-90s stories, and what we knew kept getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a>. Even after it was made so that he could remember every single thing that ever happened to him, the series <em>Wolverine: Origins</em> still managed to milk the concept - remembering <strong>everything</strong> meant that his real memories were no stronger or more distinct than his fake memories.
</li><li> Wolverine's arch-enemy Victor Creed, a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a>, likewise has multiple possible pasts. He was part of the same Weapon X program as Wolverine, which included false memory implants, so that's no surprise. A notable example is his mother: she was initially thought to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed her own life</a> to protect Victor from his abusive father, only for a later one-shot to show a young Victor killing her himself for failing to stop the abuse. Then, years later, it turned out she was still alive and in a nursing home, and that Victor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">actually had a very close and loving relationship with her</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">The Phoenix</a> is either Jean Grey's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> or a variation on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">Grand Theft Me</a> who duplicated her rather than possessing her.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">90's animated series</a> used both (minus the duplicating).
</li></ul></li><li> The DCU's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossovers</a> (and not just the ones actually bearing the Crisis name) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">altered reality</a>, changing the pasts and presents of a variety of characters. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> has had <em>four</em> such reality reboots (counting the original Crisis.) Also, retellings of characters' origins will vastly alter them on occasion, with no Crisis-type justification. As such, most DC characters with a significant amount of history have multiple formerly-canonical histories, as well as ones that are <em>equally</em> canonical but completely incompatible.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, for example, has a <em>canonical</em> multiple-choice past: one time, he was given the choice between two of his innumerable origin stories, and he picked the one that he liked more (and, incidentally, made more sense), while another time someone travelled through his many origins while observing him.
</li><li> One side-effect of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcons</a> has been that since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em> the DCU <em>itself</em> now has multiple pasts which all happened.
</li></ul></li><li> An inconsistent past is almost canon for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>, as evidenced by his quote at the top of the page. A number of writers have given him a different origin in the past fifty or sixty years, and all of them are half-canon, because The Joker <a class="urllink" href="http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/109071/3574772-2316207526-dcori.jpg">isn't sure himself.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> One constant factor is that he usually wore the Red Hood before he was dumped into that vat of chemicals.
<ul><li> While being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em> has ironically little of this, since it shows flashbacks of a single, consistent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> for the Joker. The trope is only suggested by the line about how he remembers multiple versions and prefers a multiple-choice past, but it's a highly plausible reading that what was shown is the real story and he just doesn't remember it. Both the story's artist <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBollard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianBollard">Brian Bollard</a> and writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> have said afterwards that giving the Joker a fixed origin story wasn't such a great idea.
</li><li> Also played with in one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a></em>, which starts off with a flashback about a green-haired, white-skinned boy in a purple shirt with a pony. "Or was it a bike?" the narration muses. "No, a pony." The little boy did something bad, and then his daddy shot the pony in front of him. Cut to the Joker, narrating, and he's actually weeping real tears. He's in a cell at Arkham, and a speaker on the wall asks him if the story is true, because it's the <em>seventh</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> story he's told them.
</li><li> Another variation on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> theme shows up in the comic <em>Mad Love</em> (later adapted into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheNewBatmanAdventuresE21MadLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheNewBatmanAdventuresE21MadLove">an episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">The New Batman Adventures</a></em>):
<div class="indent"><strong>Harley Quinn:</strong> Joker told me things, secret things he never told anyone... <br/><strong>Batman:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">What did he tell you, Harley? Was it the line about the abusive father, or the one about the alcoholic mom?</a> Of course, the runaway orphan story is particularly moving, too. He's gained a lot of sympathy with that one. What was it he told that one parole officer? Oh, yes... 'There was only one time I ever saw dad really happy. He took me to the ice show when I was seven...' <br/><strong>Harley:</strong> <em>(crying)</em> Circus... He told me it was the circus. <br/><strong>Batman:</strong> He's got a million of them, Harley.
</div></li><li> A 2004 story arc in <em>Batman: Gotham Knights</em> suggested that the <em>Killing Joke</em> version is more or less Joker's real past, since a pre-Riddler Edward Nigma witnessed the murder of "Jack"'s wife and later offered to tell the Joker who did it (although the version told in <em>The Killing Joke</em> has it that his wife was killed in an accident, not murdered). Later writers have pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">ignored it</a>.
</li><li> In Shadow of the Bat #38, <em>Tears of a Clown</em>, the Joker celebrates his anniversary of the day he was a still sane, but hapless comedian, and was thrown out of an exclusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandUpComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandUpComedy">Stand-Up Comedy</a> club for an unfunny act. Being desperately poor, this marks his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> as he agreed to provide to his family by pulling a job for the Red Hood gang. He kidnaps all the patrons that didnt laugh with him and reenacts his act with control collars that will kill them when they laugh. The funny thing is that the patrons are hardcore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandUpComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandUpComedy">Stand-Up Comedy</a> fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">so they have seen so many acts that nobody remembers the act of a bad comedian</a>. The Joker cannot even be sure that this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> really happened.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> They throw me out, and I had a wife and an unborn child or it was two cows and a goat? Sometimes it's so confusing...
</div><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanEndgame">Batman: Endgame</a></em>, the Joker is strongly implied to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> of some sort, who may very well have existed in Gotham in some way since before the city was even built. At the very least he appears to be semi-immortal, which rather well-explains how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">he always manages to come back despite the horrible damage his body's been put through over the years</a>. And then at the very end, when Batman is claiming to believe in the Joker's immortality, the Joker is clearly worried that he's about to die.</span> A backup story has the Joker tell different, completely contradictory origins to a doctor and a group of Arkham patients, tricking the former into writing a book by posing as a colleague. That same story has him change his stance on his past (described in the quote at the top of the page), showing that something's changed and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">Joker is far more serious than he ever was before</a>.
<div class="indent"> <strong>The Joker:</strong> ... And then that night, over the wine and the candles, and that oh so beautiful music, you showed me your manuscript. I was so sad to see all the blanks you couldn't fill. I couldn't help but lend a hand. I might have been in hiding... but I can't help myself. I just like to make people smile. Hehehehe... <br/><strong>Maureen:</strong> All the work we did... <br/><strong>The Joker:</strong> Oh, it's a good story, isn't it? Not quite as good the one where I'm a secret robot. Beep boop beep. But a good one, nonetheless. I did my best to help come up with the story you wanted. The one you needed. The grim and grimy tale of woe. The one a publisher would lay down six figures for. And heck, all I had to do is pay off a few foster parents. Write a few government documents. It made you soooo happy. <br/><strong>Maureen:</strong> ... Why? <br/><strong>The Joker:</strong> The same reason I visited all of them. You wanted to know who I was. You wanted the truth. The deep down real truth. And here I am... giving it to you. <br/><strong>Maureen:</strong> <em>(handed a revolver)</em> What's this? <br/><strong>The Joker:</strong> Five bullets in the cylinder. Since we're pals, I'm giving you the chance to decide. Which story do you think is the real one? That's the one who gets to live. That's what I said from the beginning. <br/><strong>Maureen:</strong> But... none of them are real, are they? <br/><strong>The Joker:</strong> Hmmm... then here's a sixth. Just in case. Heh... <br/><strong>Maureen:</strong> Where did you go? <br/><strong>The Joker:</strong> Where I always go. To that little corner in the back of your head where all the bad things hide. That's where I'm really from. That's the real truth of it. Hah. Or not. I prefer not to think of it as multiple choice... it's more choose-your-own-adventure.
</div></li><li> The New 52 Joker is probably Red Hood One from <em>Zero Year</em> ... but might also be Alby Stryker from the retelling of "The Case of the Chemical Syndicate" in <em>Detective</em> vol 2 #27, <em>both</em> of whom fell in vats of acid during a confrontation with Batman at Ace Chemicals.
</li><li> And then they outdid themselves when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em> revealed that the answer to the multiple-choice is: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>all of the above</em>.

Thus, every time Batman dies, rather than heading to any sort of afterlife, he's reincarnated as another Bruce Wayne in another universe, to relive Batman's origin story and become a slightly different Batman.</span>
<ul><li> In another of the stories a psychologist is sent to interview <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy">Poison Ivy</a>, and tries to sort out the different origin stories in the files and newspaper reports on her. Ivy bursts out laughing and says that sometimes she just makes stuff up for a joke, and she's surprised people took her seriously.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 80s, an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">The Question</a></em> reinvented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheRiddler">The Riddler</a>; his real name was Edward Nashton, and he changed it to Edward Nygma when he became the Riddler. His obsession with riddles wasn't born from cheating in a school competition and wanting to prove how clever he was; it was a compulsion to tell the truth due to a violent father. It also claimed that he was never a major Batman villain. Later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> wrote a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretOrigins">Secret Origins</a></em> story in which Riddler retells his classic origin, before adding "Or maybe I'm a frustrated second-rater called Nashton with a meaningless schtick!"
<ul><li> The Riddler's latest origin, post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>, is <em>largely</em> his classic origin... but his real name is Edward Nashton. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">It has since been reverted back to Nigma.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Black Manta, oh Neptune, Black Manta. If DC had no idea what to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a> for most of his history, you better believe they didn't know what to do with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>. Pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a>, he had at least three wildly different and convoluted backstories and motivations for his feud with Aquaman, not counting the brief period he claimed to be a militant Black nationalist. You really have to wonder why it took them until 2011 to come up with Aquaman killed his dad".
<ul><li> Originally he was kidnapped and enslaved on board a ship, saw a young Aquaman in the distance and called out to him for help, but Arthur didn't hear him and swam away.
</li><li> The 2003 series claimed that he was a severely autistic child who grew up in an asylum and was obsessed with water, and broke out after being subjected to experimental electroshock therapy.
</li><li> Post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrightestDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrightestDay">Brightest Day</a></em>, he was a treasure hunter who was exploring the Bermuda Triangle with his pregnant wife, and they were abducted and tortured by Xebelians. His wife died and his unborn child was experimented on and grew up to be Aqualad, and he really hated Mera, not Aquaman.
</li></ul></li><li> Tom King's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batman">Batman</a></em> run has an intentional invocation of this technique, where Batman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a> argue about when and where they first met. Batman claims it was when he caught a disguised Catwoman during a diamond heist (which is how they met in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">The Golden Age</a>), and Catwoman claims it was when Bruce Wayne was stabbed by a young Holly Robinson back during Selina's time as a prostitute (which is how they met in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanYearOne">Year One</a></em>). It's eventually revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that they actually both remember both events; it's just that Selina thinks their encounter on the street was purely them, before the costumes and codenames, while Bruce thinks they didn't <em>really</em> meet each other until they did so as the Bat and the Cat.</span>
</li><li> The Scarecrow's first origin story begins with him frightening birds as a child. Skip forward a few decades to the Year One version, and in a 180 turn he's frightened <em>by</em> birds — namely, by a trained attack squad of crows in the old chapel his great-grandmother likes to lock him in. Also, origin stories differ as to whether he was a child bully (i.e. his first episode in the animated series, which had a flashback of him chasing girls with handfuls of snakes) or a bullied child.
<ul><li> The New 52 only makes things more complicated since in that aforementioned Year One story his mother was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">a teen mom</a> that was taken away from her at birth and his dad was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorifiedSpermDonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorifiedSpermDonor">Glorified Sperm Donor</a>. Here his mom is given a (frankly unceremonious) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">Death by Origin Story</a> and his father was made into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">that was exactly like him</a>. This was carried over into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em> and is supposedly still canon to Rebirth going by the official DC website.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> also has a large number of competing origins for his past. There's also some disagreement as to whether Wade Wilson is his real name or a name he stole from someone else. Pretty much the only thing all the origin stories have in common is that his regeneration abilities are a result of time spent as a Weapon X test subject. Like the Joker, Deadpool is insane enough that he probably has no idea himself which one is correct. He does seem fairly certain that Wade Wilson is his real name, however.
<ul><li> Somewhat ambiguous whether or not he really has an actual Multiple Choice Past or not. The only person that ever brought up the possibility does so during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>.
</li><li> T-Ray even hints that 'Pool may <em>not</em> be Wade Wilson at all - instead, T-Ray himself would be Wade Wilson, and Deadpool stole the name from him. The comics seem to keep disproving this story, but given how nuts DP is and in light of what's been exposed in this bullet point, the jury's still out.
</li><li> <em>Cable and Deadpool</em> stated that Wade's father was an abusive military officer who was shot and killed by one of Wade's friends, while a later run seemed to imply that has father had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">walked out on him as a child</a>, and started a new family elsewhere.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MarvelNOW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MarvelNOW">Marvel NOW!</a></em> run eventually clarifies Deadpool's origin, as well as the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHoles">Plot Holes</a> and retcons. It turns out the stuff with T-Ray being the <em>real</em> Wade, as well as all the conflicting stuff about his family, were the result of a scientist named Butler putting Deadpool in advanced hallucinations while he harvested his DNA over the years.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupremePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupremePower">Supreme Power</a></em>, Zarda gives three conflicting origin stories that involve both her and Hyperion when he asks her where she came from. Since Zarda's demonstrably insane, it's safe to say none of them are even close to true.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> comics (and later, the movies and the '00s cartoon), Splinter was originally the beloved pet rat of Hamato Yoshi, who saw his master's assassination and then later was mutated into a humanoid intelligent rat-being. In the '80s cartoon series and the spinoff comic books, Splinter is Hamato Yoshi himself, forced into exile and living in the sewer when he first encountered the mutagen. Having recently been in contact with sewer rats, the mutagen turned him into a humanoid rat. In his profile on the DVD of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1990">first live-action movie</a>, it's said that Splinter's origins are "shrouded in mystery" and that either one of them is possible.
</li><li> One issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretOrigins">Secret Origins</a></em> gave four different, mutually-exclusive origins for the mysterious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePhantomStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePhantomStranger">Phantom Stranger</a>. According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, they're <em>all</em> true.
<ul><li> When a Black Lantern tried to eat the Phantom Stranger's heart during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a></em>, it saw three of those backstories, leaving it stunned long enough for the Stranger to spring a trap. The Stranger's response? "You have seen everything and you have seen nothing."
</li><li> And then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">reboot happened</a> and he actually does have a concrete origin now, where he's heavily implied to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Judas Iscariot.</a> </span>

</div><ul><li> Additionally, all of these stories were parodies of Marvel characters' origins.
</li></ul></li><li> Bizarro, although in this case it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> because, technically, Superman has been cloned more than once, and not always perfectly, and more than one of those imperfect clones have been named Bizarro.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a> has a particularly interesting multiple choice past. Originally, she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>'s equivalent from Earth-2. After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> all the alternate Earths out of existence, Power Girl was kept around, but now lacked an origin or even a defined species, as Superman was now the only Kryptonian around. Over the years, different writers tried different takes, giving her a magical Atlantean past, an alien Daxamite heritage, and so on. With the return of the multiverse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em>, Power Girl's history has now become her origin: she was from Earth-2, but after it ceased to exist the universe spent years trying to make her fit, but her true Kryptonian heritage has now been re-established. (This doesn't apply to the New 52's first Power Girl, who's simply Supergirl's analogue from the new multiverse's Earth-2.)
<ul><li> Post Crisis Supergirl also had this in spades... when she first appeared her backstory was simple, She was sent to Earth at the same time as Superman and was his older cousin and she was supposed to look after him when they got there, but she was trapped in Kryptonite and in suspended animation for years and didn't emerge until Superman was a full grown adult. But then it was revealed that, that origin might be partly false and that her whole side of the El family was evil and she was sent to kill her cousin. But then it was revealed that, while she <em>was</em> sent to kill Kal-El, it was because there was a curse he inherited that would break down the barrier to the Phantom Zone which Jor-El, Superman's father, had invented (this too would later be ignored), and that eventually Phantom Zone monsters would start crossing over to the real world unless Kal-El was killed. This origin was even verified as being correct by a Monitor... but then Supergirl's parents showed up and it turned out that her real origin was a modified version of her Silver Age origin (that a chunk of Krypton survived the destruction), and that everything else was the effects of Kryptonite poisoning making Supergirl crazy.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Donna Troy's</a> past is so complicated, writers are more likely to spend more time attempting to clean it up rather than chronicling her current adventures. To sum it up as briefly as possible:
<ul><li> After she spent the first 21 issues of the original <em>Teen Titans</em> series with no backstory, Marv Wolfman would establish that she was an orphan rescued from a burning apartment building by Wonder Woman. He would later expand upon the story in <em>New Teen Titans</em>, revealing that the couple that died weren't Donna's biological parents and that her mother had died after giving her up for adoption.
</li><li> After the Crisis on Infinite Earths rewrote continuity, Wonder Woman became a newcomer to the DC Universe. Since this meant Donna would predate her as a superhero, Wolfman and Perez then revised Donna's backstory to state that she was rescued by the Titans of Myth and sent back to Earth at the age 13 (with her memories wiped). She would then base her Wonder Girl costume off of the American flag.
</li><li> In the late '90s, John Byrne decided to apply his own retcon: Donna was actually a magical twin of Diana, created from a mirror and kidnapped by Dark Angel, who would then curse her to live multiple lives of tragedy. Byrne would also reveal that Donna based her "Wonder Girl" identity off of Hippolyta's Golden Age stint as Wonder Woman (via a time-traveling paradox).
</li><li> Allan Heinberg would finally use the mirror origin in stating that she was "born of magic", but would add that Wonder Woman rescued her and that the Amazons <em>and</em> Titans of Myth trained her.
</li><li> Lampshaded by Stjepan Sejic in <a class="urllink" href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/51/91/2c/51912cc92e66977e19d77c2b3bb13f3e.jpg">this one-off picture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> showing Wonder Girl signing copies of her new autobiography, "Your Guess Is As Good As Mine";
<div class="indent"><strong>Reader</strong>: Holy hell, this thing reads like a Choose Your Own Adventure! <br/><strong>Donna</strong>: Yeah, pretty much...
</div></li><li> Meredith Finch and Dan Abnett then created <em>their</em> brand new versions of Donna's backstory, wherein she's now a clay golem created by a group of Amazons to serve as a weapon. Under Finch's time as writer of <em>Wonder Woman</em>, Donna was never Wonder Girl and was created by the Amazon witch Derinoe to purge the island of the Amazon sons and usurp Diana as queen. Under Abnett's time as writer of <em>Titans</em>, Donna was indeed Wonder Girl at some point, and given fake memories by the Amazons to make her believe she'd been an abandoned orphan discovered by Wonder Woman.
</li></ul></li><li> In his first appearance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> villain Black Beetle claimed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a> of the 27th century. When revealed as a villain, he claimed to be Jaime Reyes' greatest enemy, who blamed Jaime for a death (and the final issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a></em> would strongly hint as to who he was) making him from the very near future. In a later appearance, Booster calls him "The Black Beetle, direct from the 22nd century. Or the 27th." to which the Beetle replies, "Or 15th. Whatever I choose to say for the sake of misdirection". Later, he had his first (from Jaime's point of view) encounter with Blue Beetle, in which he initially claimed to be the character the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a></em> story hinted at, before saying he wasn't; he <em>killed</em> that character. He follows this up by claiming to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">Jaime himself</a></em>.
</li><li> Played with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s first twelve issues of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supreme">Supreme</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcons</a> are part of the in-story universe, and the multiple past Supremes exist in their own dimension.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkman">Hawkman</a>'s past has so many embedded possibilities, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">Hell Lords</a> have one mutual origin, but most also have their own versions. It doesn't help that they are demons, so <em>everything</em> they say can be a lie and each story has set arguments and events that either supports or deny it.
<ul><li> The mutual story connects them to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Elder Gods</a>, the first generation of Earth gods. When evil god Set found out that he could steal the power of other gods by killing them, he caused the first war between gods. Gaea gave birth to Atum, who promised to destroy all evil gods. But their evil energy corrupted him, and he turned into the monstrous Demogorge, the God-Eater. Demogorge killed all gods who didn't escape to another dimension. Then he released all power he couldn't contain. This power has been consciously or unconsciously shaped by young humanity into the form of their fears, creating Hell-Lords, the first demons.
</li><li> Mephisto told his own version during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityGauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityGauntlet">The Infinity Gauntlet</a> crossover - in his version an abstract-equal being called Nemesis was lonely, so she created companions from her own essence, but forgot to give them good nature. When they all turned evil, she destroyed them and committed suicide. But her creations have somehow been reborn and become the first demons in the Universe. Mephisto claims to be one of them.
</li><li> Marduk Kurios claims to be both the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> and Babylonian god Marduk, who has degenerated into a demon, after he found that he could gain much more power from human souls than their belief.
</li><li> Satannish believes that he is the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimensionLord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DimensionLord">Dormammu, The Master Of Dark Dimension</a>.
</li><li> Lucifer has his classic biblical origin of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Fallen Angel</a> and denies any connection between him and other Hell Lords, but he's not different from them at all.
</li><li> Chthon has also claimed to be the first Demon.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Bullseye</a> has multiple tales about his past life: he is either a CIA agent, a baseball star... he makes up so many stories that no one knows who he really is. The only thing that remains consistent in his claims is that he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">he killed them</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>: Did Chase <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill someone because of/with his van</span>? Even he's not sure—he later admits that he made up stories to attempt to justify his father's abuse of him, and eventually started believing some of them. At one point, he seems extremely certain he <em>didn't</em>; later on, he seems totally certain that he <em>did</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Nico</strong>: You've told a few different versions of that story. <br/><strong>Chase</strong>: Right, well, in this one...
</div></li><li> Arcade, the theme park-themed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Professional Killer</a> who has menaced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> on numerous occasions, has told a number of different versions of his origin story, although they all involve him murdering his rich dad for his money. Since Arcade's real name is unknown, it could all be lies.
</li><li> And the trope is played <em>absolutely literally</em> in Vertigo Comics' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUnwritten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUnwritten">The Unwritten</a></em>, where the origin of Lizzie Hexam is structured like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gamebooks">Gamebook</a> comic: Is Lizzie Hexam actually a character who emerged from out of a Dickens novel, is she a victim of child abuse who gave up her body to a fictional construct, or simply a delusional girl? Did Wilson Taylor treat her like a daughter, like a prisoner, or like a science experiment?
<ul><li> Interestingly, while the reader can choose multiple paths for Lizzie, they all end with her at the press conference from issue #1. The subtext of this meshes very closely with Tom's words to Lizzie in the hospital: which story you decide to follow is more important than which one is true.
</li></ul></li><li> King Shark was introduced in Karl Kesel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy1994">Superboy</a></em> as <em>possibly</em> the son of a Hawaiian shark-god and a mortal woman. Later in the same run, Kesel introduced circumstantial evidence suggesting he was actually one of the mutated animals from the Wild Lands. Later still, Kesel's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a></em> confirmed the shark-god story.
</li><li> Heavily used in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSentry">The Sentry</a>, especially the relationship between him, his civilian identity Robert Reynolds and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> the Void: is the Void the result of a "mind virus" implanted by Mastermind? Are Sentry and the Void the good and evil nature that exist in every person given form by the serum Reynolds took? Is the Void a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a> formed by Reynolds' repression of his past as a thief and junkie? Is the Void Reynolds' <em>real</em> personality and the Sentry is the fake one? Or is the serum a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> and the Sentry is actually something else entirely like the Angel of Death? All of these were presented as equally likely. Which is pretty appropriate since Sentry is quite crazy. In fact, given that Sentry is crazy <em>and</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>, it's strongly suggested that the "true" version is <em>whatever he believes at the time</em>.
</li><li> The Time Trapper from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>, who at various points has been a Controller, a future version of his/her own sidekick, a future version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">Cosmic Boy</a>, a future version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfpint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfpint">Lori Morning</a>, and a future version of Superboy-Prime. Following that last revelation, Brainiac 5 hypothesised that the Trapper is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of failed timelines, and exactly what history leads to someone at the End of Time wearing a purple cloak and fighting the Legion changes every time the Trapper does anything.
</li><li> Teddy "Red" Herring of <em>Red Herring</em> is said to have an obviously false right eye (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity">though the art depicts it identically to his left</a>), and always has a different explanation for it: a childhood accident, shrapnel from a grenade in Iraq, a flesh-eating virus, the heel of a jealous ex-girlfriend... In all likelihood, none of these are true.
</li><li> Played with in <em>Batman: Joker's Daughter</em>; the Joker's Daughter has three entirely incompatable origins which she relives when the Anchorite uses her power on her. The twist is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> not only are <em>none</em> of them true, but her big secret (that she can't even admit to herself) is she never <em>had</em> an origin; she was living a life that was entirely unremarkable in every way, and just decided she wanted to be the Joker's Daughter</span>.
<ul><li> Played with even further with the original Joker's Daughter. Duela Dent claimed she was the daughter of several supervillains<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wst5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0wst5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wst5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Joker, Catwoman, Scarecrow, Riddler, Penguin, Two-Face, <em>Doomsday</em>, Dr. Light, Punch and Jewelee</span> before revealing herself as the daughter of Two-Face and Gilda Dent. Some time later Dick Grayson realized this couldn't be true because Duela is too old to be Two-Face's daughter, and Duela chides him for taking so long to figure that out. Post-Crisis, nobody was sure who she really was because her backstory kept changing, and not even she seemed to know who her dad was. It eventually turned out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she <em>is</em> the Joker's daughter. And Two-Face's. And the Riddler's. Duela originally came from Earth-3, where her biological parents were the Jokester and Three-Face, heroic versions of the Joker and (in this case, a female version of) Two-Face. Her stepfather was a heroic version of the Riddler. Duela somehow kept shifting between Earth-3 and the main DC Universe, explaining her confusion as a result of being shifted from universe to universe.</span>

Or did Doom simply miscalculate? Was Reed involved at all? Did Ben Grimm fuck with the machine?

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor">Asgardians</a>' stories can also contradict themselves, which is generally hand waved by either claiming it happened that way in a different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalRecurrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalRecurrence">Ragnarok cycle</a>, or going the Loki route and saying they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">living myth and metaphor</a> complete with invoking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FictionIdentityPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FictionIdentityPostulate">Fiction Identity Postulate</a>.

The creature simultaneously tells them three entirely contradictory stories, with the only points of similarity being that, whatever John's childhood was like, he attracted the attention of a powerful blindfolded figure (probably Tannarak?) who taught him enough magic to (accidentally?) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">kill his family</a>, and of course the Newcastle Incident (and even then, there are three possibilities of <em>how</em> John got involved in the Incident and what happened to him as a result - and they could easily be mixed-and-matched). In the end, John turns up to rescue the acolytes from their summoning, which has been feeding on them the more involved they become in the stories, and points out there's no reason to believe <em>any</em> of it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vampirella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vampirella">Vampirella</a> has two conflicting origin stories. Originally she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Alien</a> from the planet Drakulon which, you guessed it, is a world inhabited by vampires. When her character was resurrected in the 90s she was made into the daughter of Cain and Lilith, the latter of whom still ruled in Hell and created Vampirella so she could hunt down evil on Earth. The 2010 Dynamite series includes a blurb with every issue lampshading this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a>, implying that <em>both</em> stories may be true.

He also confided other origin stories to Cliff and the Negative Man. It was actually an elaborate ruse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedTheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeedTheMole">to discover the traitor by checking which story got leaked</a>. In the end, it turns out that none of those stories was the real one.
</li><li> Eobard Thawne/Professor Zoom/Reverse-Flash has quite a few different origins. There are five versions of Thawne's origin story, spanning over the various eras of DC:
<ul><li> In his pre-<em>Crisis</em> origin, he was a crook with a scientific background who discovered Barry Allen's Flash suit in a time capsule sent from the past to his home 25th century. Succeeding in using it to replicate Barry's powers, he then committed crimes with them before Barry arrived in his era and defeated him. Now enraged at Barry, Thawne decided to become the Flash's worst enemy, thus the whole time travel thing. He also developed a desire to replace Barry as Iris' husband and as the Flash.
</li><li> In his post-<em>Crisis</em> origin, written by Mark Waid in the famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheReturnOfBarryAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheReturnOfBarryAllen">The Return of Barry Allen</a>" storyline, it was changed so that his reason for hating Barry <em>before he met him</em> was that Thawne was a Flash fanboy who even had surgery to look like Barry Allen, along with recreating Barry's accident to give himself powers. He became the Flash of the 25th Century. Thawne traveled back in time to run alongside his hero, but missed the date and instead landed in the Wally West Flash era. He then discovers that he would become the Flash's worst villain, and all of this combined with the trauma of time travel made him snap. He impersonates Barry for a while, but is eventually defeated by Wally and sent back through time. The experience is erased from his memory, but he holds onto an instinctual hatred of the Flash as well as his Reverse-Flash costume, and it just so happens that he meets Barry "first". This explains how his extensive knowledge of Barry Allen and his desire to replace him came about.
</li><li> His post-<em>The Flash: Rebirth</em> origin is a combination of the above two. Here Eobard was still from the 25th century and was also genetically engineered to be intelligent. He formed an obsession with the heroes of the past, specifically the Flashes. He became his world's foremost leading expert on the Speed Force and head of the Flash Museum. Because of this, he was dubbed "Professor Zoom". Eventually, Thawne figured out how to replicate Flash's powers from a costume from a time capsule, and aimed to become a hero like his idol — but in the super-safe 25th century resorted to causing accidents himself that he'd then save people from. He eventually encountered Barry Allen as the Flash, and after Barry "ruined his life", he resolved to ruin Barry's.
</li><li> In the post-<em>Flashpoint</em>, New 52 retelling of his origin, Thawne came from a 25th century that idolized the Flash as a god. After witnessing his mother murdered by his father as a child and later gaining time alteration powers, Thawne attempts to conquer Central City but is opposed by the populace who fight against him in the Flash's name, motivating him to travel back in time, gather a group of similarly powered acolytes, and kill the Flash so that he goes down in history as a failure, not as a hero. He also notably never used the name "Reverse-Flash", instead going exclusively by Professor Zoom. This version was undone in <em>The Button</em>, which merged this Thawne with the post-<em>Flash: Rebirth</em> Thawne, with the latter's memories — and his previous origin — now dominant.
</li><li> The <em>Rebirth</em> version of Thawne's origin is essentially the post-<em>The Flash: Rebirth</em> origin, but it's expanded upon and there are some changes. Eobard is a child who grew up loving the Flash. Finding Barry's suit in a time capsule, he uses it to replicate Barry's powers in himself, becoming the Flash of the 25th Century. This time, he goes about causing accidents that he can save people from (it's not established if accidents are illegal like in the post <em>The Flash: Rebirth</em> origin). Encountering a time-travelling Barry Allen, the two bonded over their belief that time is valuable, and Thawne considers Barry telling him that "every second is a gift" the happiest day of his life. However, when Barry discovered Thawne's unethical ways of being a hero, he defeated him and turned him over to the authorities. Thawne genuinely repented, becoming curator of the Flash Museum (being dubbed a professor) and eventually donning a new costume based on Kid Flash's (it's basically his <em>Rebirth</em> suit but with the lightning bolt's direction the same as Barry's). However, when he travelled back in time to be with his hero once more, he discovered Barry was already mentoring Wally West. Seeing Barry tell Wally that "every second is a gift" and giving Wally his grandfather's watch with said quote engraved on it, Thawne was heartbroken. An enraged Thawne now believes his "bond" with Barry had all been lies on Barry's part and thus decided to fill Barry's life with the pain he was experiencing and make sure everyone knew what kind of person Barry really was.

She's since been written as a Chinese national, someone who grew up in the slums of an unspecified South-East Asian country, and a Chinese-American who was orphaned at an early age and grew up homeless. Her sister's murder has happened a couple of different ways with different perpetrators as well.

Isley" in college (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s Poison Ivy origin) and eating Swamp Thing as "the Seeder" (his <em>New 52</em> origin). Confusing things further, having usurped the position of the King of Petals, he also remembers Oleander Sorrel's origin story (from the <em>JLD</em> annual) as if it happened to him. Papa Midnite just thinks he's crazy.

</li><li> The tabletop game said he's on Earth as a result of cult rituals.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em> has two separate origins for General Grevious. The original origin was that he was Kaleesh warlord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">who was rebuilt as a cyborg by the Separatist after a shuttle crash</a> and agreed to lead the Separatist droid army in exchange for his homeworld's protection against attacks by the Kaleesh <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> the Huk and hated the Jedi due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Separatist brain tampering</a> and their refusal to help his people. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> instead viewed Grevious as a Jedi-wannabe who wasn't force-sensitive and gradually added cybernetic components to improve himself. Having respect for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, Dave Filoni had the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> episode "Lair Of Grevious" only hint at the later origin keeping things ambiguous. This technique was also done in <em>The Essential Guide To Warfare</em> where the author had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">two in-universe historians arguing over the two origins</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>The Offical Star Wars Fact File</em> would later make a reference to Grevious surviving an assassination attempt indicating the original origin is the canon one again.</span>
<ul><li> On a more minor note is the Death Star or more specifically who created it. Was it Raith Sinear? Was it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">Tarkin</a>? Was it the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Geonosians</a>? Or was it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallistaTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallistaTrilogy">Bevel Lemelisk</a>? Eventually the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar">Death Star</a></em> was released to sort things out. Short Answer, the creator was all of the above. Long Answer, the Death Star was a merger of two different concepts. The first was for a mobile planetoid (with a superlaser) made Sinear that Tarkin presented to Palpatine as his own concept. The second was for an ultimate weapon developed by the Geonosians for Count Dooku. The Geos brought Lemelisk to fix some design problems and he would go on help built the final product.
</li><li> Similarly there were two conflicting origins for the design of the Battle Droids in the Prequels. Most supplementary material released around the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> claimed they were based on skeletons of the Neimoidians with the heads being specifically a result their skulls changing their after they die due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a>. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> clearly shows they actually based on their Geonosian builders. <em>The Essential Guide To Warfare</em> decided to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> saying that they were modeled after the Geonosians, but the Neimoidian skull idea was also true and what <em>they</em> was the inspiration.
</li></ul></li><li> Jareth the Goblin King from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Labyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Labyrinth">Labyrinth</a></em>:
<ul><li> The music video to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidBowie">David Bowie's</a> song, <em>Underground</em>, implies that Jareth was originally a human from modern day Earth.
</li><li> The <em>Return To Labyrinth</em> manga says he's been ruling the Labyrinth for 1,300 years. The Labyrinth's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarniaTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarniaTime">Narnia Time</a> could handwave this coexisting with other origins.
</li><li> There's also an implication in the movie that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> whose default form is that of an owl, and who hijacked Sarah's imagination and created everything based on the play Sarah was reading, including his status as Goblin King.
</li><li> David Bowie himself stated he believed Jareth was someone who "inherited" his position rather than being a born king and played him as such.

Part of this is because several authors contributed to the Mythos and they sometimes had quite different views, but even the stories written by Lovecraft himself are not always consistent. For example, it is not clear if Mt. Kadath and the plateau of Leng exist in the real world (their only actual appearance is in the Dreamland stories, but they're mentioned as real world locations in other stories) or whether Cthulhu himself is a Great Old One or not (in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCallOfCthulhu">The Call of Cthulhu</a>" he's mentioned to be one of Them, in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDunwichHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDunwichHorror">The Dunwich Horror</a>" he's referred as Their "cousin"). This is likely because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P.

He tells Wendy of how after being adopted into Neverland, he tried to return home to his parents only to find the window locked and another little boy in his room, and he uses this as his justification for disliking adults. The narration of the book says something along the lines of "this may or may not be what happened; but it's how Peter remembered it at the time and thus he wholeheartedly believed it."

Then <em>more</em> characters come into the story, and they have their own stories about his past. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's hundreds of years old, has never physically aged past 23, and he was <em>every one</em> of these people.</span>
<ul><li> Either confusing pasts was a theme with Zelazny, or he just had trouble making up his mind when he was writing a story: the Chronicles of Amber involves <em>dozens</em> of "histories" for Corwin, and he spends much of the series trying to unravel which ones are true. (Adding to the confusion: Corwin is immortal, he can travel to as many worlds as he wants, there are "shadows" of him in a lot of those worlds, <em>and</em> he has about 15 siblings with similar powers who all lie and scheme and plot.)
</li><li> Zelazny's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfLight">Lord of Light</a></em> mentions a woman who was Sam's "mother or daughter or wife, or perhaps all three," which seems tricky even with reincarnation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, this turns out to be foreshadowing of the fact that the same woman, in three different bodies, may have ended up being all three to Yama. As Durga, she was of the correct generation to be Yama's mother; as Kali, she was Yama's wife; and, at the end, as the mentally damaged Murga, she is his adopted daughter.</span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> never managed to come up with a satisfactory backstory for the Orcs; he had created them so his bad guys had some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> mooks, but this clashed with his Catholic beliefs that no free willed being could be pure evil. Origins for the Orcs include: corrupted Elves (featured in the published <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">Silmarillion</a>), corrupted Men (although this doesn't fit the timeline), intelligent animals (Contradictory to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Cirith Ungol chapter of Return of the King</a>) or simply primitive tribes.
<ul><li> Also true of Galadriel and Celeborn  <em>Unfinished Tales</em> gives multiple drafts of their history that Tolkien wrote, with no clear chronology to tell us which version is the latest (and presumably most authoritative, though some versions cause other continuity problems) and with more notes that suggest Tolkien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">was planning on revising it again before the publication</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>.

<ul><li> The Doctor has multiple conflicting backstories, due in part to the evolving nature of the show. They might be from the 49th century ("An Unearthly Child" pilot), they might be a child born into privilege ("The Deadly Assassin") or from poverty ("Listen"), they might have learned spiritual lessons from Time Lord hermits on the hill where they lived ("The Time Monster") or have been raised in the metropolis of the Capitol ("Invasion of Time"), have been woven as a young adult on a genetic loom, incorporating the biodata of the Other, an enigmatic Gallifreyan founding figure ("Lungbarrow") or been born half-human (the TV Movie), they might have had multiple incarnations before the First Doctor ("The Brain of Morbius", "Cold Fusion"), might have abandoned their family ("An Unearthly Child") or have some sort of relationship with their mother ("The End of Time"), might have built the TARDIS themself ("The Chase") or stolen it ("The War Games"), and their madness might originate from a childhood visit from Clara ("Listen"), staring into the Time Vortex as a child ("Utopia") or political issues forcing them to escape, with the time travel itself causing their madness along the way (audio drama "The Beginning" and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/Gallifrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/Gallifrey">Gallifrey</a></em> series). They could also be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an adopted being from another universe known as "The Timeless Child" who was used as the source of the early Gallifreyans' ability to regenerate, enabling them to become the Time Lords, and may have lived enough lives for all these backstories to be true without them even knowing it entirely</span>. ("The Timeless Children"). Some of these are reconcilable, others aren't, and overall the show doesn't care about nailing the character down like that, as it's not really the point.
</li><li> Susan, the Doctor's granddaughter, receives this to a lesser extent, primarily as a result of expanded universe stories desexualising Gallifrey/the Doctor - if she isn't the Doctor's granddaughter, then she might be the Other's granddaughter, and thus the Doctor's via reincarnation ("Lungbarrow"), an orphaned descendant of Rassilon ("Birth of a Renegade"), the daughter of a Time Lord President ("A Brief History of Time Lords"), or perhaps the Doctor's granddaughter from a previous regeneration cycle ("Cold Fusion").
</li><li> <em>Doctor Who</em> has explained away the creation of the Daleks in three different ways. Once in their debut story "The Daleks" (which didn't actually show it), a second time in a spin-off comic <em>The Dalek Chronicles</em> (which didn't contradict the first origin story) and finally in "Genesis of the Daleks". <br/><br/>Terry Nation wrote a book in the late '80s that reconciled "The Daleks" with "Genesis of the Daleks." Basically, the Daleks in "The Daleks" were a prototype Davros made before "Genesis of the Daleks." Their city was an experiment to see if Daleks could function autonomously. After he left them alone and got buried in rubble in the Kaled/Thal genocide, those Daleks wrote Davros out of their official history, preferring to ignore the fact that an "inferior" being had created them.
</li><li> The series explained in "The Three Doctors" that Omega created the Time Lords by creating a black hole artificially. "The Deadly Assassin" says Rassilon did it. Later stories have reconciled the two explanations. (Rassilon and Omega were partners, Omega did the actual testing and got sucked into the black hole, Rassilon brought home the results)
</li><li> Averted in New Who with the Cybermen: an alternative origin story, in which the Cybermen are invented on Earth by a wealthy human attempting to prevent his own death, is set in an alternate universe. The Mondas Cybermen didn't show up until 2010 (not counting the museum piece in "Dalek").
</li><li> In the 2017 series finale, the Doctor claims the various origins of the Cybermen across the show's media are actually a case of "parallel evolution". They're <em>all</em> true, as the Cybermen will come into being wherever the right technology exists.

Unusually, the Doctor points out, and Amy agrees, that it's all <em>fine</em>, that there's no problem caused by having two incompatible pasts — although Amy feels like there <em>should</em> be. She is, in fact, remembering an alternate timeline that actually happened, but then the entire Universe got rebooted.

The underlying reason was that the show had a new producer, the concept had been overhauled and Mac's backstory was rewritten to eliminate his association with the military. The retcon also added a retroactive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesis">Arch-Nemesis</a>, Murdoc.

</li><li> Parker from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> has had several flashbacks to her past, which appear to all be true, but are somewhat contradictory: the first episode shows Parker, age 9 or so, running away from home after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">blowing up her foster parents</a> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">they yelled at her for stealing</a>, another episode indicates that she was raised as an orphan, and another revealed she had a younger brother who was killed in an accident when she was twelve. All of these can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">rationalized</a> by her having one or more foster families, but it's still confusing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, Jack O'Neill's backstory throughout most of the series was that he was ex-Special Ops, and O'Neill wore a master parachutist's badge and later a space and missile operations badge on his dress uniform but never pilot's wings, but in an episode of Season Eight, Samantha Carter pointed out that he used to be a test pilot. This is likely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">ass-pull</a> by the writers, but given that he did pilot some experimental aircraft and that this backstory was never mentioned again, and that the only occasion when the viewers find out anything about O'Neill's background is when someone else mentions it, it's possible that Carter herself was mistaken.
<ul><li> Also, Vala's past. She was brought up on a nice planet with a conventional life (and fiancé) until she was chosen by Qetesh, OR she was sold to a weapons dealer and killed him to earn her freedom, OR she was brought up by her bitchy stepmother and conman father, and also <em>how</em> many times was she married? Vala is a habitual liar and loves to tell fanciful stories (especially in her earlier appearances, before her character development). The only things we know for sure is that she really was host to Qetesh at some point in her past, and she really does have a conman father. Beyond that, we may never know.

It was eventually revealed he was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> Roman Brady and that was the role the actor was billed as for many years and lived through his "wife's" "death". Then they decided to bring back he original Roman/Marlena super couple, so it was revealed that "Roman" wasn't the real deal after all and went back to calling himself John Black. In the years since, he's had it revealed that he'd been a cop, private investigator, and a priest in his past. There have been at least two separate revelations about who his birth parents are. The current origin puts him as a cousin of some sort to Roman Brady and also related to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. In the meantime, Wayne Northrop, the original Roman left the show again after a short time. That role was recast in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">The Other Darrin</a> and now played by someone who'd previously played a different role on the show.

She was the middle of three sisters, then a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gay</span> brother appeared. She had three sons and a daughter, but two different daughters were named during the show's run. It is also unclear whether or not she was faithful to her husband George - one episode says yes, another says no. And don't anyone ask her age. Sophia also liked to make up preposterous stories about her past ("Picture it..."). These were played for laughs, usually inserting herself into trysts and feuds with famous people, and were (mostly?) made up.

This prompted Craig to respond, upon hearing the second, with the joke "How the heck does someone drive a motorcycle into a shark?!" (The two accounts given that episode being first that he had died in a shark attack, and the second being a motorcycle accident resulting from failure to wear a helmet.)

Other versions say that the name was suggested not by Lennon, but by early bassist Stu Sutcliffe.

Another theory comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> suggesting that they got the name from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a> film <em>The Wild One,</em> in which a motorcycle gang is referred to as "The Beetles."

<ul><li> In any body of mythological stories, this tends to happen over time as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">multiple authors</a> have their own ideas, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">whole towns or regions</a> may have different versions of a story.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>, for example, different authors gave different parents to many heroes, monsters and deities, and told events in their pasts differently. The Kabeiroi, Kouretes, and Korybantes, related sets of minor deities, had several different genealogies and origin stories. Humanity itself had separate creation myths in different cities, along with different explanations for how they got fire, writing, and so forth.
<ul><li> There were two stories of why Hephaestus had a bad limp: either he was born lame, or Zeus threw him off of Mount Olympus during a quarrel and he was injured in the fall. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Homer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Homer">Homer</a> told both versions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIliad">The Iliad</a></em>.
</li><li> Aphrodite has three mutually exclusive accounts of where she came from. One version of her myth says she's the daughter of Zeus and the titaness Dione, the second version says she was created when Ouranos' severed testicles landed in the sea and the third version (the most obscure version, mostly exclusive to the Spartans and a few others) doesnt completely specify her origins, but depicts her as a goddess of both love and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">war</a> instead of just love.
</li><li> Athena was either born from Zeus alone, or she is the daughter of Zeus and his first wife Metis (in both origins, she still bursts out from Zeuss head, but for different reasons).
</li><li> There are several myths concerning different accounts of what Dionysus was doing in the mortal world before he joined the rest of his family in Olympus. Some say he was a wanderer who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">walked the Earth</a>, others say that he was a madness-inducing conqueror who developed a mad cult of debauchery who brought chaos to whoever opposed Dionysus, other origin stories have varying accounts of those events and other origins stories dont mention what he was doing before becoming a god at all.
</li><li> Several monsters in Greek mythology are also prone to this. Arachne and Medusa are good examples. In well-known versions of their stories, they both got screwed over by Athena and got turned into monsters out of anger and spite. However, earlier versions of those stories instead suggest that Athena didnt turn Arachne into a spider out of anger or spite, but for other reasons (because in those versions, Arachne commited suicide after their weaving contest and when Athena learned this, she decided to resurrect Arachne by turning her into a spider out of respect and pity). And earlier versions of Medusas story suggest that her origin has nothing to do with Athena or Poseidon and that she was always a gorgon.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/EgyptianMythology">Ancient Egyptian authors</a> also differed on the parentage of various gods. This isn't surprising, given that such family relations were often more a matter of local cult rather than "myth" as such. By the end of the New Kingdom, many gods were worshipped in threesomes identified as husband, wife, and son, and temples in different regions used different combinations of gods.

<ul><li> Done with the entire <em>species</em> of illithids (aka Mind Flayers). One of the earlier versions says that they're mutants outcast from a long-gone human society in the Astromundi crystal sphere (solar system). Another version puts them as emerging when parasites from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror">the Outside</a>" entered the game's reality and began <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">bonding with and mutating</a> humanoids, and went on to rule an interstellar empire millennia ago which has since fallen.

A later version says they're <em>from the future</em> and traveled back in time to escape a nameless enemy that was destroying them, and to prepare better for that enemy while in the past. It's ultimately left up to the Game Master to decide which of these is the "truth," or if perhaps they're all successive layers of lies used to disguise the illithids' origins and that the latest retcon is just another lie. However, in the 4th Edition rules, Mind Flayers are once again from the Far Realm - beyond the borders of the universe. This certainty may be only because there haven't been enough years into the new edition to let their webs of deceit get fully developed yet, however.
<ul><li> An interesting but ultimately unrelated note on the time-traveling origin: A person can still take "Heritage" feats, special character options that indicate one's bloodline co-mingles with that of the relevant race/species (Fey Heritage, Draconic Heritage, etc) for Illithids. For most heritage feats, this implies an ancestry speckled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Interspecies Romance</a>.

Rather, it came from escaped slaves who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchedByVorlons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchedByVorlons">experimented upon by the illithids</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The game's 4th Edition default setting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NentirVale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NentirVale">Nentir Vale</a></em> does this with pretty much all of the deities. Fairly justified; they've been around for so long that the details of their origins are wrapped up in legends. Notably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Asmodeus</a> has been given probably the most information on his origins, most of them being at least somewhat contradictory.
<ul><li> And then there's the Raven Queen. Depending on what you look at, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> goddess of death as part of the life cycle, an evil former consort of Nerull who overthrew him to gain his title as God of the Dead and now plots to destroy the other Gods so she can gain that title that she believes is rightfully hers rather than her lesser title of Goddess of Death, or a selfish and power-hungry goddess that epitomizes the reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> is now Unaligned.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The origin story for Strahd von Zarovich, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a> setting's most iconic villain, has been recounted in two novels, four to six adventures (depending on whether or not updates count), and dozens of fragmentary anecdotes throughout the product line. Not only do they contradict one another in numerous details, but it's openly acknowledged that many such accounts are propaganda and that <em>Strahd himself</em> probably doesn't remember (or <em>want</em> to remember) the truth anymore. Plus, there's a completely separate and irreconcilable version of Strahd in <em>Ravenloft II: The House on Gryphon Hill</em> that even the <strong>publishers</strong> wrote off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">Riddle for the Ages</a>.
</li><li> <em>World of Darkness</em> gamelines tend to play with this. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em>, pretty much everything regarding the how and why of the War of Rage, the creation story of the Triat, and the birth of the were-races are told from the point of view of a member of whichever race the book you're reading is about, and so every version is from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>.
<ul><li> Similarly with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>, which isn't surprising, given the Kindred raise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> to an artform. The primary account of vampire origins is the story of Caine, and it's the one that's treated as essentially true by the setting. But there's no consistent account of what happened after Caine became a vampire, how many of the Second and Third Generations there actually were, or how each of the clans came to be - not to mention that some clans, like the Ravnos and Setites, have versions of their origins that say they arose independently of Caine.
</li><li> <em>Beckett's Jyhad Diary</em> throws in what the Laibon, the African vampires, have to say on the subject, holding that vampires have been around as long as humans, and that Caine, though historically significant, was not the first vampire. One Laibon NPC says he cursed himself with vampirism, rather than being Embraced by another.
</li><li> There's also the Rasputin situation. Numerous historical characters were written into the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em>. Two different writers used Rasputin as a character, not knowing about the other's use of him, and their versions had two different backstories. When this discrepancy was pointed out, the company decided to run with it. Several writers began using Rasputin as a character, giving him a different backstory each time. These multiple versions of Rasputin became one of the unsolved mysteries of the original <em>World of Darkness</em>, though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WraithTheOblivion">Wraith: The Oblivion</a></em> tried to reconcile them by saying that Rasputin is actually a body-hopping wraith who likes possessing various supernaturals, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> suggested the Rasputins know about their other versions, seeing themselves as "brothers", and that there's a terrible truth behind them.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>, multiple explanations are given for several aspects of the game world so that the Storyteller may pick and choose which ones she likes.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em>, for example, there are several possible reasons for why the Gentry may kidnap humans and how the True Fae come to be:
<ul><li> Their existence in Arcadia was actually totally devoid of emotion or nuance until they experienced the Glamour from human proximity,
</li><li> Or they're actually constructs of wild magic and chaotic emotions, and exposure to humans gave them sentience,
</li><li> OR they're actually what remains of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">the mages</a> who climbed the Celestial Ladder and entered the Supernal Realm, but their imperfect human desires ran amok and destroyed their humanity.
</li><li> Or they're latecomers to Arcadia of unknown origin, and will one day leave.
</li><li> Even if one (or more) of the above are true, it didn't explain how there could be <em>so many</em> of the True Fae until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you read the supplement book that says that Changelings who reach Wyrd 10 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityMeter">Clarity</a> 0 are likely to <em>become</em> True Fae themselves.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> So far, we have two separate explanations for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTunguskaEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTunguskaEvent">The Tunguska Event</a>: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean</a> tried to summon an arch-<em>qashmal</em>, or one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil">Knights of St. George</a> tried to summon a Faceless Angel. Or that those are actually two versions of the <em>same</em> story...
</li><li> And then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Atlantis</a>. Atlantis could have been a real ancient city ruled by mages, or it could be an allegory made real by the minds of Awakened souls, or it could be a far-future event whose collapse was felt eons in the past. The sourcebook mentions that some members of the Free Council believe Atlantis is a lie that the other factions made up to justify their dominance.
</li><li> And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken">the Uratha</a> have so many tales of lost Pangaea it's not worth sorting here.
</li><li> Also, in contrast with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a>, where they had a defined and known origin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">vampires</a> in the New World of Darkness have long forgotten exactly how they came to be, meaning each faction has its own ideas of their origin. (Indeed, there's a fair case to be made that vampires have multiple origins.)
</li><li> Was the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Frankenstein</a> created by Victor Frankenstein, as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">the original novel</a>, or was he created by Mary Shelley and John Polidori from the remains of the last of the previous choler-aspected Lineage, the Amirani? <em>Dark Eras Companion</em> explicitly brings up this trope in a sidebar, declaring it's up to the Storyteller to decide the circumstances around the Frankensteins' creation.
</li><li> On a similar note, did the first Zeka start being created in 1945, beginning with the Trinity bomb test, or did they originate before that?

<ul><li> Cedric the Bull, the main villain of the Knights Kingdom 1 sub theme of Castle, has two completely different backstories depending on what you read. A US Lego Mania Magazine says that he used to be one of King Leo's knights who got a little power hungry and betrayed the king wanting to rule the kingdom for himself. However according to a story book called <em>Medieval Mischief and Mayhem</em>, the manual for the PC Creator Knights Kingdom game and a flash book from the theme's old and now gone website instead states that he's the 13th son of an unknown king(thereby making him a prince)of a land faraway from Leo's kingdom. Then when the king died he left his land to be divided up and ruled by his his sons, all the princes got a share of land except for Cedric which resulted in him traveling far away from his homeland, going rogue, finding Leo's kingdom and developing an obsession of taking over and ruling Leo's land for himself. While is not clear on which is the canon backstory it possibly is the latter one due to it being used in three different sources while the former one is only used in one source. Plus the latter story does make Cedric a more interesting villain and it kinda makes you feel a little sorry for him, the former story is rather bland, cliche and makes Cedric sound waaay to similar to Vladek from the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/KnightsKingdom2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/KnightsKingdom2">Knights' Kingdom</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Given that continuity in <em>Transformers</em> is, well, <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Continuity">pretty tangled<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Multiple Choice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canon</a> is more of a rule rather than an exception, meaning aspects like the origins of the Transformer race differ between franchises and even series within said franchises (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">the G1 cartoon</a> claims the Quintessons made the Transformers, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">the concurrent Marvel comic</a> established the godlike Primus as their creator).
</li><li> Then you have characters like Unicron. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersTheMovie">Originally</a>, he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere">random planet-eating Transformer</a> with no backstory (until the cartoon claimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">he was made by an ancient space monkey</a>). Then Simon Furman's run on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Marvel comic</a> turned him into a godlike Satanic archetype opposed by a being named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">Primus</a>; this interpretation caught on more in later adaptations than the original Primacron story. However, Unicron (as well as a few other legendary figures) was once established as a "multiversal singularity", which basically means that every depiction of him across the franchise was the same individual... before the concept was done away with almost a decade later and every iteration of him became a different individual with a different past.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em> applies this to the entire country of Termina. Anju's grandmother says Termina was an ancient land created by the Giants. The manual repeatedly refers to it as a parallel world to Hyrule. Some sources say that Termina is an offshoot of Hyrule created when the goddesses sent their power through the cracks of the land. <em>Hyrule Encyclopedia</em> claims that Termina is a figment of the Skull Kid's imagination given life by Majora's Mask.
<ul><li> The Skull Kid himself is given this treatment. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> he was said to be a child who got lost in the Lost Woods and was cursed into his current form. According to Anju's grandma however he is an ancient being who was once friends with the Four Giants and became a trickster due to his resentment that his friends left him and was threatened into exile by them as punishment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteambotChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SteambotChronicles">Steambot Chronicles</a></em> had a literal version of this, where after meeting with Mallow you can recover from your amnesia and reveal your past. Or not, if you didn't feel inclined. Unfortunately, this leads to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PausedInterrupt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PausedInterrupt">incredibly stilted</a> dialog in the following scenes.
<div class="indent">[Name] is... the son of a baker... <em>fast</em>... ...and a lone wolf.
</div></li><li> As if the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> lore didn't see enough changes/retcons, the setting also features a fair dosage of time travel. Certain forces can tamper with the timeline, while the Bronze Dragonflight tries to fix it. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, the Caverns of Time feature a set of dungeons where the players assist them by whatever means possible. For instance, there are two versions of Thrall's escape from imprisonment: either a bloodless escape during a distraction, or a group of strangers assaulting the keep and a nearby town. Although at the end of that one, the bronze dragon that was guiding you implies that after you've destroyed the last of the Infinite Dragons who were trying to alter the time stream, he would alter events so that the original bloodless escape is what everyone will remember.
</li><li> This is quite literally true for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Commander Shepard</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>. At character creation, Shepard's appearance, gender and military specialization are filled in by the player, as well as two different sets of background details, with three choices each. The backgrounds offer unique missions and dialogue during the games, and affect the amount of Paragon and Renegade points you start with.
<ul><li> The Pre-Service History choices are these:
<ul><li> <strong>Colonist</strong>: Shepard was born in the colony of Mindoir, which was later sacked by the Batarians, with Shepard barely escaping being sold into slavery. Choosing this background grants you a middling amount of Paragon/Renegade points, and grants access to a unique mission where Shepard helps out Talitha, a fellow Mindoir survivor who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">Made a Slave</a> by the Batarians and is now traumatized.
</li><li> <strong>Earthborn</strong>: Shepard was an orphan raised on the streets of Earth, escaping poverty and gang violence by enlisting in the military as soon as s/he could. Choosing this background grants you the most Renegade points, and gives you a unique assignment where you deal with your old gang, the Tenth Street Reds, and their attempt to free a member arrested by the Turians.
</li><li> <strong>Spacer</strong>: Shepard's parents were both in the military, and s/he spent your childhood transferring around ships and stations as they went from posting to posting, never having a permanent home. Choosing this background grants you the most Paragon points, and means that Shepard's mother, Hannah Shepard, is still alive and a captain in the Alliance military, allowing you to have several conversations with her.
</li></ul></li><li> The Psychological Profile choices are these:
<ul><li> <strong>Sole Survivor</strong>: Shepard's squad was massacred by a Thresher Maw on Akuze. Choosing this background grants a mix of Paragon and Renegade points, and alters the playthrough of a mission where you meet another survivor of the Thresher Maw attack (who was the sole survivor of the squad if this background was not chosen), who reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganization">Cerberus</a> was behind the attack, and kidnapped and experimented on him.
</li><li> <strong>War Hero</strong>: Shepard was recognized as a war hero for his/her role in repelling the Skyllian Blitz, an attack on the colony of Elysium by Batarian slavers (Whatever the background, Shepard was present at the Blitz, but War Hero Shepard rallied the colonists against the invaders and single-handedly sealed a breach in their defenses). Choosing this path grants extra Paragon points, and alters the playthrough of a mission where you tangle with the mastermind behind the Blitz.
</li><li> <strong>Ruthless</strong>: Shepard was involved in the Alliance's attack on Torfan in retaliation for the Skyllian Blitz, and took heavy losses to massacre all the Batarians there, even the ones who surrendered, giving him/her the title "The Butcher of Torfan". Choosing this path grants extra Renegade points and alters the playthrough of a mission where another soldier who was at Torfan (and knows Ruthless Shepard) has started to amass a biotic cult.
</li></ul></li><li> Thanks to the save import feature in both <em>Mass Effect</em> sequels, Multiple Choice Past extends to the storyline of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">later</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">games</a> in the trilogy, which can be affected in subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways based on choices you made in a previous game. To compensate for those without save games to transfer, Mass Effect also offers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">DLC</a> that allows you to make the biggest choices in the prior game, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saving or killing the council and which teammate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">dies</a> on Virmire in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a>, or whether you destroyed or saved the Collector Base in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></span> by making a choice on a multiple-choice style quiz in the prologue.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em>, you have the option in several conversations to choose certain aspects of what happened in your past, as well as what happened in the first game. You can even choose the non-canon Dark Side endings for the first game, and the rest of the game will change to fit with those events instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game takes this to a whole new level with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>: each of the six available "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode">Origins</a>" for the Warden has a separate starting quest chain, with a follow-up in one of the main story quests later on. It is implied that all six origins occurred, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersPlayerCharacter">the five not chosen by the player were killed because of Duncan's absence</a>.
</li><li> In-story, Flemeth combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>. At least two different versions of her story, the legend and the story she told Morrigan, have been told thus far, and Morrigan even says she doubts Flemeth told her the truth.
<ul><li> Her true origins are finally revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Inquisition</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She was once a human woman who was imbued with the soul of the Elven God Mythal</span>. However, she speaks vaguely enough about her past life that the previous stories could potentially have happened as well, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> at least if you substitute Mythal for the demon that supposedly possessed her</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> provides one of three choices for how the game begins from the first game (aside from importing a save file from <em>Origins</em>): "Hero of Ferelden" (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> Human Noble defeated the Archdemon and survived the fifth Blight, Alistair is king of Ferelden), "The Martyr" (a cynical Dalish Elf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificed herself</a> to kill the Archdemon and end the blight, Alistair and Anora marry and rule Ferelden together), or "No Compromise" (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">Determinator</a> Dwarven Noble let another Grey Warden die to defeat the Archdemon, Alistair is exiled from Ferelden, and Anora is queen).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>: The player can choose to be either a Human, Elf, Dwarven or Qunari (well, Vashoth) Inquisitor. They have different explanations for being at the cataclysmic event at the beginning of the game, but they aren't playable like in <em>Origins</em> - the story always starts in the same place. The player does, however, get to flesh out their backstory in conversations, either describing past events of their lives or simply stating their opinion on certain parts of their background. Like the Warden, it is implied that all four were present at the Conclave, but the three not chosen were killed by the Breach.
<ul><li> In a semi-continuation from <em>Dragon Age II</em>, Varric's codex mentions that he will always give a different story for how he got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallHerVera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICallHerVera">Bianca</a>. He'll tell you how he got her early in the game, but multiple playthroughs will reveal that he changes that story as well. But in a late-game sidequest, we finally learn Bianca's true story... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">we think</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> really does love this trope. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>, most classes (barring the Warrior and Inquisitor) touch on the player's past but both the Republic Trooper and the Imperial Agent have certain backstory details revealed based on particular factors.
<ul><li> The Republic Trooper is either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat">top graduate at the Academy</a> (Light-Sided) or has been fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">they were old enough to hold a blaster</a> and an underground resistance movement (neutral or Dark-Sided)
</li><li> The Imperial Agent based on species specific dialogue options on Voss is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel">former member of the Imperial military</a> that descended from the original exiles that settled Dromund Kass (Human or Cyborg) a former of the Chiss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleReverseQuadrupleAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleReverseQuadrupleAgent">who may or may not still be working for them</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">Street Urchin</a> who was found by Imperial Intelligence and sensed "something greater in them"
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering">The Suffering</a></em>, your actions in the game dictate how Torque's family died via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>. There are three endings. In the good ending, they were murdered and you were framed. In the neutral one, Torque killed them by accident, and in the bad ending, he murdered them all.
</li><li> The player character gets to choose his/her own past in the character creation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade  Bloodlines</a></em>. This only affects stats though, not the actual story.
<ul><li> This was originally cut from the game and was reintroduced by an official patch.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmnesiaOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AmnesiaOtome">Amnesia: Memories</a></em>, the café manager Waka has a mysterious past and background that changes for each route the player is currently going through, which also changes his personality. Heart World implies that he's trained in theater and dance and acts rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight">Camp Straight</a>, while Spade World and Joker World make his background be military-based. In the former, he's a hothead and treats his business like a battlefield, while the latter has his background closer to that of an assassin and specifically mentions guerilla-fighter tactics.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>
<ul><li> Was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Talos</a> a divinely chosen warrior from the ancient Atmora who achieved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">apotheosis</a> by his own merit or just a shrewd politician from High Rock with powerful friends? Possibly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">both</a></em>. After achieving divinity, it is possible that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">retroactively re-wrote his life</a>. Many things credited to Talos were originally actions and traits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergerOfSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MergerOfSouls">different individuals</a>, including Tiber Septim, Zurin Artcus, and Wulfharth Ash-King. (With the latter two also possibly merged into the same "Underking" identity.)
</li><li> Similarly, the history of Vivec and the entire account of the events during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenItAllBegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenItAllBegan">Battle of Red Mountain</a> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">several vastly different and conflicting versions</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">all of which can be true at the same time.</a> Vivec may have originally been a low-born, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">devious general</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Nerevar</a>'s but similar to the above example of Talos, might have made his fantastic origin story as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">demigod</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">warrior poet</a> true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">retroactively with his acquired divine power</a>.
</li><li> Sources conflict greatly on the early history of the races of Men. The most popular theory, espoused most prominently by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">propaganda of the Septim Empire</a>, is that all of the races of Men (save for the Yokudan Redguards) descend from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Nedes</a>, who originally hailed from the northernmost continent of Atmora. However, other sources indicate that the Nedes were among Tamriel's many indigenous human tribes (or may have been the collective name for these tribes) from whom the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage">Imperials</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid">Bretons</a> get their human ancestry while the actual Atmorans were a distinct race of Men who came over in the early 1st Era and settled in Skyrim, interbreeding with the Nedes to create the modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>. In either case, there is evidence of habitation by humanity in Tamriel which predates the earliest known dates of Atmoran migration. Even the creation of the races of Men is unclear. The most prominent theory is that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Ehlnofey</a> who would become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">the races of Mer</a> and the Ehlnofey who would become the races of Men ("Wanderers") split <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTimeOfMyths">very early in world history</a> following a great war between the two factions. However, Altmeri religious beliefs (dating back to the ancient Aldmer) state that Men were created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">Lorkhan</a> out of the "weakest souls" to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">spread chaos throughout all corners of creation</a>.
</li><li> The Tsaesci are supposedly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai">Akaviri</a> race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople">Snake Vampires</a> complete with serpentine lower bodies. However, sources differ radically as to whether they are actually serpentine or humans just like those found in Tamriel.
<ul><li> On the "human-like" side: Several in-game books outright state that they are humans little different from those in Tamriel. One account specifically mentions a Tsaesci soldier with an injured leg. The most recent (and probably most reliable) account, Uriel V's campaign report from the 3rd Era, does not describe them as snake-like at all. It also mentions them having "mounted raiders," which would be a difficult task for a species without legs. The Akaviri ghosts and skeletons who appear at a few points in the series are completely humanoid in appearance.
</li><li> On the "serpentine" side: <em>Mysterious Akavir</em>, a work of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">admittedly dubious accuracy</a>, supports this side. Additionally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel">in-universe historical fiction</a> (loosely based on in-universe historical events) <em>2920, The Last Year of the First Era</em> also describes them as having serpentine lower bodies. Other chronicles, such as "History of the Fighter's Guild" indicate that the Tsaesci couldn't wear human armor at all, indicating a non-humanoid shape. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">The Elder Scrolls Online</a></em> has an item, an Akaviri Silver Mask, which depicts a reptilian-looking appearance.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>-option: Since the "races" of Akavir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedAfterTheirPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedAfterTheirPlanet">share their names with the name of their nation</a>, it's possible that they aren't one single "race," but multiple races living within those nations. The "Tsaesci" could include serpentine snake vampires as well as the former Men of Akavir and/or their cross bred descendants.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, there are many conflicting theories regarding the origins of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">Giants</a>:
<ul><li> One of the most popular, especially among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>, is that they share an ancestry with the ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Atmorans</a>. The Atmorans were known to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge">tall, strong</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarbarianTribe">somewhat primitive</a>. According to this theory, after coming to Tamriel from the northern continent of Atmora, the Atmorans split into two groups - one who would interbreed with Tamriel's Nedes to become the modern Nords - and another who would, through unknown means, become the progenitors of the Giants.
</li><li> Other sources, however, make it clear that Giants existed in Tamriel before the Atmorans crossed the sea. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Dwemer</a> were said to have gotten the nickname "Dwarves" from Giants they encountered in the Velothi Mountains after splitting off from the Aldmer, which occurred well before the Atmoran migration. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Aldmer</a> themselves drove a "multi-eyed" race of Giants known as the Ilyadi to extinction when they first settled the Summerset Isles, which was even earlier. Standard Giants also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointedEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointedEars">pointed, tapered ears</a> like those of the Mer (Elves).
</li><li> In either case, there are known instances of Giants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSkittyOnWailordAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSkittyOnWailordAction">interbreeding and producing offspring</a> with the other races of Tamriel, particularly Nords. This would suggest that, at the very least, Giants have a shared ancestry with the other races dating back to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Ehlnofey</a>, a progenitor race from whom all extant races (save for <em>perhaps</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizard Folk</a> Argonians) descend.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the origin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Vampires</a> in Tamriel is not clear cut. While the general scholarly consensus is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProgenitor">Lamae Beolfag</a> was indeed the first vampire, there are other origin stories as well. Given the numerous other vampire bloodlines and tales of other individuals acquiring Vampirism directly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Molag Bal</a> as well, it's possible that each of these stories has some truth to them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em>, the player can choose to determine their character's class, reputation, ethics, abilities, etc, through an extensive survey of his background... or can choose to have it all automatically generated. One of the questions asks what item you received as a gift from the emperor. If you choose the Ebony Dagger, you start the game with that weapon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">which is substantially superior to other weapons at that level</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em> has a set of questions in the character creation that asks you about your character's past. This sets up your character's starting stats and equipment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Having a canon that's basically built on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a> (as well as implied), has a few different origin stories. Americans of the 80's and early 90's might have known Mario and Luigi as two plumbers from Brooklyn who got sucked into a pipe and ended up in the Mushroom Kingdom, but that was only invented by DIC for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuperMarioBrosSuperShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuperMarioBrosSuperShow">three</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3">animated</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperMarioWorld">series</a> based on the games. <em>Yoshi's Island</em> and its sequels imply that they've <em>always</em> lived in the Mushroom Kingdom. Other regions just avoid origin stories. Note that the Mario Bros. have never been seen in the Mushroom Kingdom between the time they were babies and the present. It can be pretty easy to put the pieces together and say that they were taken to Brooklyn to be protected, because, seriously, who in their right mind wouldn't move after all the stuff that happened to Baby Mario and Baby Luigi?
</li><li> The Brooklyn thing, in part, came from the fact that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong">Donkey Kong</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros">Mario Bros.</a></em> seemingly takes place in New York City. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>, <em>Donkey Kong</em> is now stated to take place in New <em>Donk</em> City, an NYC-like city that appears to be set in the same world as the Mushroom Kingdom.
</li></ul></li><li> Like his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomRivalry">rival Mario</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> has a fairly inconsistent past as well, though the video games themselves have never done much to elaborate on his past. Tails, Eggma..., er, "Dr. Robotnik" and especially Blaze have similar inconsistent pasts:
<ul><li> Sonic's origin is not concrete in the games. Sega of Japan originally created a backstory of Sonic coming to life after a human ace pilot, who had him as a mascot, died. This was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SonicTheHedgehog">used in the first manga</a> with slight alterations. Sega of America went with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogPromoComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogPromoComic">own backstory</a> about Sonic being an antisocial brown hedgehog who befriended a human scientist named Dr. Kintobor. An accident turned Sonic blue and turned the friendly doctor into Dr. Robotnik. This origin story was reused in the British <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em>. Later on, Sega of Japan changed Sonic's backstory to remove the mystical element. He's just a hedgehog who was born on Christmas Island and decided to leave because he wanted adventure. This hasn't been mentioned in over two decades, so Sonic largely has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">Mysterious Past</a>.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em>, Tails lived on West Side Island. That is where he met Sonic there. The manual to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TailsAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TailsAdventure">Tails Adventure</a></em>, however, says that Tails lived on Cocoa Island in the past.
</li><li> Eggman's backstory is muddled by retcons. In Japan he had no origin but internationally he received one where he was the benevolent Dr. Kintobor before an accident transformed him into the evil Dr. Robotnik. Why he lives on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals">World of Funny Animals</a> is not explained. This backstory was used in the prerelease promo comic and the British <em>Sonic the Comic</em>, but American adaptations ultimately used different backstories. <em>Sonic Adventure</em> introduced human NPCs, giving an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LionsAndTigersAndHumansOhMy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LionsAndTigersAndHumansOhMy">explanation</a> to Eggman being a human, and <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> gave him a motive for being villainous. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthDrift">Earth Drift</a> in the late 2000s/early 2010s retconned him again to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">Token Human</a> with no reason given to why he's the sole human around.

Charlie prevailed over the dictator but tragically [turned his back and got zapped/was blasted by a Shadaloo gunner/failed to escape the base before it blew up/suffered some mysterious terrible fate].

<ul><li> As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has given some canonical information regarding him.

<ul><li> Almost but not quite literally the case for Sakuya, who has knowledge and skills far beyond her physical age (late teens to twenties), is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Master</a>, and was seemingly recognized by Eirin, an immortal being who hadn't been to Earth in over 1000 years. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Perfect Memento in Strict Sense</a></em> mentions several rumors going around the human village, including her being a fallen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter">Vampire Hunter</a> or a Lunarian, but said book also says that they're all just rumors and more than likely none of them are actually true.
</li></ul></li><li> The premise for <em>Hail to the Chimp</em> is that former king, the Lion, resigned in disgrace due to a "scandal" that neither the box nor the instructions describe in any way. There are several possibilities as to what this scandal is, one of which is chosen at random each time you load the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, there are several contradicting stories about the past of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Legate Lanius</a>, from being a Legionary at the age of 12 to being press-ganged into joining the Legion. Even Joshua Graham, the former Legate states that he's never even heard of Lanius during his time in the Legion. In <em>Lonesome Road</em>, Ulysses, a former Legion spy, considers the idea that Lanius <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">wasn't always the same person</a> considering that no one has ever actually seen him without his mask.
<ul><li> <em>Lonesome Road</em> also fills in the backstory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">the Courier</a>, though only by choosing certain dialogue paths. There's an achievement for getting all six, and as a result is arguably this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Deacon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> will tell you multiple, often conflicting versions of his own backstory, including being one of the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Gen 3 Synths</a> liberated from the Institute, being one of the Founding members of the Railroad, and being it's real leader while it's apparent leader, Desdemona, is a puppet he installed to keep suspicion away from himself. If challenged on this, he'll freely admit that most of what he tells the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> is lies and that he's trying to groom them into embracing the "trust no one, don't believe everything you hear" attitude that's allowed him to survive so long as a Railroad spy. That being said, the version of his backstory that most players consider canon is the one he tells you when you reach <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">maximum affinity</a> with him - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was part of a gang of anti-synth extremists as a teen, but fell in love with a synth woman who the gang killed, and murdered the entire gang in retaliation.<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerBigot">He sees working with the Railroad and supporting synths as a way to atone for the evils in his past.</a></span>
</li><li> In the original game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor">Betrayal at Krondor</a></em>, Gorath was from the Green Heart, and moved his tribes to the Northlands during the Riftwar (Possibly making his tribe the one that Longbow tricked into fighting the Tsurani during the seige of Crydee). In the novelization, <em>Krondor: The Betrayal</em>, his tribe was originally based near Sarth, and moved to the Northlands over a century earlier when the Keshians colonized the region.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>:
<ul><li> About five versions of Cloud's past in Nibelheim have been officially released so far. At least one of these (the most detailed) is eventually revealed as a lie within the story, although due to the circumstances of the lie and due to it covering more than the others do, it's still debatable whether huge chunks of it are true or not.
</li><li> The other four are wildly divergent, with <em>Crisis Core</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>`s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">true</a>" account having roughly equal canoninity despite <em>Crisis Core</em> having an entirely new character provoke Sephiroth's downwards spiral and the fact that Zack doesn't get the opportunity to do all the silly things <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>'`s "lie" account implied he did.
</li><li> The OVA <em>Last Order</em> is also diverging, but probably the most radical in terms of what it implies about Cloud's past - it contains a strange scene where Cloud summons a great strength and his eyes begin glowing, causing Sephiroth to ask "What are you?", <em>long</em> before Cloud was granted Mako abilities in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, implying that Cloud isn't human or was experimented on previously. The events of <em>Last Order</em> have been explained that since most of the animated-special takes place from the Turks' point of view (the opening scene shows the report on the Nibelheim incident, which implies that the whole flashback is from what the official Shin-Ra history report says) its account is different from what was shown in the original game and <em>Crisis Core</em>.
</li><li> When asked about all this, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">has said</a> that there <em>is</em> no definitive version of the Nibelheim story because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">it's impossible to be objective about memories.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> This happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptunia">Hyperdimension Neptunia</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMk2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaMk2">Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2</a></em>, due to the two taking place in alternate continuities. In the original, Compa meets Neptune after she falls out of the sky, and IF is met (and unknowingly tricked) into joining Neptune and Compa's party a little later. In the sequel, Compa and IF were childhood friends, and they met Neptune (and Nepgear, who is exclusive to the sequel) after she fell off the top of a 10,000 story tower.
</li><li> When starting a game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiberalCrimeSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiberalCrimeSquad">Liberal Crime Squad</a></em>, the player may choose events in the squad founder's past, or let the events be randomly selected. These events inform their in-game attributes and skills.
</li><li> You get to do this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>. However, all it changes in game is your personal story for the first twenty levels.
</li><li> The Joker, unsurprisingly, has one of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamCity">Batman: Arkham City</a></em>. He's just finished telling his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> story to Hugo Stange (it's the mostly same one from <em>The Killing Joke</em>), and Strange points out just how many different stories the Joker has. The only common link is that he blames Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">in every one</a>. The Joker even cites this trope verbatim:
<div class="indent">"A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">wise man</a> once said, 'If you're going to have a past, make it multiple choice.'"
</div><ul><li> Notably, Strange accuses Joker of just using this trope as an excuse to never face up to his past and what he's become. Unlike the other rogues Strange interviews, he fails at getting under the Joker's skin.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> has Joker try to do the same thing to Doctor Young during one of his interview tapes. Specifically he goes from claiming he grew up in a fishing village with a father who wouldn't let him join the circus to his dad being a cop who was killed by the mob <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony">one week before retirement</a>, with Doctor Young not buying either story. Given the above comment by Strange in Arkham City, it would interesting to see how he fit Batman into those origins.

<ul><li> Psycho Mantis has multiple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuses</a> for his madness and sexually damaged behaviour. Calling Naomi on the Codec leads her to explain that he was once a sane and ordinary, if unusually powerful, police psychic who developed his madness after looking 'too far' into the mind of a serial killer and becoming infected with his mind. However, upon death, Mantis explains that he's obsessed with the concept of reproduction ("the selfish and atavistic desire to spread one's seed") due to his mother dying in childbirth, finding out his father hated him, and burning down his village in fear. Material released in Japan-only supplemental material explained that he naturally had a split personality which he refers to as "the parasite" or "the Mantis". What's more, production documents and concept art reveal that he was intended at first to have developed his psychic powers due to surgery and sexual torture (probably he was originally intended as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of the villain from the cult Japanese horror movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RubbersLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RubbersLover">Rubbers Lover</a></em>, who had this origin) - while nothing from this backstory is stated in game or any supplemental material, he still has heavy cranial surgery scars and a bondage aesthetic with no accompanying explanation. (Shinkawa's note on Mantis's character design sheet lists his main character traits and sarcastically notes, "it all came together!") A young version of Mantis later emerges as Tretij Rebenok in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em>, in which he's a child soldier who psychically feeds on the strong negative emotions of others - his nationality is also adjusted from Russian to Czech.
</li><li> In the original <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, "Naomi Hunter" is revealed to be an imposter, and to have taken on a fake identity based on a real doctor who went missing in the Middle East; her real name goes unknown. However, the character who informs us of this is Liquid Snake, and Naomi's brother knows her as "Naomi". Supplemental materials on the <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> disc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooseCanon">detail the past of the real Naomi and how the main Naomi was able to usurp her identity</a>.

It's effectively an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> version of these two tropes, even from the Nameless One's own perspective.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman">Rayman</a></em> has had several conflicting origins. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman1995">The original game</a> depicted him as an ordinary member of a species who all looked like him, only for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman2">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</a></em> to claim he wasn't native to the Glade of Dreams and was found by a fisherman (and he had no species). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaymanOrigins">Rayman Origins</a></em> claims he was created by the fairies to fight nightmares, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationVita">Play Station Vita</a> version (and oddly, <em>only</em> the Vita version) deepens the hole by showing him as originally being bald with a wife.

Additionally, he either went to "bending college," where he majored in bending and belonged to a robot fraternity, or had his knowledge programmed directly into him by a "bending school" on the assembly line that produced him (he's also mentioned attending high school).

</li><li> A running gag in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em> involves Manfredi and Johnson, two penguins that Skipper continually cites as examples of what could happen if someone doesn't follow his orders. Almost all of these wildly different stories imply their deaths, and the other penguins will corroborate them, so what actually happened is difficult to determine. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The fact that they are seen alive (but not well) in the finale only raises further questions.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Mr. Cat's life before coming to live in Smileyland, and why he went there. For example, in one episode he explains that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">raised by a salmon</a> after being tied in a sack and thrown in a river, but another one says he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunaway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunaway">ran away from home</a> because of his abusive family. Though all of the backstories he's given are sad enough to give him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>, and a reason for being as psychologically messed up as he is.
</li><li> Several of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMouse">Mighty Mouse</a> theatrical shorts involved giving him an origin of some sort, and these varied greatly.
</li><li> Xavier of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XavierRenegadeAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XavierRenegadeAngel">Xavier: Renegade Angel</a></em> tends to give conflicting accounts of various events of his life. One flashback ends with <em>his own death</em> and noting in the present day that it would've been tragic if any of that had happened.
</li><li> Actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> with Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">many</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">backstories</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>: they're occasionally shown to belong to a coherent, if crowded, timeline, most clearly laid out in the episode "This Is Your Backstory."

<ul><li> In various interviews, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YulBrynner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YulBrynner">Yul Brynner</a> gave several inconsistent accounts of his early life to make himself seem mysterious to the public.
</li><li> Over the years, comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveAllen">Dave Allen</a>'s act incorporated a huge number of different stories about how he came to lose part of his left index finger.
</li><li> Leon Redbone is notorious for giving various stories of his birthdate and his parentage, as well as claiming authorship of many songs which existed prior to his probable birth.
</li><li> Joe Kucan became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Kane</a> from a scratch off lotto ticket. He won a special election. He won a carnival game. He found the prize in a crackerjack box. He was in the right place, at the right time. He was the Dramatic Director on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">project with almost no funding</a>. Using employees was cheaper than hiring actors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf">Meat Loaf</a> often tells people how he got that name, only he never tells the same story twice.
</li><li> In <em>The Ragman's Son</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkDouglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkDouglas">Kirk Douglas</a> said that while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertMitchum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertMitchum">Robert Mitchum</a> loved to tell stories about his youth, the facts would be different every day.
</li><li> The origins of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">baseball</a> are subject to this trope, as it's hard to exactly pinpoint <strong>A.</strong> When/where the first game of baseball was played, <strong>B.</strong> Whether a sport referred to as "base ball" in early documents from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> was an early form of the current sport, or just a similarly-named but unrelated sport, or <strong>C.</strong> Which game counts as the first "official" game: any of the games played during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, the early game played at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a> (depending on whether this early version counts as a version of the modern game or just a precursor), or perhaps an unknown, unrecorded game. The game played at Cooperstown, supposedly organized by Abner Doubleday, is now considered fictitious, but it used to be considered a contender to be one of the great game's possible origins. Many historians view <em>all</em> of these early games as being partial examples of the game we know today, but that the game evolved a bit with each one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">Pinball</a> designer Kevin Kulek became this when it was discovered he was making pinball machines themed on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator">Predator</a></em> films without approval from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox">20th Century Fox</a>: Sometimes, he would say he misinterpreted the permission he received from Fox, and sometimes, he would say he never received permission at all.
</li><li> <em>Tullimonstrum</em> is so strange that palaeontologists cant agree on whether it was a vertebrate or an invertebrate. For over half a century, the creatures classification remains a mystery, despite countless theories put forth. Was it a proto-fish? Or a lamprey? Mollusc? Arthropod? Perhaps a conodont? Whatever <em>Tullimonstrum</em> was, its anatomy is so unusual that it will significantly expand the diversity of whatever taxon it is apart of.
<ul><li> On a similar note, <em>Nanotyrannus</em> is hands-down the most polarizing member of the <em>Tyrannosauridae</em> family of theropod dinosaurs thanks to a controversial debate amongst palaeontologists on whether its fossils represent a distinct <em>genus</em>, young <em>T-rexes</em>‭ ‬or even a dwarf species of another genus. However, significant recent evidence leans towards the three critical skeletal finds of <em>Nanotyrannus</em> being those of juvenile <em>T-rexes</em>‭.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitch">Twitch</a> streamer GrandPOOBear does this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> - whenever people ask him where his screen name comes from, he always comes up with a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8g28GCR-Qc">different, ludicrous story explaining its origins.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Answers include: it being a name passed down from generations, him coming from a circus family who wanted his act to be him fighting a bear despite being five years old, being called that by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodVoodoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodVoodoo">voodoo woman</a>, being a child actor who was called "bear" due to being cranky, but eventually softened and became "Poo Bear"...)
</li><li> The time between Ho Chi Minh's first stay in France and his education in France is this trope according to him. He claims several jobs such as working for a wealthy family in Brooklyn, working as a line manager for General Motors, and working as a Pastry Chef in England just to name a few.
</li><li> Like many Soviet era politicians, the biography of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is malleable, to say the least. Among the more absurd elements is Lukashenko's claim that his father died fighting in World War II, despite the fact Alexander Lukashenko was born in 1954.
