</p><p>In every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery">Locked Room Mystery</a>, the detective can't solve the crime just by examining the relevant evidence. They always need some external inspiration (apparently) completely unrelated to everything, something along the lines of:
</p><p></p><div class="indent"><strong>Sharona:</strong> Oh well, looks like you don't solve the crime. Whatever.

Often the character having the epiphany will tell the person whose offhand remark inspired it that they're "a genius" or the like; the remarker will then variously nod in a befuddled manner, ask "I'm what?", or simply demand an explanation. A character who wants clarification about what they just heard will often ask the other person to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatWhatYouJustSaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepeatWhatYouJustSaid">Repeat What You Just Said</a>.

(See below for details.)
</p><p>The Eureka Moment shows up a lot on diagnosis-mystery medical shows, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>, in which he does it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">nearly every episode</a>, and in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em>, which isn't even a medical detective show! It may also show up on telenovelas or soap operas with some ongoing secret that defines a character or even the main plot. The truth is often almost revealed several times, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyOverheardConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyOverheardConversation">easily overheard conversations</a> or weak evidences, and each time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">the status quo is kept</a> with some contrived explanation. When the Eureka Moment takes place, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> is not the result of a confession or an evidence that is too solid to be ignored, but instead the result of the hero putting all the small hints together and figuring out the truth by himself. In this case, expect a wave of several flashbacks of those hints before the "Eureka!".

While both can initially appear almost identical, a Eureka Moment leads to a coherent chain of reasoning that the detective can explain to the bystanders later; whereas a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatDeduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatDeduction">Bat Deduction</a>, if it gets explained at all, makes even <em>less</em> sense after the explanation. However, although logically sound, the Eureka Moment may be enough to convince the one who came to it, but not to convince others (specially a court of law). In this case, the character may began a quest to obtain a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokingGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokingGun">Smoking Gun</a> to prove things beyond any reasonable doubt.

<ul><li> A commercial for Shell gasoline shows a scientist trying to figure out how to explore for petroleum reserves underwater without building multiple derricks and drilling dozens of holes. While at a restaurant with his son, his son uses a bendy-straw upside down to suck up the last bits of milkshake at the very bottom of the glass, causing an epiphany. Cue the scientist making a pitch for a "bendy-drill" design.
</li><li> Breakstone's cottage cheese had two:
<ul><li> One has Paul Breakstone sitting in a bathtub while wondering how to make his cottage cheese more practical. Meanwhile, his wife is yelling at him that his bath time is over. Just before the commercial ends, his wife walks by and says "Get out of that tub!" He then gets the idea to package the cottage cheese in individual cups.
</li><li> Another has him sitting under a peach tree, wondering what he can put in his cheese so kids would eat it. "Maybe something sweet," he says, as peaches start to fall around him. Then he exclaims, "I've got it! <em>Pineapple</em>!" (He may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">Failed a Spot Check</a> there, but completed product has both peach and pineapple varieties.)
</li></ul></li><li> In an 80s commercial for Lucky Charms, Lucky was pondering what new marshmallow shape to add to his cereal, when an angry purple horse kicked him in the butt; he quickly thought of Purple Horseshoes. ("Eh, the idea just hit me!" he told the kids, while rubbing his behind.)

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> does this a lot. One time, he solved a murder he had been stuck on just by Ran mentioning that she had bought new pajamas for them. (To be more specific, she mentioned that said PJs were a matched pair, leading Conan to realize that the murderer was a set of identical twins.)
<ul><li> Conan is a brilliant detective hiding in the body of a small child, so if he figures something out before anyone else, it's not uncommon for him to subtly lead those around him to their own Eureka Moment, rather than raising suspicions about himself by voicing his deductions directly.
</li><li> There is also a certain part wherein Heiji and Conan figures out the dying message, but start, at Heiji's prompting, to subtly lead Kazuha to deciphering the dying message to make her feel better, as she was about to cry.
</li><li> As well as Conan deliberately inducing Eureka moments to Kogoro due to Kogoro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a> attitude after the murder of one of his old judo teammates.

Vicky will rub his nose for a bit, then inspiration for the resolution will strike.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, wherein two of her magical allies were cursed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterModeLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshifterModeLock">Shapeshifter Mode Lock</a> and could not effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a> as non-magical, she had no idea how to break the spell until she was given a dead crab as a gift. She was inspired by the crab's shell which protects it "just like a shield!" and deduced that she could use her Shield card to protect her allies from the curse's outside interference long enough for them to transform.
<ul><li> This was also how she first defeated the Watery card. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As she was at the aquarium with Yukito, she stares at his ice drink for a bit...then realizes that, since Watery <strong>is</strong> water, it can be stopped by <em>freezing</em> it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Utawarerumono" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Utawarerumono">Utawarerumono</a></em> (the visual novel), Hakuoro studies a strand of Mutikapa's fur in frustration, unable to explain why the creature fled the previous night when it had him and Eruruw in its grasp. Unable, that is, until Eruruw drenches him and the fur in tea and this trope ensues.
</li><li> Arguably the entire point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan">Yakitate!! Japan</a></em>, but applied to making bread. For example, one of these moments leads to the creation of Kazuma's "sushi-style" melon bread.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKaito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKaito">Magic Kaito</a></em>, another work by author Gosho Aoyama (author of the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>), Kaito figures out how an old, poor magician got a parliamentary pen after a kidnapper claiming to be the Kaitou Kid took the Prime Minister after Aoko tells him the key to beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">boss</a> of their video game is to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">king</a> controlling him first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>: Ash Ketchum has one of these in pretty much every Gym battle to turn it around (granted, his epiphanies don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRulesAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewRulesAsThePlotDemands">always</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">make</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">most</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim">sense</a>). If you see him panicking because his opponent is pulling some kind of unbeatable schtick, then snap his head up with a thousand-yard stare and say "wait, that's it!", chances are someone's about to get their ass beat.
<ul><li> Sometimes his companions do it too. May and Dawn get a few of these during their contest battles.
</li><li> Invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Cameron</a> by snapping his headband back if he's in a pinch during a Pokemon battle. It doesn't always work though.
</li></ul></li><li> Togusa gets two of these moments, early in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, and in both of them, he's in a bathroom, looking at the mirror. In the second, the mirror is crucial: He realizes that, from the batch of pictures he's examining, all of them show a mirror or other reflective surface, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the camera</span> isn't visible in any of them.
<ul><li> In fact, this is basically his main schtick. It's one of the reasons he's one of Section 9's most effective members; he's <em>really</em> good at putting the pieces together.
</li></ul></li><li> Occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>.

While taking a break while the investigation seems to be leading nowhere, Noah sees a dog barking at something they can't see &amp; mentions they can hear things humans can't, cluing Shinohara in to the fact that ultrasonic waves are the culprit.
<ul><li> Shinohara actually gets two of these in the film. The second comes when they learn that the evil genius who created the program had a plan to make all the robots in Tokyo to go crazy at once &amp; are trying to figure out what could cause enough ultrasonic waves to make it happen. When a whistling tea kettle causes a nearby figurine in a glass case to shake they realize it's sympathetic vibrations in skyscrapers caused by the wind.

</li><li> In "Courage of a Conviction", Erskine and Jim are sticking pins in a map to mark all the locations where a notorious forger has passed forged cheques. Jim comments that the only connection he can see is that they are all major cites. Erskine says that he is certain there is something they are missing. Jim replies "Well, you play your hunch and I'll play mine. That's what makes a horse race". At that Erskine suddenly realises that all the cities marked have major race tracks and, on checking the dates the bad cheques were passed, learns the cheques were all passed around the date of major horse races at those tracks, and deduces that the forger is a gambler who follows the big money horse races round the country.

Usually he's figured out the particularly far-fetched explanation very early (such as figuring out that a victim had been bitten by a T-Rex... don't ask), but the whole episode then revolves around him and Gus trying to find the evidence to prove the outlandish theory correct. Reverse Detective Work, maybe?
</li><li> Sam induces one in a doctor in the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em>. When the leapee's pregnant wife goes into early labor, Sam uses his medical training to recommend certain drugs to stop the labor. Unfortunately, these drugs do not exist in 1956, leading an air force physician to assume that he is pulling a stunt. Sam then remembers that the technique (developed in the 1960s) originally used alcohol; when he tells the increasingly irate doctor to think about what an intravenous solution of 5% alcohol and glucose would do, the doctor considers the implications and then realises that the idea is sound.

Until alien visitor Jonas Quinn notes that the Stargate is much bigger than the doors to the gate room, and asks how they got it in. (Turns out the ceiling opens.) This brings about the sudden realization that they don't have to shut down Anubis's weapon, they just have to get the Stargate off the planet and let it explode somewhere else.
<ul><li> Another one later in the same episode when, after O'Neill is unable to get the Stargate to a safe altitude with the X-302, he realizes that for these purposes the unstable hyperdrive is just as good as a fully functional one: it doesn't matter <em>where</em> the gate is sent, so long as it's <em>not here</em>. This hadn't even been considered as a backup plan; it just suddenly occurred to O'Neill when he ran out of fuel before reaching escape velocity.

LaForge is skeptical, but does it anyway. After awhile, Picard approaches them and it seems that they're coming up with the same conclusion Starfleet Academy was - no idea what was going to happen and things seem sketchy, but no concrete proof. LaForge <em>does</em> note that the plasma interlock on Wesley's shuttle was opened, which is extremely dangerous as it could ignite the warp drive plasma.

Spock utters "Chess..." and heads out. When McCoy finds him later, the doctor's incensed that Spock's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsNoTimeForKnitting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsNoTimeForKnitting">just playing a leisurely game of chess</a> while his best friend is in danger before Spock adds in that he just won four games in a row, an impossibility. After winning a fifth, he tells McCoy that he had been with Kirk the entire time everything had happened and that while a computer can be "flawless", something didn't add up. Winning five games in a row gave Spock the proof he needed that the computer, and thus the evidence, was tampered.
<ul><li> ...That could be thought of as a philosophical bookend paired with Kirk's Eureka Moment in "The Corbomite Maneuver," where Spock uses an analogy to chess as a way of signifying their lack of options, but then McCoy idly mentions bluffing, and Kirk suddenly realizes that an analogy to poker is much more suitable to their situation.

People would look for any excuse to disbelieve it. Murray gets his idea when he says that the vodka he's drinking is too strong and he needs to water it down a bit - they need to sell a 'watered-down' version of the story, where the lab is painted confessing to a far more believable crime.

<ul><li> One has Josh struggling with trying to determine a solution for an unfavorable rider to a long-fought-for bill that will result in a piece of land being used for strip-mining. After wracking his brains all episode without success, a chance comment from Donna about antiquated computer systems reminds him of a long conversation with the President earlier in the episode about national parks, and he comes up with the idea of using the Antiquities Act to have the President declare the region a national park.
</li><li> Another one concerned judicial nominees after the death of a Supreme Court Justice, and the declining health of the Chief Justice. Although all the characters were unhappy that they couldn't get the nominees they wanted confirmed, it wasn't until Donna told Josh the story of how her parents got their cats (they went to an animal shelter, and they couldn't decide between two, so they got both) that he has the idea of letting the Republicans name whoever they want for the open seat, if they will accept the Democratic nominee for Chief Justice.
</li><li> "Hartsfield's Landing" has one invoked by Bartlet upon Sam during the denouement of the overaching plot regarding the diplomatic crisis between the US and China over Taiwan. Taiwan intends to test-fire the US-built PATRIOT missile defense system while China responded by organizing a massive military exercise designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan, the end result is over 400,000 troops on high alert around the Taiwan Strait, not including the US 7th Fleet which was ordered to the Strait by Bartlet and a second fleet en route; all this is on top of the Chinese ambassador expressing displeasure at the US continuing to sell Taiwan advanced military weapons, including the prospect of the US selling four Aegis-equipped destroyers but which the Bartlet administration refuses to roll back for several reasons (Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the impending announcement of Taiwan holding its first free elections) and the threat of China test-firing their own missiles if Taiwan does. Eventually, word gets to Bartlet and Sam, who has been following all this from his office, that the issue was resolved diplomatically and that the fleets the US Navy sent were ordered to return. Sam elects to try to figure out how it was done with Bartlet watching: the deal was that China would stand down from the exercises and allow Taiwan to test-fire one PATRIOT missile, while the US agreed not to sell the Aegis destroyers to Taiwan for ten years (Sam had guessed five, but the gist was there). What Sam couldn't figure out was why Bartlet was seemingly willing to risk war with China when Eisenhower had balked at sending ships to resupply Quemoy and Matsu (island groups in the Strait controlled by Taiwan but less than a mile from the Mainland) back in the 1950's, plus the fact that each Aegis destroyer cost $800 million and four alone would eat half of Taiwan's defense budget <em>and</em> the fact that selling them to Taiwan risked China getting ahold of the advanced radar technology if Taiwan did get taken. Bartlet simply prods Sam to carry on the conclusion: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bartlet had never intended to actually sell Taiwan the destroyers, it had been a bluff designed to allow China to back down while saving face. The distinction between intention and what's actually happening had been hinted at earlier when Bartlet sees Sam make the mistake of assuming that "the US Navy is in the Strait" and "the US Navy is on its way to the Strait" are the same thing.</span>

<ul><li> The word "Eureka" originates from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">ancient Greek</a>, meaning "I have found it!" Archimedes was consulted to figure out how to tell whether a crown that the king had commissioned was made from the pure gold he had supplied to the jeweler, or whether the jeweler had substituted silver for gold to make a crown the same weight. But Archimedes couldn't damage the crown in any way to do so, and as the crown was such an odd shape, he was unable to math it out. When Archimedes took a bath, some of the bathwater overflowed the edge of the tub, prompting him to realize that an object displaces its equal volume in water. Jumping out of the water, Archimedes shouted "Eureka!" and ran to report this discovery to the king. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">Naked</a>. The subject of volume displacement in physics is, fittingly enough, known as "Archimedes' Law" because of this. (A Ted Talk presents an alternate theory that the project was building a massive ship, as "crown" and "keel" sound similar in Greek. <a class="urllink" href="http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-real-story-behind-archimedes-eureka-armand-d-angour">See the video.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)

It's been proven that people are more likely to reach an answer they can't think of by not thinking about it directly. Typically happens when you've forgotten something, when you're trying to think of an answer to some hard crossword, or something else mundane. If you're really struggling to think of it, then sitting back and thinking of other seemingly unrelated things has been shown to result in what you were looking for bubbling up.
<ul><li> Sometimes referred to as the "Toilet Moment" or the "Bed Eureka", due to this typically happening to people when they're on the toilet or trying to sleep.

</li><li> And the toilet and the bed aren't the only times when people are in this state of mind. There are others, like going to the fridge for a snack, and such is the inspiration for our very own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesOfLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/TropesOfLegend">trope titles</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> has a famous quotation where he points out that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">despite the example of Archimedes</a>, great scientific discoveries are usually not heralded by "Eureka!" but instead with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Huh. That's strange...</a>"
</li><li> Gauss once wrote in his diary "EYPHKA<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2dsbp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2dsbp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2dsbp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Those are actually the Greek letters epsilon-upsilon-rho-eta-kappa-alpha, transliterated as E-U-R-E-K-A</span>! num = Δ + Δ + Δ," thinking he'd proven Fermat's famously unproven polygonal number conjecture (yes, that's right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FermatsLastTheorem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FermatsLastTheorem">he did it more than once</a>) for n = 3; he later realized that the proof in his head needed significant ironing out, but for an open question, he got it quickly enough.
</li><li> According to Cognitive Psychology, when it comes to problem solving those "Eureka Moments" are actually called insights which are deep, useful understandings of the nature of a problem. However, compared to the typical slow approach to a problem solution, insights often occur abruptly and almost without warning. Tasks that involve insight usually require something new and non-obvious to be done and in most cases they are difficult enough to predict that the initial solution attempt will be unsuccessful. This can lead to the so called "AHA-experience" where the solution pops up all of a sudden.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MervGriffin">Merv Griffin</a> came up with the name of his popular quiz show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> after a network exec told him that the show, piloted under the name <em>What's the Question?</em>, needed "more jeopardies".
</li><li> A Eureka Moment is what inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> to write the entire <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> saga.
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Apollo13">Apollo 13</a> mission, NASA engineers needed to make the Command Module's air filters fit the incompatible slots of the Lunar Module. The solution was devised by a engineer while he was driving to work. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter">The film dramatization split this between an entire team of engineers</a>, but that doesn't make it any less awesome.
</li><li> In the late 90s, a few sitcom producers came up with pilots for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Fox">Fox</a>. The most promising one was about a group of teenagers growing up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>. But there was a problem: their choices for titles all had possible legal issues. After a test screening, one member of the survey group gave them their title by saying "I loved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a>."
</li><li> After people started writing apps which made phone screens bright white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">so they could be used as flashlights</a>, someone realized: "Wait, you know the camera flash? Why don't we just give it an on-switch?", and a much more practical flashlight app was born.
</li><li> Bob Gale got the idea for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> when he visited his parents and looked through his father's high school yearbook, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">learning his father had been the class president</a>. Remembering his own high school class president, who was somebody he didn't care for, Gale wondered if he would've been friends with his father had they gone to high school together.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoNagai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoNagai">Go Nagai</a> got the idea for creating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> after getting stuck in traffic one day and wishing for a way to get around.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> got his nickname this way. He was trying to come up with a nickname he could use to reflect an ice-cold stoic badass character, but kept proverbially hitting his head against the wall, unable to come up with anything. Just before he was about to give up, his wife made him some tea and told him "drink it before it gets stone cold." A moment later, both Austin and his wife looked at each other and realized what they'd just come up with.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> got started this way. According to the <em>Building a Cinematic Universe</em> documentary, when Marvel Studios was first created, one of the first meetings featured a discussion of which properties they still had the rights to. As they listed off the properties they couldn't use at the time (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Blade">Blade</a>...), they slowly realized they still had the rights to most of the various characters who formed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>.
