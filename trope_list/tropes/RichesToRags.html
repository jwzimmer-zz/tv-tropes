Keeping with the show's sarcastic tone, many of these people are still incredibly wealthy but consider falling into a slightly lower tax bracket to be the same as poverty.

When a thick envelope comes in, Morgan laughs that her father is saving time and just giving her cash. But when she opens it, she finds a mountain of bills and receipts inside. There's also a note from her dad saying he's sick and tired of Morgan spending without consequence and is cutting her off. Needless to say, Sabrina has to resort to some magical "humble pie" to get Morgan to realize she needs to get a job and actually take care of herself at last.

The harbor of Stavoren silted up shortly after in punishment for her greed, cutting off trade to the city, causing it to begin its descent into the minor village it is today and driving its lady to destitution, forcing her to live out her days begging for bread in the street.

The Feldhausens were one of the most powerful families in Bauhaus, to the point that they were on the cusp of forcing the Bernheims, Sagliellis, Richthausens, and Romanovs to recognise them as a fifth Elector House, something completely unprecedented in Bauhaus history. Then the old count died, and his twin sons Viktor and Otto immediately began fighting over who was the true heir. The internecine conflict dangerously drained the house's resources, and, to top it all off, Viktor refused to recognize his defeat and fall in line, but instead took the followers and resources he could muster and defected to Imperial. Where there once was a proud house capable of shaking the bedrock of power in the Solar System, there are now two minor and relatively unimportant noble families, at constant seething yet explosive loggerheads.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeTyson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeTyson">Mike Tyson</a> had earned over $300 million during his career as a boxer but had to file for bankruptcy, thanks to his colourful variety of debts including $13.4 million to the IRS and a $9 million divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Monica Turner. From 1995 to 1997, he spent $9 million in legal fees, $230,000 on pagers and cellphones, and $410,000 on a birthday party. In June 2002, he owed $8,100 to care for his tigers and $65,000 for limos.
</li><li> This also happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MCHammer">MC Hammer</a>. During the late-1980s and early-1990s, he was one of the most successful rappers on the planet (as well as being the first rapper to achieve mainstream popularity), but by the mid-1990s the public had grown bored of Hammer's upbeat, poppy rap style. Combined with the large amounts of money he was spending on friends and family, he eventually found himself $13 million in debt. In 1996 he declared bankruptcy. Since then he has unsuccessfully attempted a few times to revive his music career but has mainly been working as a Christian minister.
</li><li> Hip-hop producer Scott Storch was once worth $70 million, blowing his fortune on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">cocaine, celebrity girlfriends</a>, a mansion, a yacht, jewelry, and private jets. He allegedly spent $30 million in a six-month period alone. Soon afterwards, Storch went to rehab and was later charged for grand theft auto and failing to pay child support. Storch's mansion was later repossessed, and he filed for bankruptcy in June 2015, with only $3,600 in assets (cash, clothes, and a watch).
</li><li> This often happens to former nobility and royalty as the result of a revolution.
<ul><li> For example, the French royal family after they were imprisoned during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The Reign of Terror</a>. The Jacobins running the prison basically did everything they could to make them as uncomfortable as possible and humiliate them.
</li><li> After the Russian Revolution, this happened to Czar Nicholas Romanov and his family, as well as the entire aristocracy and capitalist class.
</li></ul></li><li> This often happens to people who win lotteries. Lotto winners often come from middle- or lower-class backgrounds and have no experience managing large amounts of money. As a result, many of them do not regulate their spending and end up broke (or worse, millions of dollars in debt) within a few years; if they're at least careful about their spending, there's still always the possibility of being hit repeatedly with lawsuits (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">usually meritless</a>, but taking even one to court can take giant bites out of even the most substantial of fortunes, making settlements the more viable option by a long shot; this, unfortunately, only serves to embolden parasitic people). Shady accountants are another thing that can bring them down; while they will eventually get caught when a discrepancy gets noticed somewhere, they can funnel <em>immense</em> amounts of money away over a long period of time and cause tons of other problems.
</li><li> An alarmingly high number of professional athletes, despite making millions during their careers, have found themselves broke less than ten years after retirement, be it due to alimony/child support, failed business ventures, shady accountants, or excessive lifestyles catching up to them, or the onset of medical conditions caused by the injuries sustained while they were still playing.
</li><li> British football team Leeds United endured this in the mid-2000s. After being Champions League semifinalists in 2001, they failed to make the next two tournaments, losing out to Liverpool and Newcastle respectively. After the second instance, the huge loans taken out to finance the transfer fees and player wages caught up with them. Their loans had been dependent on Champions League football <em>every</em> season. They were relegated in 2004 after going into administration. In 2007, they went into administration again and were relegated to the third tier of English football.

France could cut its losses of North American colonies in the Seven Years War and sustain itself on the sugar plantations of Haiti alone. It was run by a tiny class of white and mixed-race slave-owners who could lord it over the slaves on the sugarcane and coffee plantations. Then came two decades of near-constant war that ended with an independent Haiti and (at least nominally) free blacks - the first time in history a slave rebellion resulted in an independent Republic led by former slaves, but France imposed huge reparations on the newly independent nation, pushing it into economic problems it never fully escaped from.

Argentina is once again modestly wealthy, but nowhere near the position in the world it enjoyed during its heyday (to the point its economy has been overshadowed by neighbor Brazil, and also Mexico in a Latin American standpoint).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a> was once among the richest nations of the world with several Indian states having more gold than anyone imagined a single place could store. The likes of Marco Polo who came all the way to South India was agog at the wealth of the Tamil Kingdoms. Until the 1700s, India had a <em>monopoly</em> on the Diamond Trade, the crown jewels of every Crown in Europe came from the diamonds of Indian mines and Indian spices and textiles were highly prized and it maintained lucrative trade with Europe from the Roman Empire onwards. Two centuries of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">British colonialism</a> followed by post-independent malaise, Indians are far from being among the wealthiest nations in the world (though it is among the world's growing economic powers) and is famous around the world for massive poverty (as evidenced by the success of films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlumdogMillionaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SlumdogMillionaire">Slumdog Millionaire</a></em>), corruption and high mortality rates.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a> was legendary for its wealth and riches. Its porcelain products had long commanded envy and high demand by the Europeans who devoted a great deal of time and effort to copy and reverse engineer it. The Chinese government had a distinct policy of a tribute system whereby all who wanted to treat with the Emperor had to submit to be its vassal, a system followed by Dutch traders who came earlier. The English, having greater demand for Chinese products and wanting preferential treatment refused to play along, and responded negatively to the fact that the Chinese didn't think they had anything that interested them: China was among the richest countries in the world, it had a very efficient agricultural sector, a large population and produced goods like silk or tea that the whole world wanted. The only thing the Europeans could give in exchange was silver and gold. The British, or rather the East India Company, instead formed the world's first, and largest and most successful, drug cartel, by producing opium cheaply in India and thus reduce the trade deficit. China of course wanted to stop this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">several obvious reasons</a>, but when they did in the Opium Wars, it was the beginning of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingDefeatLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingDefeatLegacy">Shocking Defeat Legacy</a> of unequal treaties and colonization of coastal cities into spheres of influence, much looting and violence that saw the destruction of several villages, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage">Monumental Damage</a> and widespread looting that ended with China losing to Japan, ending with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">No More Emperors</a> and China seen as an ungovernable backwater nobody needed to care about, and giving the Chinese a strong desire to get back on top and turn the tables. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChinaTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChinaTakesOverTheWorld">This has turned around quite a bit</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">in the last half-century or so</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Japan">Japan</a>, too, for that matter.

Then they took on that rival power in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWar2">World War 2</a> and were nearly destroyed. Then came the post-war economic miracle, which saw Japan once again rise to such economic and industrial dominance that it seemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld">poised to become one of the major global powers, potentially eclipsing the United States' economic and industrial influence.</a> Then came the bursting of Japan's economic bubble, and the subsequent Lost Generation. Now, while Japan's economy has mostly recovered, it's nowhere near the level of the pre-1990s, and now faces new problems, chief among them a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan">severe population gap between the young and the elderly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that could have some serious ramifications for their economy and social infrastructure.

When the Revolutionary war came about, he took on a managerial role of the rebel army's resources, earning the unofficial title of "Financier of the Revolution". After the war, Morris, who was poised to become one of the wealthiest men in the world, engaged in aggressive land speculation, passing up on urban properties that would become central business districts to buy vast stretches of wilderness that would remain vast stretches of wilderness.

When he appeared as a guest on <em>Loose Women</em>, he thanked the producers for giving him a shirt to wear. His bandmate Jo O'Mera appeared on <em>Celebrity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> because she was in danger of having her house repossessed.
</li><li> Abz Love of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Five" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Five">Five</a> also appeared on <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em> because he was reduced to living with his aunt and later put his Brit Awards up on Ebay.
</li><li> Kerry Katona of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtomicKitten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AtomicKitten">Atomic Kitten</a> was declared bankrupt at the High Court in London in 2008 after failing to pay the final £82,000 of a £417,000 tax bill. After losing her Iceland contract, her magazine column, and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> shows, Katona suffered further financial setbacks. In December 2009, she received a repossession order on her £1.5 million home, having not paid her mortgage in months.
<ul><li> In 2013, she filed for bankruptcy at County Court in Wigan.
</li></ul></li><li> Shaun Ryder of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HappyMondays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HappyMondays">Happy Mondays</a> and Black Grape lost most of his money in the late nineties due to school fees, legal issues and other things.
<ul><li> His bandmate Bez was declared bankrupt twice in 2005 and 2008. He appeared as contestant on <em>Celebrity Big Brother</em> for this very reason.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BelaLugosi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BelaLugosi">Bela Lugosi</a> died, he was in such dire financial status that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> quietly paid for his funeral.
</li><li> When English comedian Freddie Starr died, he'd lost most of his money fighting legal actions in his final years, and he was reported as living in constrained financial circumstances in Spain in exile from creditors seeking financial recompense back in England. His family were without the funds needed to cover the costs of repatriating his body home for a funeral until an undertaker's firm from the city of Sheffield charitably paid for the repatriation and funeral service.
</li><li> Following Evel Knievel's conviction for assault in 1977, he lost most marketing endorsements and deals, including Harley-Davidson and Ideal Toys.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IsaacHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IsaacHayes">Isaac Hayes</a> experienced a decline in record sales in 1976. He and his wife were forced into bankruptcy in 1976, as they owed over $6 million. By the end of the bankruptcy proceedings in 1977, Hayes had lost his home, much of his personal property, and the rights to all future royalties earned from the music he had written, performed, and produced. He did manage to bounce back the next year.
</li><li> Comedian Rod Hull of Emu fame filed for bankruptcy in 1994 due to the cost of renovating his mansion and an unpaid tax bill.

Thanks to surgeries for all the injuries he sustained doing action films, he was no longer getting the plum roles, which contributed to his financial woes.
</li><li> British ski-jumper Michael Edwards aka Eddie the Eagle declared bankruptcy in 1992, claiming that a trust fund for his earnings was not set up properly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiftyCent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FiftyCent">50 Cent</a> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015 due to various legal issues.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes">Elizabeth Holmes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a rising star - a woman who dropped out of college to found a biotech firm that could analyze blood with a pinprick, becoming a billionaire at the age of 30. She graced the covers of <em>Fortune</em>, <em>Forbes</em> and even <em>Time</em>. She loved to wear black turtleneck sweaters as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to her mentor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SteveJobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SteveJobs">Steve Jobs</a>. She was valued at $4.5 billion. Then it all came crashing down in a series of lawsuits by government agencies, regulators, and insurance companies. Her worth was revised to "nothing" by Forbes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">As of October 2019, her lawyers are suing her</a> - in their words- "given Ms. Holmess current financial situation, Cooley has no expectation that Ms. Holmes will ever pay it for its services as her counsel.
</li><li> English glamour model and media personality Kaite Price aka Jordan filed for bankruptcy in 2019 due to various debts.
</li><li> Samuel Brannan, an American newspaper mogul and Gold Rush-era California's first millionaire, lost half of his money to divorce and drank away the other half. By the time he died, he managed to quit drinking and pay off all his debts but didn't have enough money to pay for his own funeral.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AbbottAndCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AbbottAndCostello">Abbott and Costello</a> got hit by the IRS demanding back taxes in the late fifties, forcing them to sell their homes and most of their assets, including the rights to most of their films.
</li><li> A tragic example was Francesca Hilton, the only child of Hilton Hotel chain founder Conrad Hilton and socialite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZsaZsaGabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZsaZsaGabor">Zsa Zsa Gabor</a>. As summarized <a class="urllink" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trialandheirs/2015/01/13/the-tragedy-of-francesca-hilton-daughter-of-zsa-zsa-gabor-and-hilton-founder/#45fd1da618b8">in a story about her<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after her death at 67, she "was raised attending celebrity parties, living in mansions, earning blue ribbons in horse-riding competitions, and jet-setting to Paris, Rome, and other fashionable cities." After her father's death in 1979, she was left with a relatively small inheritance, and bounced around in several entertainment careers that never took off. In her last eight years, she was flat broke and alternated between living in slummy apartments and out of her car.
