If another character tried, they would just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpontaneousHumanCombustion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpontaneousHumanCombustion">burst into flames and die</a>. You won't see your average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> using this.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> is rife with these.
<ul><li> A subset of the Shinobi arts are called the <em>Kinjutsu</em> — literally "forbidden techniques". For one reason or another, they cannot be taught or used by the commanding shinobi. Some fatally harm the user, like the Shadow Clone Jutsu, which creates perfect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doppelganger">Doppelgangers</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">take an equal portion of their user's chakra</a>, which is eventually fatal if too many are created at once and/or the sheer backlash the user suffers if too many are killed at once; a version of this is Naruto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a>, although Naruto has a superhuman chakra reserve <em>and</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Tailed Beast</a> that can handle it. Others are considered unethical, like the Edo Tensei, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiseFromYourGrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiseFromYourGrave">resurrects the dead</a> at the cost of another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>. Edo Tensei is particularly powerful (effectively giving you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUndead">The Undead</a>), which increases the temptation to use it, only for the user to find that at its most powerful, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">its creations might escape from the user's control</span>. Just using a <em>kinjutsu</em> is not a crime however (only the effect may be), and a few are taught in the course of the plot. So they are not so much "forbidden" but rather "regulated". For example, the Shadow Clone Jutsu can normally only be safely used by Jonin-level shinobi.
</li><li> Initially, Sasuke's Chidori is only supposed to be used twice at a time. The third time he used it, he would have died if he didn't have a cursed seal which nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">took him over</a>. Since then, he increased his own chakra capacity to the point that he can spam it without any ill effects.
</li><li> Kakashi had two forbidden techniques: Raikiri, an enhanced Chidori that requires a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye">Sharingan</a> to be used effectively; and Kamui, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">sucks anything he looks at into another dimension</a>. Both are limited by chakra capacity, and the second one deteriorates the eyesight of said eye. He figured out how to increase his chakra capacity (and taught Sasuke how as well).
</li><li> Naruto gets his Futon/Wind Style: Rasenshuriken, in the second half of the manga. It's so powerful that it causes widespread cellular damage to the arm he executes it with, including the chakra pathways. The damage is microscopic, so healing jutsu can't repair it, and Naruto's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> is so overworked that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">reduces his lifespan</a>. Tsunade tells him not to use it again. Then he masters his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Sage Mode</a> and perfects it to the point that he can throw it and nullify the risk to himself.
</li><li> Kurama is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super-Powered Evil Side</a>; at deeper levels, he also shortens his lifespan. Naruto winds up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">befriending him, which allows him access to his full power without having to physically transform.</span>
</li><li> Tsunade's regeneration jutsu <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">shortens her lifespan</a> as well, due to the Hayflick limit.
</li><li> Lady Chiyo's clan dabbles with using chakra "strings" to control life-size puppets (and in some cases, assist a human by adding their reflexes to the subject's). They began work on Kishou Tensei, a jutsu to truly breathe life into puppets, but stopped when they discovered it had a nasty side-effect of (you guessed it!) killing the user. It turned out Kishou Tensei could heal almost anything, including otherwise lethal injuries and even death. Unfortunately, to do so, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">it used the life energy of the user</a>, along with their chakra, so using it even in the normal way would be highly taxing for the body. And if they used it to revive someone who died, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">they would die in their stead.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chiyo winds up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">using it</a> to resurrect Gaara after his death due to Shukaku's removal.</span>
</li><li> Those with the Rinnegan can use a similar and jutsu to Kishou Tensei, but much more powerful, Gedō: Rinne Tensei/Outer Path: Rinne Rebirth. It is capable of resurrecting large groups of people at once, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">at the cost of the user's life.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagato used it to revive those he killed during his assault on Konohagakure, dying in the process.</span>
</li><li> Pain has been shown to have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SphereOfDestruction">incredibly</a></em> powerful version of his Shinra Tensei/Almighty Push that takes off years of his life, but can destroy an entire city in one blast. And he uses it on Konoha.</span> Nagato, on the other hand, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an Uzumaki, which means he has his clan's longevity</span>, so he can use it with reduced risk.
</li><li> The Shiki Fujin/ Reaper Death Seal summons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">a Shinigami</a>, who takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">both your soul</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">your opponent's</a> and forces them to fight forever in its stomach. The Uzumaki created a mask that allowed one to free the consumed souls, but it required its wearer to commit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">Seppuku</a> to do so.
</li><li> The Mangekyou Sharingan is an enhanced version of the Sharingan that grants all manner of nifty new powers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Tsukiyomi</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellfire">Amaterasu</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantArmor">Susanoo</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamui</span> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">Kotoamatsukami</a>, but each use of said techniques causes the user to slowly go blind (which eventually removes the ability to use said techniques entirely) and rapid and continued use accelerates the process. Sasuke only had his for a matter of <em>days</em> at most before his constant and reckless use almost blinded him literally. The only ways to avoid this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are to upgrade to the <em>Eternal</em> Mangekyou Sharingan, which requires obtaining a close relative's Mangekyou Sharingan to replace your own, as Madara and Sasuke did, or have Hashirama's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Senju cells</a> to regenerate the deterioration, which is what Obito relied on with his remaining eye.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Izanagi</span> allows users to cast genjutsu on <em>themselves</em> that can briefly override reality. As a tradeoff, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the eyes used to cast the genjutsu will be permanently blinded.</span> The only workaround to this seems to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">possessing the incredible regenerative properties of Hashirama's Senju cells, as Madara was only able to restore the sight of his sacrificed eye by incorporating said cells and awakening the Rinnegan. Also, combining Izanagi and Senju cells extended its duration up to a whole minute per eye</span>. Because of this, the Uchiha declared it a Kinjutsu, along with its counterpart,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Izanami, which trapped its target in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> until tey accepted the outcome they were trying to avoid. Even Edo Tensei-revived shinobi aren't immune to the blinding, as Itachi showed</span>
</li><li> The cells of Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage are both this and a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Deadly Upgrade</a>. They give those who are spliced with them a tremendous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, capable of regenerating missing limbs and otherwise irrepairable organs, like the eyes.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goku first learned the Kaio-Ken from Kaio-sama/King Kai, a technique that amplifies all of the user's abilities far beyond their natural limits (not just strength, but vision, taste, hearing, etc). On top of that, it can be stacked, applied multiple times to further multiply its effects up to 20 times. The downside is that it places severe strain on the body, risking severe injury or even death the more it's used. Kaio-sama/King Kai warns Goku to never do more than double it. Vegeta proved to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> where Goku used it at triple capacity, which hurt like hell, and then <em>quadruple</em> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a>. After that, Yajirobe made him scream in agony just by patting him on the back. By the time he fought Freeza, he was strong enough that he could use the lower levels without any strain, but Freeza was strong enough that he had to multiply it by <em>twenty</em> — the maximum. Not only was it not nearly enough to win, it also left him exhausted and defenseless.
</li><li> Thats not even mentioning the Super Kaio-Ken, which was seen only once during his filler arc battle again Paikuhan/Pikkon (though it is mentioned again in <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>). This technique is so dangerously impractical that it results in <em>instant</em> death if used while alive, and Goku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">can't even use it again</a>, even while dead. This anime-only usage was the last time it was used in Z, as the various Super Saiyan forms had superseded it in nearly every regard, and combining the two was only practical while dead.
</li><li> Tenshinhan's forbidden technique is the Kikoho/Tri-Beam, which will kill him with overuse or otherwise exhaust him to the point of being unable to fight. The attempt that killed him was an attempted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against Nappa that didn't work (mostly because Tien had also lost his right arm and a lot of blood, thus a lot of his strength) and the attempt that drained him to the point of exhaustion was using it over and over in the stronger Shin Kikoho/Neo Tri-Beam format to keep 2nd Form Cell from chasing after Android 18.
</li><li> The Mafūba/Evil Containment Wave is the technique Master Mutaito used to seal Great Demon King Piccolo. It requires so much ki that it kills the user, as it did to Master Mutaito; when Piccolo comes back, Roshi tries it unsuccesfully and dies as well. It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">age and the low amount of ki most humans have may have been a factor; Tenshinhan survived trying to use it, although it still left him completely defenseless.</span>
<ul><li> The Mafuba is brought back (like many old attacks and characters) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> in an attempt to seal an immortal god, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Future Zamasu</span>. None of the characters even mention the possibility of it being lethal and it in no way weakens the character who used it (except in the manga). It's likely that it was fatal for the Muten Roshi back during Dragon Ball either had too low Ki, he was too old and frail despite his expanded lifespan, or a combination of the two. It was more likely the former as, when the Muten Roshi is brought in for the Tournament of Power, he pulls it off three times in a row, then two more times later on before he decides to quit. Despite being over 20 years older, his ki had increased greatly, matching that of base form Goku.

It provides a <em>massive</em> boost to Goku's power, but has a scant 10% success rate and can potentially kill Goku instantly the other 90% of the time. The technique also leaves Goku weakened, in pain, and unable to effectively use his ki afterwards. Like with the original Kaio-Ken, this handicap is either dropped or overcome as Goku uses it more frequently in future arcs.

It grants the target eternal youth, but it costs the user his own life.
</li><li> The Alabasta arc introduces Hero Water (or Fatal Elixir), which massively increases all the drinker's physical abilities for five minutes before killing him.
</li><li> The Skypeia arc introduces the Impact Dial, which absorbs any force that strikes it and deals it back to the attacker, but also causes a great deal of pain to the wielder's arm. Its cousin, the Reject Dial, multiplies the counter-force by ten. Wiper, a character intent on killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of that arc with the Reject Dial, uses it three times and escapes alive despite massive damage.

<ul><li> Gear Second allows Luffy to use his legs as a pump to accelerate the blood flow around his body, dramatically increasing his strength and speed. It would kill a normal human, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Rubber Man</a> Luffy can handle it, although it does affect his lifespan. Luffy's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>, though, so that doesn't stop him that often.
</li><li> Gear Third is the next level up; he blows air into his bones, which enlarges his body and makes him that much stronger. However, after only a couple of attacks, the effect would wear out, the air would leave his body, and Luffy would now be Chibi-fied and vulnerable. He learned how to avoid that after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, which introduced...
</li><li> Gear Fourth, where he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">inflates his muscles rather than his bones and augments his whole body with Armament Haki.</span> This is much stronger than ever Gear Third, and he can even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">use it to fly.</span> But like Gear Third, it has a time limit, after which Luffy becomes vulnerable <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and cannot use Haki for ten minutes.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Chopper's Monster Point form comes from overuse of the Rumble Ball, which allows him to expand his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance">Multiform Balance</a> to seven forms rather than the standard three. The Rumble Ball's effect is already only three minutes, and he can have only one every six hours. If he uses two, he loses control of his transformations. If he uses three, he activates Monster Point, which turns him into an indiscriminate berserker who could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompbattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompbattle">curb stomp</a> either his enemies or his allies. It's also potentially fatal and knocks Chopper out of commission for a while, although he gets a better handle on it post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>.
<ul><li> To be more clear: post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, just eating <em>one</em> Rumble Ball triggers Monster Point, but Chopper stays in full control the entire time. However, the form automatically deactivates after three minutes, after which Chopper is unable to move for a long time.
</li></ul></li><li> Rob Lucci's Rokuogan (or Six King Gun) strikes his opponent with a shockwave comparable to that of a Reject Dial, but using it expends a ridiculous amount of energy. Overuse of the technique was enough to give Luffy a narrow window to defeat him.

<ul><li> Summoning the Celestial Spirit King is this. The Celestial Spirit King is the most powerful spirit a celestial mage can summon, so powerful in fact that just his appearance counts as an attack! To do so requires a ton of prerequisites, these include:
<ul><li> Having a very high magical energy threshold, usually sufficient to be able to summon and maintain <em>three</em> Celestial Spirits at once, a feat considered even by the spirits to be dangerous for most Celestial Wizards. After the summoning is done the user, if not outright killed by summoning the King due to magical exhaustion, will still be physically incapacitated due to the strain the summoning magic causes.
</li><li> The Celestial Spirit user has to sacrifice one of the Twelve Golden Keys to the Zodiac. These keys are super rare as only one key can be in existence on the planet at any time. While the keys <em>do</em> regenerate in time, there's no controlling where it might end up and since the contract is broken, it's up for grabs.
</li><li> The User has to have a strong emotional bond with whatever key they sacrifice. Otherwise the summoning will completely fail! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucy was in such an emotional state that right after summoning the king her response by one of the demons as to what she had done is to cry uncontrollably and not answer!</span>
</li><li> Even if the summoning IS successful the King is under a very strict time limit. Typically only about 10 to 15 minutes depending on the mage's magic power and his emotional state is directly tied to the mage's emotional state. So if the mage is incredibly upset or angry the king might very well go on a berserker rush against his opponent. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is exactly what the Celestial Spirit King does in response to Lucy being so upset.</span>

It got to the point where resident healer Recovery Girl put her foot down and refused to treat <em>any</em> One For All user because of their recklessness. Under "Full Cowl", he instead focuses that power through his entire body and draw out a certain percentage so he isn't wrecking his body. It's still this trope if he goes over a certain percentage, though.

<ul><li> A wizard's death curse. Put simply, the wizard, knowing they are about to die, draws up all their power and unleashes it in an extremely powerful spell, usually a curse on whoever was killing them. This leaves no energy to keep the brain or heart working, so the wizard dies immediately on casting.
</li><li> Hellfire, which is demonic power that enhances spells but only available when your soul is corrupted by a Fallen Angel. Soulfire, Hellfire's divine counterpart, uses the stuff that comprises your <em>soul</em> as the power source. Use too much Soulfire without giving yourself time to recover and your soul literally evaporates into your spells, killing you (and maybe then some). It's not so much forbidden as simply not available to most people have access to, however.
</li><li> Any sort of Black Magic qualifies for human wizards and practitioners, as every time you break one of the Seven Laws, you corrupt your own psyche enough that breaking them again seems easier and easier to justify. Prolonged usage can progressively turn even the best-intentioned Black Magic user into a gibbering psycho. Plus, the White Council is <em>very</em> likely to cut your head off if they find out what you've done - it's their experience that <em>not</em> turning into a mass-murdering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> after you perform one of these seven acts is rare enough to make getting out the ax before you can get started their first resort. The Council has one enforcer, known as the Blackstaff, whose namesake weapon insulates his mind from the effects and is thus free to perform any magic he sees fit in the line of duty.
</li><li> Casting spells inside a ring of fire, is forbidden for anyone affiliated with the White Council who is not a Warden. Doing so isn't considered black magic, but it amplifies the power of any spell cast to dangerous levels, as well as the effects of any mistakes made during the casting, making doing so extremely dangerous.

Also, there's an upgrade that can be applied to any hero or villain using the Hazard Trigger that increases your strength at the cost of dying if you <em>are</em> defeated in your new form. Major characters have been lost to both of these. Speaking of the Hazard Trigger, its "makes the user go insane" factor is no joke. It takes full control of Sento and drives him to kill with its <em>first use.</em> The other insanity-inducing power-ups, including this very series' Sclash Driver, are something that never drives the user as nuts as originally expected and is controllable in the end, but Hazard <em>will</em> turn you into a merciless killer and remains a weapon of last resort for a long time.

However, even most of the villains in the Enchanted Forest are too afraid to use it since activating it requires killing the person you love the most. Regina's desire for revenge on Snow White pushes her to the point of using the spell in the flashbacks of the first couple episodes. This is something of a variant because, rather than being dangerous for the user, it's dangerous for those around them; however, it may still count as Maleficent implies that the actions necessarily will result in permanent psychological damage.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Pro Wrestling </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A fair few wrestling moves involve both the opponent and/or the wrestler themselves landing on the ground, with the victim of a given move sometimes landing on their <em>head</em>; Suffice it to say that even accounting for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a>, wrestling is <em>extremely</em> dangerous.
<ul><li> Many regular folks (mostly kids) who haven't received proper training have tried out wrestling moves on each other and either seriously injured or killed the unlucky recipient, and as a result <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">the bigger companies have actively shunned "backyard wrestling" in all its forms.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Some moves can cause lasting damage to the performer's body. The two most glaring examples are the moonsault and the tombstone piledriver, both of which involve landing full force on the knees. The repeated stress of the latter move is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> switched finishers to the chokeslam and why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> developed the Last Ride.
<ul><li> Speaking of the piledriver, an actual piledriver (not the tombstone version that the Brothers of Destruction use - that variant is ironically a lot safer to perform and receive) is something that WWE superstars haven't been allowed to use for over a decade due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a> using the move on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, giving him the neck injury that would eventually end his career (no offense to Owen). Come 2013, the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> used it at all, let alone on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> (who's had a history of neck problems), upped the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HolyShitQuotient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HolyShitQuotient">"Holy Shit!" Quotient</a> of the match they were in. Said match is now considered one of the best TV matches in RAW history.
<ul><li> Speaking of the piledriver some more, there's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even more devastating variation of it</a> known as Kudo Driver, the Vertebreaker to you WWE fans, considered one of the most dangerous moves in all of wrestling. It's like a piledriver except, instead of holding your opponent upside-down in front of you by their torso, you hold them upside-down <em>behind</em> you by their <em>arms,</em> with the two of you back-to-back. This means their arms are restrained and there's no way to use your legs to cushion the impact. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler">Garbage Wrestler</a> promotion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FMW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FMW">FMW</a>'s second biggest star Megumi Kudo invented it, where it was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodSport">still</a></em> one of the tamer ways to end a match there. Unsurprisingly, WWE banned it in 2003, but it's still used by wrestlers in other, more reckless promotions, such as by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CheerleaderMelissa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CheerleaderMelissa">Mariposa</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground">Lucha Underground</a>.

Landing directly on your ass hundreds of times a year must be great for the spine and neck (yup, they're connected).
</li></ul></li><li> Most aerial techniques, but the 450 Splash and the Shooting Star Press are really bad; not only do they wear your body down over time, but messing up could seriously hurt you on the spot. Just ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a>'s Harlem Hangover (a top-rope flipping Guillotine Legdrop) combined the wear and tear of aerial moves and legdrops. Back problems caused him to abandon the move after only a few years of use.
</li></ul></li><li> The diving headbutt, and German Suplex (which puts a lot of pressure on the spine), especially nasty since they were both signature moves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a> and may have caused the brain damage that resulted in the deaths of himself and his family.
</li><li> Technical wrestlers generally avoid this as most submissions don't actually put that much pressure on the body. That said, WWE has discouraged many holds which involve the user bridging on their neck, often making mat segments less impressive than those of the other majors.
</li><li> Certain moves can get banned as part of a wrestling angle, usually by a heel authority figure.
<ul><li> banning the piledriver and its many derivatives is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenYearRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenYearRule">stock plot</a> in professional wrestling, especially in Memphis during the territorial era and Mexico City even after the territories fell. In fact the banning of the move is <em>why</em> there are so many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopHoleAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopHoleAbuse">derivatives of it</a>, though just as common is the heel simply sneaking the move behind the referee's back (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulOrndorff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulOrndorff">Paul Orndorff</a> was especially notorious for doing it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RickyMorton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RickyMorton">Ricky Morton</a> the most famous victim).
</li><li> At the 2007 Survivor Series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a> faced each other in a title match where Michaels would get disqualified if he used his finisher, the Sweet Chin Music. To even up the odds, however, Orton's championship would go to Michaels if he got himself intentionally disqualified or counted out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Orton won the match due to Michaels getting distracted trying to use the move but stopping himself, but then used it on him after the match was over.</span>
</li><li> In 2008, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero">Vickie Guerrero</a> banned The Undertaker's then-recently-added submission move Hell's Gate. Her reasoning was due to it causing superstars to get injured and cough up blood. She would strip Undertaker of his World Heavyweight Championship for creating it in the first place, and the ban wouldn't get lifted until over a year later by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong">Teddy Long</a>.
</li><li> In 2011, Vickie would strike once again, this time banning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a>'s spear briefly, and firing him for using it. One week later, Teddy Long once again lifted the ban and reinstated Edge.

The innovator of the move, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobashi">Kenta Kobashi</a>, has only used the move seven times in his entire career, and every single time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">it has put away the opponent for good</a>. This fact just added to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HolyShitQuotient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/HolyShitQuotient">"Holy Shit!" Quotient</a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWECruiserweightClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWECruiserweightClassic">WWE Cruiserweight Classic</a> where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LondonAndKendrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LondonAndKendrick">Brian Kendrick</a>, a veteran who was doing anything he could to stay in the tournament, used the move against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KotaIbushi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KotaIbushi">Kota Ibushi</a> in a last ditch effort to beat him. And even then, it wasn't enough to put Ibushi away.</span>
</li><li> On that note, the Ganso Bomb, essentially a marriage between a powerbomb and a piledriver wherein the opponent is dropped right on their own neck. It's about as dangerous as the Burning Hammer, perhaps even more so. For decades <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MitsuharuMisawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MitsuharuMisawa">Mitsuharu Misawa</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ToshiakiKawada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ToshiakiKawada">Toshiaki Kawada</a> were the only two wrestlers willing to do it and even then only did it once in an era where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan Pro Wrestling</a> was otherwise all about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">Serial Escalation</a>.
<ul><li> This is because the first Ganso Bomb was, in fact, an <em>accident</em>. Around eight minutes into Misawa and Kawada's January 1999 title match, Kawada delivered a spinning backfist to the back of Misawa's head with such force that he broke his right forearm and wrist. While Kawada <em>continued to wrestle for fifteen minutes</em> (he was booked to win the match, but he vacated the title the next night due to the injury), he was unable to lift Misawa all the way for a powerbomb, and the ganso bomb was an improvised solution.
</li></ul></li><li> The Styles Clash is fairly safe by pro wrestling standards. The "defender" has very little work to do and the "attacker" role is not very complex, which is amazing considering it originated from a botch of the much more dangerous powerbomb, which in almost every other situation require a lot of work on both sides to be safe. Ironically, The Styles Clash <em>is</em> a really dangerous move if taken improperly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/YoshiTatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/YoshiTatsu">Yoshi Tatsu</a> botched receiving it and ended up with a broken neck, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> has grown attentive and actually saved James Ellsworth from injury by noticing he tucked his chin<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11j2b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11j2b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11j2b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">tucking your chin forward is the normal way to protect yourself when receiving most moves, but as the Styles Clash is an <em>inverted</em> mat slam this is the <em>opposite</em> of what you're meant to do to protect your neck in this case</span> and landing on his hands.

The <em>barra vasca</em> is an immensely effective style, and a new world record was immediately made. The Finnish javelineers got enthused about this style and pushed it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by soaking their throwing hands in soapy water, inventing the "soap style" with which the javelin flew well over 95 m.

<ul><li> On floor excercise, all roll-out somersaults<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note255e1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note255e1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note255e1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">save for the simple dive roll, which is so easy it almost never appears in elite floor routines anyway</span> are banned. These skills were banned for women in the 1980s after Russian star gymnast Elena Mukhina was paralyzed attempting one such skill; the 2017 code of points also banned these skills for men.
</li><li> On women's uneven bars, all skills that involve standing on the bars, which were at one time relatively common, are now banned. Notable skills in this category include the Korbut Flip<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3fp1r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3fp1r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3fp1r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a backflip from standing on the high bar</span>, the Layout Backwards dismount<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note477it');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note477it" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note477it');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a backflip over the low bar from standing on the high bar</span>, and the Mukhina Salto<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note53tq1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note53tq1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note53tq1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a Korbut Flip with a full twist</span>. The reason for banning these skills appears to be partly for asthetic reasons <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6435s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6435s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6435s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">stepping up onto the bar often breaks the flow of a bar routine</span> and partly because of safety concerns.
</li><li> In 1988, Julissa Gomez was performing a Yurchenko vault (a vault with a round-off entry) when her foot missed the springboard, which pulled her body downwards so that instead of going over the vaulting horse, she crashed headfirst into it, breaking her neck and leaving her paralyzed (she would die a few years later of complications from the injury). Following her accident, the international gymnastics board ruled that a "safety collar" mat must be placed around the springboard for any vault with a roundoff entry to prevent exactly this potential mishap<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7navs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7navs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7navs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the safety collar doesn't give as good a rebound as the springboard, but it keeps the missed foot level with the springboard instead of creating the downward pull; the subsequent vault would probably be very low in flight, but it would get the gymnast over the table</span>. If a roundoff entry vault is performed without the safety collar, it's an automatic zero. An unusual example in that they didn't fully ban the skill, but rather banned a particularly unsafe way of doing it. (Other changes to the equipment were also introduced.)
</li><li> Also in women's gymnastics, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Produnova">Produnova<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, known as the vault of death, has a reputation for its high risk of injury. Unfortunately, because of its high value, some gymnasts will attempt it even if they know they can't get it around, which means they have a much smaller margin of error to avoid a catastrophic landing should something go wrong. Rather than ban the skill itself, the governing body decided to effectively ban the unsafe landing specifically — as of the 2017 Code of Points, if the gymnast "lands on the feet [and] any other body part simultaneously", she only gets credit for a <em>single</em> front tuck (almost two and a half points lower in difficulty) in addition to getting the execution deductions for a fall, which makes it not worth doing the skill at all. This way, a gymnast who can actually land the skill consistently will still be able to do it, but a gymnast who can't won't put themselves in danger trying to do it anyway.
<ul><li> Its Yurchenko equivalent, the Yurchenko double back (a roundoff entry onto the springboard, followed by two flips in the air before landing), is considered even <em>more</em> dangerous. While the "Prod" could very conceivably result in spinal injuries if missing enough rotation, the chance is lower than in the double back. There is as yet no official ban on the skill at the international level, but Marta Karolyi effectively banned the skill for USA gymnasts during her tenure as National Team coordinator: the first time she saw McKayla Maroney (widely considered the greatest vaulter in the history of the sport) attempt the skill at a national team training camp<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8m3yu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8m3yu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8m3yu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">almost certainly onto something much more forgiving than a regulation landing mat</span> Karolyi very firmly told her to "Never do that again!!" and then chided Maroney's coach for allowing it, because she was so afraid that Maroney could be catastrophically injured. That pretty much precluded anyone else from trying it, at least until Karolyi retired following the 2016 Olympics (much to Maroney's disappointment, since she wanted to be the first to compete it internationally on the women's side).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note98g62');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note98g62" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note98g62');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Apparently, however, the moratorium ended with Karolyi's retirement — in 2020, Simone Biles, the only gymnast in recent history who might match Maroney on vaulting, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/02/06/simone-biles-vault-video-yurchenko-double-pike/">posted a video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of herself training this skill into a foam pit, with a caption that suggested she might actually have an intention of competing it. In a <em>pike</em> position.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Figure Skating:
<ul><li> The Backflip is a well-known example of a banned element within the sport, being outlawed in 1976 shortly after Terry Kubicka became the first and only skater to legally land the trick in competition. The trick's notoriety is largely thanks to Surya Bonaly, who after dropping out of medal contention at the 1998 Olympics, performed a backflip and landed on one foot as a crowd-pleaser, penalty be damned. The Backflip overall is a bit of an unusual example of this trope, as it isn't especially dangerous and it remains a staple of exhibition shows to this day; most likely it was banned for being a highly atypical type of jump that also isn't exactly elegant to pull off in the middle of a routine.
</li><li> In Pair Skating, all lifts must be hand-to-hand, arm, body, or upper leg. This subsequently outlaws a range of dangerous lifts, such as those that involve the Lady balancing precariously on the Man's head, shoulders or back, as well as 'Headbangers' that involve swinging the Lady so that her head passes uncomfortably close to the ice. Like Backflips, these elements remain common sights at exhibition shows, but their risks keep them out of competitions.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> There exist two magic staffs in the game, the <em>staff of power</em> and the artifact <em>staff of the magi</em> which, while very powerful items in themselves, can be broken for a "retributive strike" which releases every spell inside the staff at once, centered on the caster. Given that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> is the norm, anyone attempting this strategy had better hope that the 50% chance of getting sent to another dimension comes up.
</li><li> There also exists an incredibly powerful dispel spell called <em>Mordenkainen's Disjunction</em>, which can destroy just about any magic effect, even those created by gods. If it is used for this purpose, however, the caster may permanently lose all his magic abilities and/or anger the effect's creator. And he is no slouch, believe us.
</li><li> <em>Complete Arcane</em> has a 9th-level wu jen spell called <em>Transcend Mortality</em>, which you're not supposed to use except in desperation. It basically makes the caster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> (and its casting is an immediate action, meaning it can be invoked right before an attack hits) and last for about one combat. However, once it expires, the caster instantly die and is disintegrated.
</li><li> This is the point of the corrupt spells in the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> (and their <em>Exalted Deeds</em> counterparts, sanctified spells). They are notably more powerful than other spells of their level — for instance, run-of-the-mill <em>Blindness</em> is a second-level spell, while <em>Seething Eyebane</em>, a corrupt first-level spell, causes the target's eyes to spew acid and explode — but there is always a tax, sometimes permanent, on one or more ability scores. The most powerful of these spells is harmful even to prepare and has a very good chance of rendering the caster dead and/or permanently insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">(if he wasn't already)</a>.
</li><li> Something else mentioned in the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Death Rock</a>. Artifacts are always dangerous, but this one is worse than most; its history does say that its owners tend to obtain great power and are able to conquer empires, but tend to lose the power at the worst possible time, and are usually overthrown in violent insurrections by their enemies. Here's how the Rock works: It gives the user incredible dark powers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">necromancy</a>, giving him the potential to raise vast undead armies. But it has a terrible cost; once a week, it demands the user slay his closest friend or loved one, and claim him or her as a zombie slave. If he is unwilling or unable to do so, the Rock and all powers associated with it vanish. Clearly, all former users never realize that if you are willing to do this, you're going to run out of friends and loved ones <em>very</em> quickly (a lot of them will likely stop being your friends before you can use them as the required sacrifices) and be unable to make any new ones; on the other hand, you'll probably make hated enemies <em>very</em> fast...
</li><li> Prior to the 2nd Edition, Orcus was murdered by Kiaransalee, the drow goddess of undeath, who usurped his realm in the Abyss. However, in the <em>Dead Gods</em> module, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a>, becoming an undead demon named Tenebrous, possessing a spell called the Last Word that was so lethal, even gods were afraid to use it. This didn't stop Orcus, however. Despite the fact that it was literally consuming him from within, he used it in his campaign to restore himself to life killing several gods using it in order to reclaim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">his Wand</a>, and regain his domain in the Abyss. (He succeeding in doing all that, but fortunately, failed in his ultimate goal: becoming a true god.) After gaining back his true form and position, he lost the ability to use it. (The gods have since taken steps to prevent anyone from using it again.)
</li><li> From 3.5 edition's <em>Tome of Battle: Book of Nine Swords</em>, the Shadow Sun Ninja <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> is a class of good-aligned warriors that accept the dark aspect within themselves and not reject it, allowing them to use the power of both sides. The final ability they learn, Balance of Light and Dark, lets their inner darkness run rampant, transforming themselves into a shadow form with a number of special immunities, causes negative energy spells used on them to heal instead of harm them, a bonus to Hide skill checks, and attacks made when in areas of darkness or shadowy illumination. It also grants the Shadow Sun Ninja the option to inflict <em>negative levels with no saves allowed</em> and heal a small amount of damage with every successful unarmed attack they make.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10geo9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10geo9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10geo9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Improved Unarmed Strike is a prerequisite feat for the Prestige Class</span> However, for every negative level the Shadow Sun Ninja inflicts this way, they also take a point of Constitution damage once their transformation ends. Low on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> at the end of the shadow form? A character can drop dead from the sudden HP reduction due to CON lost. But wait, it gets worse. Hit 0 CON? The character doesn't even return back to normal, instead dissipating into an inky dark cloud. That starts a 1 to 4-day random time limit to bring the Shadow Sun Ninja back to life, and only the spell <em>True Resurrection</em> will work. Run out of time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and then the Shadow Sun Ninja's body reforms as an NPC vampire, shifts immediately from whatever good alignment they were straight down to a champion of evil, has all of the Prestige Classes abilities, oh and they don't have the normal vampire's vulnerability to sunlight. Once this occurs, slaying the vampire still won't let the Shadow Sun Ninja be returned to life with any spell. The only way to save them at that point, is for their allies travel to the Iron City of Dis located in Hell and free their trapped soul being imprisoned there, which will instantly slay their vampire self if it still exists and restore them to life.</span>
</li><li> The Wish spell in 5e works like one of these; use it to cast any spell of 8th level or lower? No problem. Use it to cast a 9th level spell or to cause <em>any</em> intended effect that the user wishes (and the DM deems appropriate)? This is the tricky bit. After using Wish in the latter way, any spell you cast until a long rest will do an unavoidable d10 of necrotic damage, as well as reducing your Strength stat to 3 for 2d4 days. The real kicker comes with the 33% chance that the player who cast Wish will <em>never</em> be able to cast it ever again, throughout the fullness of that character's existence.
</li><li> Another 5e example: Evocation Wizards can "overcharge" their spells to maximize their effectiveness. Doing so once is harmless. Doing it again does a fair bit of damage, which increases drastically from that point on.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> setting, Wizards of High Sorcery view Primal/Wild Sorcery this way. It was three Sorcerers who, fighting an army of Dragons at the end of the Second Dragon War, caused magical storms that wracked Ansalon. These three Sorcerers ended up becoming the first Wizards after being taught High Sorcery by the gods of magic.
</li><li> Several of the noble families from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> supplement <em>Legacy of the Blood</em> possess the knowledge of a Dangerous Forbidden Technique or two, usually in the form of feats that only family members or their elite henchmen can select.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a></em> setting, Glantrians' use of the Radiance is considered this trope even by the Alphatians, who normally consider even the darkest sorts of magic to be permissible. This isn't because it's dangerous to the wielder (which it is), but because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> using the power of the Nucleus of the Spheres threatens to drain all magic from the world, bit by bit</span>.
</li><li> Overuse of what <em>should</em> have been a Dangerous Forbidden Technique - defiler magic, powered by the life force of creatures and the natural world - is what made Athas, the planet where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em> is set, into a desolate wasteland.
</li><li> In the Sorcerer game from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> line, there is one Path that can have this effect: Cursing, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>. Specifically, you can create an absolutely <em>vicious</em> curse rather than the normal version. The problem is, though, that it renders the caster a vegetable.

Unfortunately, doing so too often or with too much power runs a very real risk of turning you into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Unmada,</a> and if you keep pushing it even after becoming Unmada...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">It's a bad idea</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> features Goblin Contracts, magical powers that are cheaper to buy than standard Contracts and have nice effects (open all the locks on a building, see the future, drain an enemy of all their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Glamour</a>). The catch? Well, they also have side effects that will likely screw you over (respectively, your locks fail the first time someone tries to break in, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle">you go mad</a>, you lose all <em>your</em> Glamour).
<ul><li> One particular Goblin Contract is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">Call the Hunt</a>" which has no real catch because it is its own catch; it calls forth a hunting party of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">True Fae</a>. If the changeling who uses it doesn't run away fast enough, he or she will likely be killed or, even worse, dragged back to Arcadia to be tortured once again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent">Demon: The Descent</a></em> features a technique called "Going Loud". In simple terms this transforms your character into their demonic form, sets your magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel">Power Level</a> (called Primum) to 10 (out of a maximum of 10) completely refills your Mana (And having maxed Primum means you are able to hold LOTS of Mana) and allows you access to basically ALL of the magic spells in the game. The catch? Well, the whole point of this game is that Demons need to impersonate a human in order to avoid the attention of the games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. The human identity they adopt is called their "cover" (in the espionage sense of it being a cover identity). Going Loud irrecoverably destroys that cover, effectively erasing every detail of it from existence, which means that the Big Bad knows <em>exactly</em> where you are...
<ul><li> There are also Exploits, incredibly unsubtle delays of power that can do anything from resurrecting the dead to causing rains of fire to kill somebody so hard, it erases their last action from existence. Every one of them requires a Compromise roll, which may not <em>destroy</em> the Cover, but can certainly damage it.

Once per session, the player may declare that the Queen of Storms is manifesting power through their character. This lets her use any Tempesta or unaligned Charm with a rating of half the character's Tempesta or less, with as many successes as the player wants and none of the normal costs. The catch? The character also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">takes Resistant Lethal damage equal to the number of successes chosen</a>, and the book specifically states that the Queen of Storms has killed her own soldiers in this way.
</li><li> Plenty of Charms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> come with heavy tolls. The more common include pushing up your Limit track, and Abyssals have some that increase resonance or mean that they'll experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">Cessation of Existence</a> upon death.
<ul><li> The Infernal Exalted get a good number of these, mainly because they're learning Charms that make them more like their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Yozi</a> patrons. Learn a Charm that gives you increased authority over lesser demons? That means greater demons are allowed to walk all over you. Learn a Charm that perfectly blocks Social attacks? That's because it turns all noise into wretched discord that makes you want to kill. Learn a Charm that allows you to communicate telepathically? Shame you can now only vocalize laughter for the rest of your days.

However, while the cost to activate it is rather modest game-wise, there are some major prices to be paid: first, you suffer the strongest Fatebinding upon activation, second, if you die, all the Avatars you learned to channel get loose all at once, and third, you activate it in the domain of a Titan, you'll attract every Titan Avatar in it, and chances are, they'll already have their own powers ready as well. Congrats, you now get to fight five or six beings with the same power as you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has a bunch of cards that are effectively this. You can't miss them, because they all inform you that <em>you lose the game</em> after a certain amount of time or if a certain condition is met. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower">Final Fortune</a> allows the user a free turn at a cost and color that doesn't normally get it, but the user loses the game at the end of that turn if they haven't won yet. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">Lich and its variants</a> protect you from dying through life loss, but kill you under other circumstances, such as an empty graveyard.
</li><li> For Black, there is no technique dangerous or forbidden enough <em>not</em> to use. In story terms, it is the color that regularly makes use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancy">death magic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">bargains with demonic beings for power</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">paying the price for that power without a second thought</a>; Mechanically, many cards require either a payment of life points or the sacrifice of a creature upfront as payment, or repeated payments over time for upkeep. The logical extreme of this mentality is the "Suicide Black" deck, an aggressive deck that uses cards like <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397570">Carnophage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which are powerful for their mana cost but possess drawbacks that <em>will</em> kill you if you don't win quickly. It's referred to as "tearing your arm off and beating your opponents to death with it before you bleed out".
</li><li> The best definition of this trope is the card Demonic Pact. Each turn, you <em>must</em> apply one of its effects, but you can't use the same one twice. These effects are draining a sizable chunk of someone's life, making an opponent discard 2 cards, draw 2 cards yourself and <em>losing the game</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlueRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlueRose">Blue Rose</a></em> has Sorcery, generally banned in most kingdoms, to the point that legalizing the <em>study</em> of sorcery in Aldis has been greatly controversial. While arcana are generally legal in Aldis, sorcery allows an adept to directly harm, control or invade other individuals, mentally or physically, as well as create undead or summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">darkfiends</a>, and are considered crimes against all sentient beings. Trying to classify sorcery is tricky, as few arcana are clearly sorcery, and even those that are can be wielded for a period of time without any real damage to the adept if he is sufficiently resilient. Unfortunately, sooner or later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">The Corruption</a> takes hold, and the adept will either fall into the arms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">Shadow</a>, die a painful death and become transformed into a walking corpse, or try to cleanse himself even as corruption makes it harder. Many people who use sorcery are scrupulous enough to embrace the corruption that comes with it, but the temptation is always there for any arcanist, even those with the best intentions.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> card game has a few perfectly legal cards that could be considered this. One is <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Destructive_Draw">Destructive Draw<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's a Continuous Trap that lets you draw twice during your Draw Phase if you have no cards in your hand when you start your turn. <em>However</em>, you take 700 points of damage per turn, and unlike most cards like this, it's possible to lose the duel this way. Also, this card is hard to get rid of; doing so causes the player who uses it 3,000 points of damage.
<ul><li> At least there are ways to turn that one to your advantage, like Prime Material Dragon. And the even worse card is <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Lucky_Punch">Lucky Punch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is also a Continuous Trap, and it lets you toss three coins once per turn when your opponent attacks. Get three heads, and you get to draw three times. (That's only a 12.5% chance, by the way.) Here's the catch: If you get three tails, the card is destroyed, and if it's destroyed in ANY way, you lose 6,000 Life Points. (Because it isn't considered damage or a Life Point payment, there's really no way to avoid it or convert it to Life Point gain.)

You only harness a Warp Charge on a roll of a 4+, which means that, on average, you'll need to roll two dice for every 1 Warp Charge requirement, and probably significantly more if you MUST have it go off. This means that you will need about 6-9 dice to reliably use a 3 Warp Charge Power. Given that the average army's psykers can maybe get 10 dice to use in total (and that's if you're lucky) this is a significant investment of resources. You also have to declare all the dice you want to use for the attempt before rolling them; if you choose 7 but five came up a dud, the remaining two are wasted. On top of that, if any harnessing attempts result in 2 or more 6's, the Psyker perils and has a chance to be devoured by Daemons (which can result from such pleasantries as being flat out removed as casualty to simply forgetting the spell then taking a punch to the nuts). Worse if you decide for him to roll on one of the Daemonology Disciplines without being the proper faction (Grey Knights for Sanct, Daemons for Malefic); this table perils on any sets of doubles, not just two 6's.

The overuse of both schools of magic during the War of the Magi led to the Sixth Umbral Calamity, seriously draining the planet of its aether in the process. As such, both White and Black Magic are considered forbidden arts under Eorzean law, with very few exceptions ever allowed. The Padjal of the Black Shroud can safely use White Magic, since they are keyed into the elementals, and any who practice White Magic without their blessing is considered an outlaw. Black Magic, meanwhile, is outright banned because those who practice it often cause widespread death in their wake, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> being given a pass because they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">the Warrior of Light</a>.

</li><li> In gameplay, there is the invincibility abilities used by the Dark Knight and Gunbreaker tank jobs, "Living Dead" and "Superbolide" (respectively). "Living Dead" allows a Dark Knight to survive otherwise fatal damage with just 1 HP while granting them invulnerability, but if their HP is not completely recovered within ten seconds of entering this "Walking Dead" state, they will die automatically.

The rune itself is sentient and tries to engineer events around it to guarantee it will keep getting used, until eventually its bearer is killed and the rune jumps to a new host, only to begin the cycle anew. Interestingly, the Rune of Punishment governs atonement and forgiveness. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> if the player is able to forgive the resident backstabbing friend Snowe throughout the course of the game (and he becomes less and less worthy of forgiveness as time goes on, so it's tough) and recruit all 108 Stars of Destiny, Leknaat appears and says that the rune's time of punishment is at an end, and the time for forgiveness has arrived. In addition to unlocking the most powerful rune attack, which greatly damages enemies and greatly heals allies, the improved Rune of Punishment no longer injuries the user for attacks.</span> This, of course, implies that everyone that used the rune before was either a) stupid and greedy, or b) unable to understand the proper implications of forgiveness.

When the whip's power is unlocked in game, it can be used as much as you want with no negative consequences gameplay-wise, but it's likely that it would simply take longer than the few days the game seems to take place over for it to take a serious toll.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaOrderOfEcclesia">Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia</a></em> has the Dominus glyphs; Dominus Anger and Dominus Hatred are direct attack glyphs that are incredibly powerful but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">take off a solid chunk of your HP</a>, while Dominus Agony massively increases all your stats at the cost of constant damage over time.

The main character, Ryu, can transform into a ridiculously powerful dragon form at any time which can even floor bosses in a few attacks. However, there's a % counter in the top-right corner of the screen that's slowly ticking towards 100% throughout the game, and using dragon powers make the counter increase much more quickly than it normally does - and if the counter gets to 100%, it's game over. Without dragon powers, the boss fights are quite hard (especially the later ones), so it's down to the player to manage how often they use the dragon powers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VagrantStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VagrantStory">Vagrant Story</a></em> has learned techniques that, when used, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">drain a portion of your health</a>.
</li><li> Akuma's (Gouki in the original Japanese) fighting-style from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> has the Shun Goku Satsu attack. Until it was mastered by Akuma, it was generally assumed that using it would always be lethal to both. Of course, in-game, it's just a move that does a lot of damage...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>: There is an unlockable weapon for the Demoman class called The Eyelander, a massive sword which decapitates and heals its user on a killing blow. The downside is that having the sword in your loadout reduces your max HP by 25 because the blade <em>feeds on your soul</em>.
<ul><li> Averted when, upon killing enough people with the eyelander, the Demoman becomes second in max health only to the Heavy and in speed to the Scout (or a Soldier with the Escape Plan at maximum effect).
</li><li> A more appropriate example is the Equalizer. It's possible for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Soldier</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">do huge damage</a> when wielding the melee weapon and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitpointWonder">at low health</a>. Obviously while powerful, using the weapon this way is very risky, as a casual shot could kill the soldier. Oftentimes cornered soldiers with no rockets use this tactic as a last resort.
</li><li> Similarly, the Escape Plan increases the Soldier's speed when wielded as the user's health decreases, allowing the wielder to catch up to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Scout</a> when at less than 20% HP. It also applies a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageIncreasingDebuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageIncreasingDebuff">Damage-Increasing Debuff</a> to the user when wielded that persists for a few seconds after being wielded.
</li><li> A sillier example is the close combat Ullapool Caber. Is it a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caber_toss">giant log<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that takes health of the user when you swing it? No. It's a stick grenade, that you whack people with. It only works once, and you sure as hell are going to feel it if you don't have any bonuses because it explodes in your face. Despite the fact that you are dead if you come across another enemy, it's quite deadly, and can be useful as a last resort or for <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OHKOs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OHKOs">OHK Os</a> with a critical charge.
</li><li> The Boston Basher for the scout is possibly his most powerful DPS weapon, having no damage penalty or crit penalty while being able to inflict bleed damage. However, any attacks that make absolutely no contact will instead hit you, inflicting full damage and bleed on you. On a crit, this can kill the wielder in one hit (although not instantly, but the bleed will do him in if he doesn't find a medkit). If combined with the Crit-a-Cola, this can turn the user into a whirlwind of pain, so long as they never miss.
</li><li> The Conniver's Kunai was designed with this in mind; it lowered the user's health so low that a glancing hit from any weapon was strong enough to kill the wielder. This is especially problematic because the class that uses it, the spy, is often in the midst of combat and very likely to get glanced even if the opponent doesn't know he exists. The perk comes that upon a successful backstab, the user gains all the health of the person he just killed. Skilled Kunai users can chainstab through an absurdly large amount of people that they can effectively tank sentries while this happens, which also helps that they also wipe out entire teams with this kind of a maneuver.
</li></ul></li><li> The first four <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack//</a></em> games feature Data Drain, a technique that allows the user to either severely weaken a computer-controlled enemy, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> a human being (most humans hit with a Data Drain end up in comas). The hero, Kite, is the only human with the ability. He uses it to weaken game enemies that have been hacked so as to have infinite HP, thereby making them easy to defeat and to gather virus data to hack into protected areas of the game. The catch is that repeated use will corrupt his character data with the virus, causing nasty side effects in battle and, eventually, his character's death.
</li><li> Multiple moves in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> franchise harm the user (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Explosion</a>), but these moves also tend to be very powerful.
<ul><li> And then there's the move "Struggle," which is a rather weak move that damages the user by 1/4th of its max HP. Chances are, you're only using it four times before you die. And that's a base case scenario; considering that it's a move that only becomes available when all your other moves are out of PP, odds are it'll do even less than that.
</li><li> Focus Punch is extremely powerful but at two costs. 1. It takes one turn to power up, leaving it open for attack. 2. If your pokemon is hit while powering up it "loses focus" and can't attack.
</li><li> And, of course, the classic Hyper Beam and all of its variations. It has 150 base power but also renders the user immobile on the next turn.
</li><li> There's also Curse and Belly Drum, where the user sacrifices half its total HP in order to have the foe lose 1/4 HP every turn or maximize its Attack, respectively. If the user uses the former when they have less than half HP left, they faint; the latter fails when the user is at half HP or less.
</li><li> As of Generation V, there's a move called Final Gambit, which causes the user to deal its current HP to the enemy at the cost of fainting. It's also commonly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">suggested</a> as the best move for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">Shedinja</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">And then</a> there's moves like Overheat and Close Combat, which, while powerful cause Stat drops to the user and leave them vulnerable to opposing attacks.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em>, one can choose to break a magic wand in half, unleashing all the remaining power at once. Can be dangerous as most wands will simply explode.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>, Valkyrur are already so powerful that not only can they fire huge lasers, NORMAL BULLETS HAVE NO EFFECT ON THEM AND MORTAR ROUNDS CAN ONLY STUN THEM. However, they can sacrifice their life to do things on the scale of annihilating a fort, and the army inside it in a giant blue flame.

While in theory, it's no more dangerous than regular magic, the potential for sacrificing or controlling others is considered too dangerous by almost everyone. Even the Tevinter Imperium officially condemns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a>, though in practice all of the Magisters are secretly Blood Mages. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Grey Wardens</a> don't officially forbid it, but many are still leery of it.

This is meant to communicate to the player that they should only use it as a last resort, as doing so will negatively impact their score. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Good luck figuring that out without trial and error, though.</a> Although the only time that the Healing Touch is actually bad is in <em>Under the Knife</em>, where it slaughters your ranking.

Saturos even warns Felix in the first game that he and Menardi won't be much help after fighting Isaac &amp; Co. as the Fusion Dragon (which they aren't, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">not for the reasons Saturos had expected</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">forced</a> on the antagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunTheLostAge">Golden Sun: The Lost Age</a></em>, they are left without enough power to warm themselves against the freezing cold of the Northern Reaches, and freeze to death.

But there are many with heavy, even potentially crippling costs.
<ul><li> Ipecac changes one's tears into a strong explosive attack, at the cost of making them charge slowly and be able to hurt the player. In an added bit of irony, range up effects or upgrades actually make Ipecac harder to use, as maxed range makes the projectile detonate far from the player. This means they'd need to hug the opposite wall just to have a hope of hitting a target in the middle of the room.
</li><li> The Suicide Bomber vest allows the player to use unlimited explosions, with the downside being they also take the damage. Because, you know, they are detonating bombs strapped to their chest.
</li><li> The Devil Rooms usually hold a number of power items, and while they vary from room to room they're relatively consistent. The problem comes from having to sacrifice heart containers to receive them. Not hearts, heart CONTAINERS. The player literally sacrifices their life for power. And that's not counting many of the items they get from the devil rooms have their own disadvantages.

In gameplay terms, it vastly increases his attack speed and power, at the cost of rapidly eating away as his POW meter (which, if depleted, causes him to become exhausted and unable to move or attack until it refills completely.)

<ul><li> There's also the Darkova spell, which transforms the user into a massive, powerful Cerberus.

It is said that their original homeland of Yokuda was destroyed by this technique, so it became forbidden and was lost to history. (Though the "destruction of the homeland" story is hinted at being an embellishment, and the Redguard people left Yokuda to escape much more traditional violence and oppression.) This being <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, where lore is often intentionally contradictory, it is left up to the audience to draw their own conclusions.
<ul><li> The Bosmer have a much more well-documented technique known as the Wild Hunt where they call upon the power of their patron god to turn into horrifying, berserk creatures that kill and consume everything in their path. However, the transformation is permanent, and changed Bosmer are so consumed by their hunger that they will literally eat <em>each other</em> if no prey is readily within reach, meaning that Wild Hunts usually end with a "cannabalistic orgy" (as described by one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> writer) once the affected Bosmer kill and consume every other animal or person they can find.

Some examples are Huskar's <em>Life Break</em>, an ability that will deal 35% of an enemy's current HP as damage, but will do the same thing to Huskar himself, and the Techies <em>Suicide Squad, Attack!</em>, which will kill the Techies with a massive explosion, but will also deal massive damage to any enemies in the explosion's radius, if not kill them outright.

However, in the Deepest Dark mod, this attack gains incredibly high offensive bonuses against every status effect on the target. The catch is that if there are no status effects on the target it's not much better than a normal attack and using this move at all stuns, debuffs, and marks the user for 3 turns, ensuring anything that survives will focus their attacks on him and kill him before he recovers.

However, even the boss cannot control the full spell and has to split it into three components which it channels through orbiting altar-like enemies. To defeat the boss, Boki has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">copy all three component powers</a> and then combine them to unleash the spell's full power. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox">The result is not pretty</a>, though fortunately this all happens in a simulation, so the worst that happens is the sim crashes and Boki gets knocked out.

Gouken hated this aspect of his fighting style and created a fork that does away with it in order to promote humanity and personal growth through martial arts. Despite that, Ryu constantly struggles to avoid succumbing (the endgame being the "what if" character Evil Ryu) and Gouken's brother Akuma has embraced it, despising Gouken for teaching a "softened" art (though he is not entirely in control of it, as Oni demonstrates can happen if he relies on it too much). Techniques that draw upon the <em>Satsui no Hadou</em> are themselves Dangerous Forbidden Techniques; being the Metsu Hadoken, Metsu Shoryuken, and Shun Goku Satsu (the last one potentially being lethal to both the victim and user, depending on the contents of the user's soul).

<ul><li> Backfired with the destruction of HMS <em>Invincible</em> at Jutland. The Dangerous Forbidden Technique, in this case, was the bypassing of safety protocols designed to prevent flashdown of a detonation in a turret from reaching the magazines, and it was done to increase the rate of fire. But <em>Invincible</em> was pounding the crap out of the German SMS <em>Lutzow</em>, so why not? Why not, indeed. The mist that was hiding her cleared, just long enough for the critically damaged but afloat <em>Lutzow</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11q6ou');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11q6ou" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11q6ou');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At the end of the battle, <em>Lutzow</em> was too badly damaged to withdraw and was scuttled.</span>, along with a second German battlecruiser SMS <em>Derfflinger</em>, to get some solid hits in the right place, and <em>Invincible</em> was blown in two. At least one and possibly both of the other British battlecruisers lost that day went up for the same reason. The fact that British ships of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> used more volatile gunpowder than their German counterparts didn't help, either.
<ul><li> Similarly, many tanks have manually- or power-operated doors separating the ammunition locker from the turret, to keep a strike that penetrates the locker, or an onboard fire, from cooking off shells and killing the crew. Sometimes these doors will be disabled or removed to increase the rate of fire, but it's obviously not an approved practice.
</li></ul></li><li> Another naval example would be the Japanese mounting the infamous "Long-Lance" torpedo on their cruisers. The torpedoes were stealthier than most, but also much more volatile. Thus, if they were hit while still on the ship the resulting explosion often crippled the ship. This happened to the cruiser <em>Chokai</em> during the Battle of Samar, which was fired on by the single 5" gun of the escort carrier USS <em>White Plains</em>. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeWeapon">usually incapable of penetrating a cruiser's armor</a>, one hit set off eight torpedoes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">each with a 1000-pound warhead and a tank full of pure oxygen propellant.</a> The resulting explosion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">knocked out the engines</a> and the <em>Chokai</em> had to be scuttled.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Mordhau</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12xkwd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12xkwd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12xkwd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"murder-stroke" or "murder-strike"</span> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanSwordsmanship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanSwordsmanship">German school of swordsmanship</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonus</a> applies why it is forbidden in friendly combat where the aim is NOT to kill your opponent. True, it may seem odd how, in a fight with big, sharp implements it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableUseOfAWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableUseOfAWeapon">smashing someone with the handle</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note134fki');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note134fki" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note134fki');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">specifically, grasping the sword by the blade and using the pommel as a mace</span> that's forbidden, but that thing is heavy, and tends to ignore the fact the victim's wearing metal armor<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1409ca');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1409ca" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1409ca');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">like a mace, it can easily cause blunt injuries through armor</span>. It has that name for a <em>reason</em>.
</li><li> In soccer, the awesome techniques of jumping up in the air and trying to hit a ball next to another player is usually forbidden, because it could hurt the other player if he'd get hit by a flying boot. A little more mild, but still similar is the "scissors" technique of scoring.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Nuclear weapons</a>. Nukes are capable of great destruction, but actually using one comes at a hefty price. Large nuclear detonations release irradiated material into the surrounding environment that remains dangerous long after the explosion is over. In a more immediate sense, several nations have active nuclear weapons that are kept ready for launch at all times. Since there is currently no viable way to defend against a nuclear weapon after it's been launched, the target has no reason not to fire all its weapons at the aggressor. This is the concept of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD) and it effectively makes using nukes suicidal. Note that in World War II, this was not an issue; with no other nuclear-capable countries to provide the "Mutual" portion of MAD, the United States was free to attack Japan without fear of similar retribution.
<ul><li> Though eight nations are declared to have nuclear weapons (and one is suspected) most nuclear powers refuse to consider using nuclear weapons unless someone else does first. Nowadays, the worry is more about the dangers of non-state actors (ie. terrorists) using them instead, which MAD is essentially powerless against.
</li><li> Even nukes aren't necessarily as repellent as biological warfare. At least a nuclear weapon only destroys its targeted area, however horribly; use of biological agents as weapons poses a <em>very</em> real risk of infecting everyone the contagion touches, be they enemy, ally, innocent bystanders, or one's own side.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope is usually defied in real life, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatism</a> being a time-honored military and general combative doctrine. If it's dangerous and highly lethal, using it is the best way to win. If it's forbidden, all the better because that means the other guy will never see it coming.
</li><li> There are international <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">Laws and Customs of War</a>, that ban war tactics such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst">shooting the medic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">deliberately harming civilians</a>
</li><li> Overdosing on caffeine as a deadline draws nearer.
<ul><li> Recreational drugs in general, actually. The more intense a drug's effects are, the more likely it is to cause harm if not moderated, along with the need for more strict moderation. And the more intense effects you experience, the more curious you'll get for even stronger experiences. Though just because an experience is weak doesn't mean the damage is light: air duster as an extreme example. Alcohol is an aversion, though: drinking more after getting buzzed actually decreases the euphoria and eventually can cause severe depression and rage.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a popular recipe among Russian students which consists of mixing 50 ml of Coke with 2 teaspoons of granulated coffee. Due to how it works on your body (Coke pretty much expands your blood vessels and makes caffeine go into the bloodstream much faster, multipliplying its effect), it can give you a huge energy boost for 8 to 14 hours. On the other side, even a single cup can have some harmful effects on your health, from high blood pressure to body tremors, not to mention that it's a guaranteed way to ruin your sleep schedule.
</li><li> Not exactly a technique, but human muscles are actually so strong that they can <em>rip themselves off your bones</em>. Usually, the body has all kinds of limitations on itself to prevent it from happening, like pain. But in situations where super strength is the meaning of life or death (like being slowly crushed under some heavy boulder), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UninhibitedMusclePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UninhibitedMusclePower">the body can drop these limits by itself</a>. It'll save your life when needed but at a really really painful cost. It will eventually heal, <em>if</em> you're able to find a doctor who can properly set your broken bones and muscles so that the ligaments and tendons heal naturally. And, also, you'll need to follow his protocols for recovery <em>to the letter</em>.
</li><li> Steroids, blood doping, performance enhancing drugs and other methods are illegal in most official events, partly for this reason.
</li><li> Water methanol injection, also called as War Emergency Power, on turbocharged internal combustion engines. Injecting 1:1 water-methanol mixture to the combustion chamber can boost the performance of the engine for up to 33% and add up extra horsepowers. It basically acts as a chemical intercooler. Unfortunately, its prolonged use (we speak about minutes here) will also damage the cylinder heads. In WWII, its use was approved only for emergency situations, like an airplane escaping from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">particularly nasty enemy</a>, and using the mechanism involved on breaking the seals. On Allied planes, this 'seal' was a thin wire stretched across the throttle assembly at the point where WEP would engage. The wire was strong enough to prevent a pilot from accidentally activating WEP, but could be broken fairly easily if the pilot deliberately pushed the throttle; the idea was, when the mechanics back at base inspected the plane after a mission, they would check this wire. If the wire was intact, the engine was okay, but if it was broken, then the mechanics knew the engine would have to be pulled out of the plane and rebuilt.
<ul><li> Likewise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NitroBoost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NitroBoost">nitrous oxide injection</a> called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">''Ha-Ha-Gerät''</a> in the Luftwaffe, which acts as a chemical <em>turbocharger</em>. It will boost the performance, but long periods of use will seriously damage the engine.
</li><li> This is the effect of pushing the engine past its rated limits. What's on paper is what the manufacturer has safely determined the engine will go up to without dying sooner than how long it's expected to last. You could always push an engine harder, but doing so wears it out faster. Sometimes <em>much</em> faster, if the strain you put on the engine passes what its structural integrity can handle, causing it to tear itself apart or burst into flames.
</li><li> In modern military aircraft, afterburners can certainly count in some cases. The way they work is by taking raw jet fuel from your tanks and spraying it directly into the VERY hot exhaust section of the engine. This, in turn, adds up to a sudden burst of power from the engine which will get your aircraft from just barely scratching the sound barrier to moving twice the speed of sound in the span of a minute or so depending on the aircraft. This comes at a price, however. Normally, afterburner use is relegated to take off, or on a bolter<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15vsa2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15vsa2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15vsa2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> When a naval aircraft misses all of the wires and needs the extra power to get back in the air</span>. These short bursts normally don't do much damage to the engine, but using it too often (as in the case with most dogfights), can shorten the life span of your engine, meaning it'll have to be changed out once you return to base. However, use the afterburners too much, and you won't even have to worry about that, because your aircraft will eventually clunk into the ground with not even a drop of fuel left in the tanks.
</li></ul></li><li> 'Cooking off' grenades involves pulling the pin and allowing it to tick closer to detonation before throwing it to the target. Successfully pulling it off results in the grenade exploding mid-air, showering the enemy with shrapnel while giving them less time (if any) to pick it up and throw it somewhere else. Failure results in the grenade exploding in your hand, which is unpleasant, to say the least. The fuse of a grenade is not so exact that you dare do this; there's enough wiggle room that you (and any member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad">The Squad</a> standing too close) can be reduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMist">Pink Mist</a> while you think you still have a little more time. And if you happen to get shot, lethally or not, with a cooked grenade in your hand...
</li><li> Overclocking a PC's CPU can help squeeze in a performance boost, but this is not something to be done casually; without a good cooling system to offset the increased generation of heat, overclocking is a good way to ensure that you'll be shopping for a costly replacement CPU.
</li><li> Believe it or not, there is one when playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a>: The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB8Xp4PMvbQ">Bang Back<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> technique involves giving a nice solid punch to the bottom of the machine. When done as the ball is traveling down the left outlane and into the drain, you can potentially save it and continue playing. Doing so, however, will probably hurt your fist and damage the machine with it. Even more so during the time manufacturers installed nails onto the bottom to impale the hands of players who attempted this. Nevertheless, the potential harm the Bang Back can do, as well as the technique allowing you to keep playing for far longer than is intended, means even attempting one is grounds for instant disqualification at all tournaments, big or small.
</li><li> Bee's stings. They cause enough pain to their victim that they're either out of commission or deterred from attacking their hive. They also involve the bee's stinger embedding itself in the victim's flesh dragging the poison sac (and several vital organs) along with it, killing the insect. For this reason, bees only sting in response to a serious threat to their hive or queen.
<ul><li> However, this only applies to certain kinds of bees. While not wasteful of their stings, other bees CAN live after stinging.
</li><li> This only applies to vertebrates, however. Bees can sting *insects* with impunity as their stingers have no problems with exoskeletons. They just get stuck in fleshier victims. Their (lack of) aggression has more complicated evolutionary origins and depends largely on the individual species.
