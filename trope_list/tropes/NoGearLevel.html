</li><li> The Silent Realms qualify as this as well because it's your spirit who takes the test. So no tools or weapons of any kind. If you alert an enemy, you'll just have to run away from them. To make it harder, they can kill you and wipe all your progress if they hit you one single time.

These levels are focused on puzzles and platforming with enemies you have to avoid or find a way to disable them.
</li><li> It's worth noting that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em>, where you lose almost everything, med kits included, said loss is permanent. In addition, the player decides what order to complete the middle three of the five areas in, and if you pick a certain area last... Well, sucks to be you. It doesn't help that said area is listed as the last of the three in most official material.
</li><li> The final chapter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderChronicles">Tomb Raider Chronicles</a></em> has one level where Lara must give up her weapon by placing it on a tray because the hallway nearby is a security scanner. Trying to go through it with a weapon will trigger some turrets and kill you quickly. Until you can disable the security scanner, Lara can either use chloroform to knock out guards or just avoid being spotted.

However, there are still sections in which Ratchet is incapable of using Clank and his abilities, therefore relying on much more precise platforming, and arena levels which restrict Ratchet to one gun, or even just his wrench.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankSizeMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankSizeMatters">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Size Matters</a></em> features Ratchet kidnapped and sedated, playing through a trippy dream level. When he wakes up, he finds himself stripped of his guns and must use his wrench and the guns of his that he finds strewn on the ground as he makes his way out. Eventually, he'll find the entire rest of his arsenal stowed away. Frustratingly, the game does not keep track of the way your quick select was organized before the level, and you'll have to reorder your inventory every single time you play this level.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigAdventure">Little Big Adventure</a></em> features a jail which strips you of your items, conveniently stored nearby once you disable the guard who comes into your cell, naively.
</li><li> During the final boss fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, all of your brush powers, the ones that you spent the whole game acquiring, are stripped away. In order to get them back, you must damage the boss the old-fashioned way — pummeling the crap out of it with melee attacks until you get them all back. This also occurs during normal gameplay if you are careless enough to run out of ink — your weapon vanishes as well, leaving you to fight with tooth and claw. Horrible during boss fights. Luckily, ink replenishes.
</li><li> In the <em>Prince of Persia</em> games:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2">Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame</a></em> has you drop your sword into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a> at the end of an unusual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> with a skeleton. This forces you to run from enemies until early in the next level, where you find a short sword which isn't as good. (Fortunately, you get to replace it with a better weapon two levels later.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheSandsOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheSandsOfTime">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a></em>, near the end of the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Farah steals both your sword and the Dagger of Time to go complete the mission on her own</span>. Thankfully, you get a ridiculously powerful replacement sword a few minutes later, but not before you have to run for your life from some hulking monsters. Unfortunately, it takes longer to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">get the Dagger back</span>, meaning you have to be <em>very</em> careful as you inch along hundred-feet high scaffolds.
</li><li> This actually happens twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaWarriorWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaWarriorWithin">Prince of Persia: Warrior Within</a></em>. Near the beginning the Prince's ship crashes and he loses his sword. Once washed ashore, he has to do with a piece of driftwood and whatever secondary weapon he managed to grab off the enemies (amusingly, those weapons break with use, while piece of wood <em>doesn't</em>.) Then after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dahaka</span> breaks his primary sword again. And the next sequence of levels involves eventually finding a new one. Said broken sword does absolutely no damage so you're stuck using grab moves and whatever secondary weapons you can scrounge up. Probably most problematic is that you're not likely to notice that your sword is broken until you actually get into a fight and realize your sword isn't what it used to be...
</li><li> The whole thing is lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheTwoThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersiaTheTwoThrones">Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones</a></em>, where the Prince laments, "Why is it that every time disaster strikes, I find myself without a proper blade?" (This reference goes all the way back to the original <em>Prince of Persia</em>, where you start out unarmed.) Following that, you get a tutorial about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickTimeEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickTimeEvent">Quick Time Event</a> stealth-kills with a random knife he picks up.

Including the infinite-ammo rubber-band ball and the infinite-ammo slingshot. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a> to finish your grudge.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>, you lose access to all your selectable powers except for disguise for two whole chapters. Particularly annoying as it's an open world game, and you don't gain them back <em>between</em> chapters, limiting the number of side-missions you can do successfully at that time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Psygnosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Psygnosis">Psygnosis</a>' <em>O.D.T: Escape Or Die Trying</em> has a level where you exit a prison and get jumped by four wardens.

It's really difficult not being able to fight Wolfens or use your Boomy.

You keep your fighting combos, but lose other skills like double-jump and dash, and you have no way to heal. When you catch up with the little runt he'll surrender your stuff, but sometimes there's a Cave Troll in between...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></em> has Fox get imprisoned and his magic staff (the only piece of equipment he has, but which contains the staff powers he has gained thus far) taken off him in one stage. The stage thus revolves around sneaking around the prison to get the power needed to get it back by fooling the guard into thinking you're his replacement, so he'll leave.

In which, all you have is a torch and your fists until you find your things. Granted, weapons are scattered along the way to make it easier.

<ul><li> The SNES version of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> has you stripped of all weapons before stage 3, save for the pistol. All you have is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon">Lawgiver</a> the entire game. You just lose the rest of your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">Abnormal Ammo</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AlienVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AlienVsPredator">Alien vs. Predator</a> 2</em> has two of those (disarming an alien is somewhat... difficult). For the marine, it happens pretty early in the game and is a rather standard scenario. You are helped by the fact that a fellow prisoner hands you a knife (well, you grab it off his barely-cold body...) and the first enemy soldier posthumously donates you a pistol about six seconds after the mission starts. The predator is trapped, shot unconscious and shipped off to the human base for research. For obvious reasons, the scientists try to disarm their prisoners, but hesitate when taking off the arm blades of the first one induces cardiac arrest in the specimen. The predators <em>do not like</em> being without a weapon...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryTheHandsomeExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarryTheHandsomeExecutive">Harry the Handsome Executive</a></em> makes this slightly more bearable than some other examples — the same challenges that cost you your weapons gain you magical powers.
</li><li> The final boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe">Viewtiful Joe</a> 2</em> strips Joe and Silvia of their movie superhero powers. All the abilities you've bought and learned are gone. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after a short pre-fight using their weaker forms, the spectators use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> to revitalize the duo.</span>

</li><li> A variation exists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101">The Wonderful 101</a></em>: During one level, you have all the skills and items you've acquired over the game, but you start the level with just ten Wonderful Ones in your party. For reference, when you first open a new save file, you start the game with <em>twenty</em>. This makes it extremely difficult to make use of Unite Morphs since a single hit scatters your forces every which way until you gather them up again. As a result, even weak enemies that were obsolete from the second level are suddenly challenging again since your attack power is weak and your evasive options are often locked due to a lack of Wonderful Ones.
<ul><li> this level is a test of your understanding of recruiting mechanic. The very first mission features enemies that can teleport in waves of small mooks and the only thing for you to do is to steal mooks into your crowd without killing them. The time requirement takes into account that this will takes some time and is sufficiently relaxed.
</li></ul></li><li> Certain stretches of level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em> have Jim teleported outside of his Super Suit, having to make due with pure platforming.

However, unlike many other games, you are immediately re-armed with a lot of good weapons and tools the moment you escape, making this much less of a pain, unless you rely too much on Assault Rifles or Shotguns.
<ul><li> Also due to the fact that ammo has no mass or volume in Deus Ex, despite taking away the player's heavily modified and upgraded rocket launcher, the bad guys were kind enough to leave JC the stack of twenty rockets sticking out of his pockets, meaning that more than likely the instant you FIND a weapon you'll have enough ammo to liberate several more.
</li><li> One nasty stumbling block is that if, when you finally reach the armoury that contains your own heavily-modded equipment, you have a standard weapon (such as one recovered from one of the guards) equipped, then picking up your modded item of the same type <em>destroys</em> that weapon, recovering only the ammo it was loaded with. If you've collected unmodded replacements for all your original weapons by the time you reach the armoury, it's entirely possible to do this to all your original gear, never even realising that it was <em>your</em> upgraded items in there at all, and have to start from scratch re-upgrading your items.
<ul><li> It can also be circumvented entirely - just quickly press the menu button, drop your gear and re-equip it, then tear through there with great ease.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Missing Link", a DLC chapter for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em>, takes Adam's gear and disables his augmentations at the start. You retain your basic abilities, including Adam's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">One-Hit KO</a> takedowns, but you don't get your original gear back, since the chapter is stand-alone from the rest of the game.
<ul><li> The Director's Cut downplays this: at the start of <em>The Missing Link</em>, you are depowered, lose all of your gear, and keep only your money, forcing you to make do with what you can grab. However, you are quickly directed to a stash that contains a small number of Praxis kits and all of your weapons — but no ammunition, and none of your grenades/mines or other items. At the end of the chapter, just before returning to the main story, you are given the opportunity to grab all of your original gear, and get enough Praxis points (combined with any you earned during the chapter) to bring you back up to your original level of ability. It also allows you to essentially respec, since you get the points, not your original abilities you had before.

All other weapons are presumably destroyed or lost when Shepard is caught in an explosion prior to reaching the ship, which also reduces their armor to a charred mostly destroyed undershirt.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rune">Rune</a></em> was billed as a game where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">manly vikings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigfootSasquatchAndYeti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigfootSasquatchAndYeti">yetis</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">dwarves</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">giant zombies</a> chop each other to pieces with swords so huge they don't even fit on the screen.

This makes for a challenging stealth section for a character who invested in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">light-side force powers</a> and so relied exclusively on their guns and saber for damage, and a laughably easy slaughterfest for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage">dark-side adept.</a>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> series has the occasional optional quest that you can only sign up for if you are not wearing any armor or talismans. You can still use your usual weapon, but with only food buffs, your weapon's defense if it even has any, and pouch items for defense, you become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> who can't afford to take any hits.

The bigger problem is moreso that the weapon mechanics in this game revolve around allowing you to block opponents' weapons with your own, so not being able to use any pretty much makes you a sitting duck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyHunter">Spy Hunter</a></em> has a No Gear Level Section, the very first part of "German Blitz" starts you in one of the civilian vehicles.

In fact, this happens twice. And both of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Missions</a>. In the first one, you have the option of leaving Natalya in her cell until you've cleared out the rest of the base.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgentUnderFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgentUnderFire">Agent Under Fire</a></em>, you can actually prevent this from happening, if you find a keycard before you enter the submarine in the Poseidon level.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XIII">XIII</a></em>: In a particularly creepy instance of the trope, you must escape from an insane asylum.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightIIJediOutcast">Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast</a></em>; you have your main weapons confiscated upon entering a bar in one level, but are otherwise unrestricted and get to keep your lightsaber. Since it's the first level where you <em>have</em> the saber, it could be seen as a way of forcing the player to start relying on the saber rather than guns.
<ul><li> Played with in the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediAcademy">Jedi Academy</a></em>: there is a level in which the player is captured and stripped of all weapons and then has to escape. Gathering weapons is not difficult, as there are plenty lying around, but the player <em>is</em> denied one of the most powerful weapons in the game — the lightsaber. This is deliberate on the part of Jaden's captor, who's created a blood sport out of letting dangerous prisoners try to escape while he hunts them down. Of course, he's never hunted a <em>Jedi</em> before, and doesn't consider finding a way to take away the other most powerful set of weapons in the game: Jaden's force powers. One of the simplest and most cathartic strategies when you face the guy is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Force Push the shots of his concussion rifle right back into his face</a>.
</li><li> Also in predecessor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForces">Dark Forces</a></em> — Kyle Katarn gets captured by Jabba the Hutt's henchmen and dropped into a pit with at least one kell dragon. Fortunately, he can dodge its attacks and kill it with enough hits from his fists.
</li><li> And again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightMysteriesOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightMysteriesOfTheSith">Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith</a></em> after a bad case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">Cutscene Incompetence</a> <em>Mara Jade</em> is captured and thrown into a Hutt's dungeon. Force on her side, she easily escapes, but has to wrestle a Rancor in the process.
<ul><li> Though it <em>is</em> possible to recover your lightsaber by Force Pulling it while standing in the right place.
</li><li> Additionally, in the last level none of your weapons except for your lightsaber even <em>work</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Happens fairly early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronTwoPointOh">Tron 2.0</a></em>. Particularly irritating in that one of the weapons you lose costs energy to acquire in the first place — energy which might have been better spent elsewhere — and upon losing it you cannot retrieve it (you do eventually get your frisbee back, though, and are also given a new weapon to make up for it). And there are several infinite (and, until you leave the level, infinitely reusable) energy sources between the time you acquire the weapon and the time you are relieved of it.
</li><li> One of the levels later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> has you held prisoner on an alien starship. After waking up, you realize that the only weapons you have are a throwing knife and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">your fists</a>. Strangely enough, this is one of two levels that not only doesn't require, but doesn't <em>allow</em>, some degree of stealth. It's not much of a hassle to collect another weapon though, since you can disarm the aliens and take their blaster pistol. Be careful, though: Using all of your ammunition before destroying the computer terminals immediately fails the mission.
<ul><li> Earlier on, you must sneak into an air base to infiltrate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a>, and on higher difficulties, one of the objectives forces you to drop off all your weapons at the baggage check so you can get through security without your disguise being compromised. It doesn't become a problem until you deactivate the security system so they're not detected, because that's when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">NSA agents</a> decide to spring their plan and shoot up the place.
</li><li> The virtual deathmatch in <em>Perfect Dark Zero</em> starts you off with only a MagSec4 pistol, while Mai Hem is armed with a Superdragon assault rifle. Fortunately, if you activated the sattelite dish earlier, Chandra can hack the game and send you an M-60 machine gun.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom 3</a></em>, shortly after deciding whether to call the fleet or not, the PC's teleported to hell and loses all his weapons. Then you're fighting the big monsters you've been saving rocket shells for with a shotgun and dead ends.
<ul><li> Back in <em>Doom 1</em>, the game was divided into episodes. Starting a new episode meant starting with a pistol again. Also, in <em>Doom 1 <strong>and</strong> Doom 2</em>, if you die, you'll restart the current level with 100 health and a pistol unless you saved beforehand.
</li><li> The <em>Doom 2</em> mod <em>Vanguard</em> has the player die at the end of level 5, forcing him to go through level 6 (aptly named "Punchline") with nothing but a pistol and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerFist">berserk fist</a>. All these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">imps and zombiemen</a> suddenly become a real threat, and the moment where you get the shotgun back gives you the "yeah, I'm back in the game!" feeling.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>, a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> who want revenge for you "killing their buddies" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">never mind that they started it</a>) dump you in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendingCeiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescendingCeiling">the trash compactor from</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, taking away all your weapons in the process.
<ul><li> Partial example, partial reversal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>: you're stripped of all weapons except for the gravity gun, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">which gets upgraded</a>.
</li><li> Also inverted in <em>Half-Life 2: Episode 1</em>, in that it happens early in the game before you have much of a weapon collection, and the gravity gun is immediately turbo-charged to use for more gameplay goodness than HL2 allowed with it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em>, captured by Pig Cops. After the <em>second level</em>. And if one isn't paying attention, they'll die instantly at the start of the next level: the pigs are going to electrocute Duke via electric chair!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade">Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</a></em>, captured by stealth soldiers. However in this case you never get back the weapons taken from you, and have to rebuild your arsenal from almost scratch, save your pistol. Also interestingly, as soon as you rescue any given prisoner, they automatically get a gatling gun from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hammerspace">seemingly nowhere</a>. You never recover your reliable, accurate assault rifle either. Sniff.
<ul><li> Possibly because the chaingun is (oddly) just as accurate, and you have better weapons to use down the line like the laser rifle which is also accurate
</li></ul></li><li> This occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Postal">Postal</a> 2</em>, when not only are you knocked out and kidnapped, but you wake up dressed in a Gimp suit. After escaping and getting your weapons back, you then have to go to the laundromat to change back to your regular clothes.
<ul><li> An optional version in the police department, if you gain notoriety with the police and allow them to arrest you. They take away everything except for your box of matches. Like above, it's possible to regain everything you had beforehand.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens three times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedFaction">Red Faction</a></em>. In all three cases, you are able to rebuild your arsenal the same way you built it in the first place (taking guns off dead enemies), but whatever weapons and ammo you had originally are lost. On the plus side, one of these sequences can be skipped — just ignore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaButterfly">Hendrix</a>'s insistence that you need a disguise in the hospital.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> has this, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">Cutscene Incompetence</a> in that you get ambushed in a way that a real person never would; but it simultaneously invokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutscenePowerToTheMax">Cutscene Power to the Max</a> by letting you survive damage that a real person couldn't.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry">Far Cry</a></em> uses the trope in an uncommonly logical manner: You actually <em>start</em> the game unarmed after a shipwreck, and spend the first level seeking out weapons and armor before actually taking on the people who shipwrecked you. A more typical example occurs later, toward the end, when you lose everything after getting captured.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCryInstincts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCryInstincts">Far Cry Instincts</a></em> does this <em>three</em> times, though logically; the first time, you're crawling out of a shipwreck with only your switchblade, while the second time you've been captured, and the third time you've just woken up from surgery to find you've beaten fifty men to death with your bare hands and all hell has broken loose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em> has essentially no connection to the previous game, but in one level you and your main buddy are captured and taken to a prison. Oddly enough they leave your machete on you but take your guns, but there's very little fighting in the prison itself; it's a short run straight out of the cells past no guards to get outside, and from there you can sneak up on a hut on the road and steal some supplies. As soon as you get out of the prison you're able to get to a gun dealer and totally restock.
</li><li> Also happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">Far Cry 3</a></em>, when you get captured, twice in a row. The first time, you find a basic gun pretty quickly, and it's all you need to escape. The second time, you still have your machete, and are able to kill a guard quickly to get his gun, but it's not terribly useful, since the gun is neither silenced (so no easy stealth kills from range) nor powerful enough to adequately deal with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavilyArmoredMook">Heavy Trooper</a> guarding the shack with your supplies.
</li><li> After starting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3BloodDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3BloodDragon">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</a></em> with the upgraded versions of the game's weapons, you're stripped of them all and forced to sneak past a herd of the titular Blood Dragons, either to emphasize how "unstoppable" they are or just to scare the crap out of the player.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4">Far Cry 4</a></em> has Durgesh Prison. Not only are you stripped of your gear but you're also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">doped out of your gourd</a> on hallucinogenic drugs which make you see a big monster thing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">that can in fact kill you</a></em>. It's worn off by the time you've scrounged to build a grappling hook and descended the cliff, but now you have to deal with armed guards until you escape the area.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry5">Far Cry 5</a></em> does this to an annoying extent, as there are numerous unavoidable scripted events where you're automatically captured and have your gear taken away. While you can instantly regain all your weapons for free once you make it to a weapon shop, your ammo is permanently lost, forcing you to scrounge or buy more, which is annoying when it comes to expensive types like rockets and .50 calibur rounds.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleWolfenstein">Castle Wolfenstein</a></em>
<ul><li> Some of the mods for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a></em> had individual levels where you started off without weapons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em> begins this way. The Xbox version added an extra chapter before the opening, which makes it more of this trope when you're thrown in prison without your weapons.
</li><li> Shows up again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinTheOldBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinTheOldBlood">Wolfenstein: The Old Blood</a></em>, when BJ is once again captured and has to escape from the titular castle - this time beginning only with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PipePain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PipePain">lengths of pipe</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheConduit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheConduit">The Conduit</a></em>, you can finish a level armed to the max with your favorite weapons — including rare super-weapons with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> capability — and then lose them all when you transition to the next level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em> has Fontaine Fisheries, where Peach Wilkins won't let you advance unless you turn over all your weapons. You fight through the freezer area using only plasmids and a wrench, though you can find one or two dropped guns. Just to twist the knife, almost all of your meticulously saved ammo is "missing" when you <em>do</em> recover your weapons. That said, it is possible and in fact quite easy to cheat and bring a weapon in with you, as the gate which opens when you surrender your guns doesn't close again if you pick up another one and it's possible to carry items around with the telekinesis plasmid without collecting them.
</li><li> This happens three-fifths of the way through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Resistance">Resistance</a> 3</em>, after Joseph Capelli is captured by the Wardens. Interestingly, you start with getting two new weapons before you ever recover the old ones: The Sledgehammer and the Mutator, and the returning weapons you do get at first are the rather low-tech ones; the Carbine and the Magnum, for example. The most interesting part, however, is that you <em>don't</em> actually end up recovering all of your weapons by the end of the level, and you'll arrive at the next only to check your quick select and realize that they still aren't there. Fortunately, you recover them fairly quickly after this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> has its fair share of this. It happens over five times when combining all three games. As Jason Jones once said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">"ah, grasshopper, the most accessible weapon of all is your own fists, you must learn to lay aside your weapons of steel and use your flesh."</a> He said in response to some people saying how it was impossible to do a couple levels in the first game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Vidmaster-style</a> as there were no weapon pickups in those level, and Vidmaster-style means starting with level select (which means nothing but the pistol plus a couple clips for it and your fists that you start with). There is one level which could not be completed using level select unless using mods, though, as getting out of the first room required triggering a switch remotely, and the pistol can't do that.
</li><li> <em>Turning Point: Fall of Liberty</em> strips you of your guns and ammo at the end of each level and replaces them with 1 or 2 preset guns (often not very good).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a> 2</em> has one of the most intense levels of the game, when Soap, Ghost, and Roach fight their way through a Favela. Near the end of the level, your squad requires you evacuate. Cue running across rooftops. Of course, you miss a gap, fall off a ledge, and black out. You don't have time to reclaim your weapons, so you run half a mile through a massive slum to get back to the rooftops without the weapons you were kicking ass with earlier, with an entire militia on your tail, and make a breakneck jump to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator">"get to the chopper"</a>, with a final leap that pays homage to the original daring escape made by Soap in Call of Duty 4 on the cargo rig.
<ul><li> The first <em>Modern Warfare</em> has "Hunted", where the player's chopper gets shot down on the way back from the "Blackout" level and you start out with only a pistol and your choice of some regular assault rifles and/or an SMG, rather than the extensively-modified assault rifle with grenade launcher and silenced sniper rifle you had for the previous level.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyGhosts">Call of Duty: Ghosts</a></em> features several instances in which the player is left with at most a pistol and must either hide or take weapons from enemy troops:
<ul><li> The very first level is technically a no gear level, as the player is at this point in the game a civilian fleeing the attack on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">his hometown</a>.
</li><li> One segment of "Federation Day" has the player character lose his weapons after falling from a collapsing building, leaving him only with his knife.
</li><li> After Rorke escapes capture, the player is left to sneak past enemy patrols, armed only with a silenced pistol.
</li><li> The player again is left only with a pistol after being captured by Rorke. Subverted in this instance, however, as not only does the player have two highly competent AI allies, but also almost immediately has access to a rack of assault and sniper rifles - he or she even has a choice of preferred optic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em> does this constantly. In <em>The First Encounter</em>, it was actually a variation of it where, at the end of one level, most of your ammo is dropped during a long trek to make the travel easier (Sam only keeps shotgun shells), but your weapons still remain. In <em>The Second Encounter</em> and <em>Serious Sam II</em>, Sam loses weapons after every chapter due to teleportation restrictions. In the last chapter of <em>Serious Sam II</em>, you'll lose your weapons by being captured. In <em>Serious Sam 3: BFE</em>, you lose all your weapons in a helicopter crash at one point.
</li><li> This is a severe punishment in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodwingsPumpkinheadsRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodwingsPumpkinheadsRevenge">Bloodwings: Pumpkinhead's Revenge</a></em>, for apparently if you take anything from a certain cutscene that was not actually a scene from the movie, a group of children will warn you to put it back. If you choose to deny their demand, they strip you of your entire inventory, thus pretty much rendering the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>.
</li><li> In the 'Sudden Death' mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, triggered when a match ends in a stalemate, all classes of both teams are forced to use their (in almost all cases quite damaging) melee weapons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. This originated as a custom game modifier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">that Valve applied across the board</a>.
<ul><li> One of the "Roll The Dice" results leaves you with only the use of your Melee weapons and nothing else. A slap on the wrist if you're next to your spawn, a death sentence for any spy behind enemy lines now left with only his knife (but no disguise kit or cloak watch).
</li></ul></li><li> Happens several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">F.E.A.R.</a></em> and sequels.
<ul><li> In <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, several psychic vision sequences in the final Interval inexplicably make all of Point Man's weapons vanish and equip him with a pistol.
</li><li> <em>F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin</em> strips Becket of his gear after the first level, as he is critically injured by the nuclear explosion (from the first game) and taken to Armacham's hospital where he later wakes up.
</li><li> In <em>F.E.A.R. 3</em>, Point Man manages to lose his entire inventory at the beginning of every single level. In the later levels he at least starts out armed, but often only with a basic pistol and submachine gun at most. An attempt is made to justify this by having nearly every level begin with Point Man recovering from some destructive event, such as a helicopter crash, a flood, falling off a bridge, etc, in which he'd naturally lose much of his gear.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SiN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SiN">Si N</a></em>, John Blade is mutated into a monster right after one of the later stages, and spends a whole level (plus an optional bonus one) running through dangerous and deadly test chambers before being turned back into a human, which immediately reverts him back to his human form - along with all his weapons, ammo and special items returning (with no explanation of where they were in the interim).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoldierOfFortune">Soldier of Fortune</a> II</em> has Mullins stripped of his weapons and imprisoned in Hong Kong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheDarkness">The Darkness</a> II</em> has a late level where Jackie loses the titular quasi-demonic power and has to rely on ordinary weapons to clear a cellar full of baddies.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorFrontline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorFrontline">Frontline</a></em> has two levels which start you off with nothing but a pistol. Luckily, in the latter (Clipping Their Wings), there's a stash of heavy weapons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousVideoGameGenerosity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousVideoGameGenerosity">which you'll definitely need</a>.
</li><li> In the middle level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorAlliedAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorAlliedAssault">Allied Assault</a></em>'s "Behind Enemy Lines" mission, you start with only a silenced pistol, and have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">infiltrate a tank encampment</a> by stowing away on an enemy truck (unless you prefer the hard way). Luckily, there's a Kar 98 sniper rifle just after this part, and plenty of SMG's and ammo.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em> has a brief one of these. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Loyalists turn on you and poison you</span>, you are left for dead in a prison cell with all of your gear thrown to the bottom of a shaft. You can make your way back to this shaft to recover everything if you so choose. It will also net you the achievement/trophy "This is mine".
</li><li> Played straight and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliensColonialMarines">Aliens: Colonial Marines</a></em>. One level has Winter being captured and cocooned (but escaping before being facehugged), and losing all his weapons in the process. However, O'Neal somehow managed to save all of Winter's equipment in a duffle bag, and gives it back to him near the end of the level. Later on, after the Marine dropship crashs and destroy everything onboard, the player retains all their weapons, but they don't make a dent in the xenomorph queen (necessitating the usage of a cargo drop mechanism to push her out of a ship).
</li><li> After finding your target underneath the Train Yard in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSixVegas">Rainbow Six: Vegas</a>,</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hidden bombs blow up and bury you under a pile of rock, while your teammates are captured</span>. Your primary weapons, grenades, equipment, and enhanced optics are all taken from you, forcing you to go through the level with only your pistol (and anything you can scavenge from the enemy, mostly shotguns). Hope you picked a good sidearm all the way back at the last ammo crate half an hour ago.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall2">Titanfall 2</a></em>, where Jack has been captured and BT wrecked.

The SERE kit includes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Homing pistol</a>, which allows you to gun down entire squads of grunts without so much as slowing down. At the end of the sequence, a spare chassis is dropped down for BT to be installed into, which already has all the Titan Kits you've collected over the course of the game, as well as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Legion</a> loadout.

<ul><li> This is essentially the entire purpose of the Exemplar/Malefactor (Cross-level team) and Flashback (repeating a quest) features in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> and <em>City of Villains</em>. The game doesn't make extensive use of in-game items, but you receive an effective level reduction, losing access to any abilities and enhancements you achieved after the level you've been reduced to.
</li><li> The idea behind the Kung Fu Hustler skill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> is to turn the character with it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Bare-Fisted Monk</a>: if you have it and don't have any weapons equipped, you get four intrinsic effects that boost your power by a considerable amount. If you equip weapons (or off-hand items which aren't weapons), you lose the effects at the start of your next combat.
<ul><li> Also used in one of the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">Self-Imposed Challenge</a> paths, "Way of the Surprising Fist", which gives you the opportunity to learn some powerful martial-arts moves but prevents you from using weapons or off-hand items. In fact, you can get a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticReward">trophy</a> for acquiring both Kung Fu Hustler and Master of the Surprising Fist as permanent skills.
</li><li> In Hobopolis, one of the multiplayer dungeons, the boss Zombo has the ability to literally scare your pants, hat and shirt off. Additionally, leaving him alive for the Hodgman the Hoboverlord fight, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of Hobopolis, will cause Zombo to scare your gear off during his battle.
</li></ul></li><li> Salvage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> strips players of the ability to use all gear upon entering (the excuse is something about psychowaves in the ruins). Special cells dropped by enemies can be used to lift the equipment restrictions, slot by slot.
<ul><li> Several bosses have abilities which strip the players gear when hit with them. Virtually any serious player uses extensive macro'ed gear swaps to maximize the effect of every action they take, so it's generally not an issue to instantly reequip everything with the click one a single macro. Players without such macros however have an ordeal of trying to reequip everything mid combat through the clunky aged UI only to find themselves striped again.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld">The Secret World</a></em> you can't just have your gear taken from you; stuff made for you will respawn in your possession the way you yourself do. But there <em>are</em> ways to disable most of your supernatural abilities within an area, rendering it all inaccessible. This is one of the ways the game (which has no explicit stealth powers) implements a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a>.
<ul><li> There's even one mission which requires combat without gear. Fortunately, it turns out that among the many hidden triggers implanted in your mind (usually used to explain your differing abilities in cutscenes) includes one for this which loads up a set of boxing- and jujitsu- based skills, backed by the slight physical augmentation you still possess... and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the arc was smart enough to disarm his normally lethally-equipped security force (the point is to keep you locked down; kill you and you could respawn <em>anywhere</em>). The whole thing naturally culminates in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisticuffsBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisticuffsBoss">Fisticuffs Boss</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsofMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsofMystery">ADOM</a></em> twists this by making the player voluntarily give up his equipment. Just hanging inside the Tower of Eternal Flames, fire immunity or no, will randomly and permanently destroy things from your inventory (with fireproof blankets/rings of ice as a partial countermeasure). Falling down the Rift breaks a good portion of your currently carried inventory and the only way to diminish the effect is to have the few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">good/not too awful</a> corruption effects among an array of nasty ones. On both occasions the smart player is forced to stash most of their rarer belongings somewhere and having to get by with only the bare essentials.

<ul><li> Averted strangely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, where your party is sent to jail, but allowed to keep all their weapons and items. Going even further, they're in a cell right next to Cid, who was apparently allowed to keep enough explosives to blow a hole through the wall. The game contains a later instance where this trope is played straight.
</li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, your characters are tossed into a dungeon after being arrested and yet still have all of their weapons and equipment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> your characters are captured and thrown in prison with all their weapons taken from them. Not really a problem since one of your characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">doesn't use weapons</a>. So it's up to him to go alone through the prison to find the weapons (conveniently left in a pile where he can get them easily).
</li><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> inflicts this trope on the <em>player</em> as well. When you enter the final boss's castle, all your combat-menu commands are sealed off, with the exception of standard physical attacks. To regain use of them in the castle, the heroes must win several lesser boss battles, with each victory unlocking a combat command of the player's choice.
</li><li> A stat variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, the fourth form of the final boss can "blow" away the party's junctions, effectively lowering stats to miniscule amounts. Given the way magic junctioning works in this game, it is actually the most terrifying thing the boss can do.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, Yuffie steals all of your materia once you start the Wutai sidequest. (If you have a LOT of materia, she'll actually leave a few, but you're not likely to have enough at the point when the sidequest first opens unless you spent a lot of time grinding.) This is extremely devastating since materia not only gives you your abilities, but it also alters your stats. Without materia, your party is severely gimped, even with the best weapons and armor. To rub the salt in the wound, any materia you find during the side quest is immediately stolen by Yuffie <em>on the spot.</em>
<ul><li> Granted, if you delay it for a brief while, the Temple of the Ancients holds numerous weapons that lack materia slots but have higher than normal base stats, presumably to help compensate for the theft.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfFinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfFinalFantasy">World of Final Fantasy</a></em>, as part of a ploy by the League of S, your two playable characters are imprisoned in the D-District Prison from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, which is located underneath Fiagro Castle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> and which leads into a mako reactor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>. However, as part of the ploy to make it look as real as possible, they're restrained with devices that completely strip away their normal ability to use mirages, or any of the abilities associated with them. Mercifully the prison is filled with the first robotic Mirages you encounter and it's at this point you're given your first Eldboxes that let you capture them. You may not have your normal team, but you don't have to go it alone for more than a couple fights.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> has one of these, along with an earlier imprisonment that for some reason <em>didn't</em> dequip you. In the later case, you indeed lose all your weapons (and all other items) and have to avoid the guards until you get them back, since your characters can't even defend themselves without a weapon equipped. Apparently, you can't cast magic or use tonics without a sword or gun. On the other hand, if your active party includes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> cavewoman who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">laughs at such silly ideas as weapons</a>, she can go to town on them from the get-go.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireDragonQuarter">Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter</a></em>, going into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> sets your level to one (temporarily, thankfully); it doesn't take your equipment, though, and it can be circumvented with Party <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">XP</a>, which can be applied at will (and isn't restricted in said bonus dungeon).
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>, you are stripped of your weapons and tossed in jail, but quickly (and morbidly) retrieve a replacement Long Sword from the body of another prisoner who helps you escape with her last breath. You probably just replaced your starting Long Sword, so it's not too bad... but woe to the gamer too clever for his own good who got the very nice Knight's Saber before triggering the jail scene.
</li><li> In the prologue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a></em> <em>SC</em>, Estelle and Anelace get captured by Jaegers (mercenaries) and wake up in the middle of a forest with all their equipment gone. You gets your stuff back in chests scattered through the dungeon, but for once, this actually makes sense in-universe: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the whole thing turns out to be an elaborate training exercise.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a>: Serpent Isle,</em> you are stripped of all your weapons early on by uncontrolled teleportation magic, but quickly scrape up at least serviceable weaponry. Later on, you are thrown into prison for a crime you may or may not have chosen to actually commit and stripped of all your weapons — only to discover that THIS is where the previous game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> was teleported at the start! The weapon retains all its previous power. Your windfall doesn't last you long, though: To escape the prison, you must destroy the gem in your sword, rendering it powerless — with the demon contained within killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the prison in a rather gory fashion, letting you escape. You still get some other loot in this sequence, meaning that when you get your existing equipment back you end up the richer for having been imprisoned.
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> for this game there are more of this: Three trials that make you fight some enemies, avoid traps and such, all alone and without any of your equipment. Every time you end one of the challenges, you'll end with better and better equipment. The kicker: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The ones who sent you to the trials were your ENEMIES, they were in fact trying to get you killed, and they only managed to make you stronger, richer, and better armed for the next adventures. With enemies like those...</span>
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaIX">Ultima IX</a></em>, which sends the Avatar into Deceit with no weapons or spells at all. Not only do you have to escape the dungeon without them, you have to complete the island's adventures before your equipment is recovered.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em>: Hordes of the Underdark does this at the beginning of the expansion. Not terribly annoying if you start a new character for it, but if you use a character that you used in the original campaign you lose all the gear it had for most of the first chapter. One favourite part of the "Hordes of the Underdark" expansion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> is the zero-magic area of the Beholder Caverns: all of the magical equipment and potions and scrolls and everything else you never realised your epic-level character relied on are reduced to its nonmagical equivalent. This includes the enhancement bonuses and healing items. And what do they throw at you? Level 3 to 5 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">Goddamned Bats</a>. (Actually, non-demonic spiders, but still...) It's a refreshingly, unexpectedly NOT-scrappy level... unless you're a caster, but at that point, you're on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuadraticWizardsLinearWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuadraticWizardsLinearWarriors">quadratic</a> end of the equation anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DivineDivinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DivineDivinity">Divine Divinity</a></em> has a segment when you're captured by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, stripped off your equipments, and thrown into prison. Fortunately, a cat (shapeshifted) comes to your rescue, and you'll be able to get your equipments back right after.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>
<ul><li> When Duster is first introduced as a party member helping Flint climb the mountain, he is dragged from his home, sleeping all the way, by Boney to the mountains before he actually wakes up and thus has none of his thief's tools save for the Wall Staples since they were left behind in his home.
</li><li> Late in the game you lose your entire inventory in an undersea whirlpool after a boss that just can't accept defeat. Your entire party washes up on shore with only 1 HP each, 0 PP, &amp; whatever was equipped during the battle. A monster blocks the way and will annihilate your party in their current state. In their desperation, they resort to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">eating mushrooms growing near where they washed up</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">predictable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">results.</a> (You do get your stuff back on the other side of the jungle, though, after meeting a friendly octopus.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethergate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethergate">Nethergate</a></em> has the three Crones do this to you if you're playing a party of Celts. You do get your equipment back after escaping their maze, and it's not especially difficult. However, it takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a> to infuriating levels, since you can't get across a certain bridge to progress the plot until you go through this sequence.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Anachronox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Anachronox">Anachronox</a></em>, before fighting against the comic-book villain Rictus, he steals your mystech (magic-generating devices), limiting your options for the fight. Once you defeat him, Sly is extatic about becoming the new owner of the ginormous ship... and then remembering the twist ending of one of his comic books. Cue sudden revival, a beatdown, and the whole team being marched into the holding cells with all the other prisoners.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>VII</em> has you travelling to the game's final dungeon requires a brief trek through shark-infested waters while nothing but a wetsuit and a laser blaster. You can't cast any spells , either. You at least get to carry all of your armor with you, so that it can put back on just as quickly as it was taken off once you get there (which, in turn, renders the whole experience little more than a maddening exercise in completely removing everybody's equipment and then putting it right back on).
</li><li> <em>X</em>'s sole DLC starts off after the original game ends with the party getting arrested and thrown in a jail. The first part of it is about manoeuvring to avoid guards so you can find some simple replacement gear and be able to actually fight them. Later on it is possible to get your original gear back — it's technically optional, but you <em>really</em> should, as there is no second chance to get it back once you leave the prison.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens repeatedly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ADanceWithRogues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ADanceWithRogues">A Dance with Rogues</a></em>. It's mostly an excuse to have your character run around naked, though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Dragon Age: Origins  Awakening</a></em>, the entire party has to fight clones of themselves wearing their equipment in order to escape, and the main character's gear is recovered last. With a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">Sequence Breaking</a> (i.e. unequipping all your gear before entering that dungeon—your inventory is not taken away, just your current gear), it can result in you getting free high-level gear, which the clones use in place of weapons that <em>you</em> were supposed to carry.
</li><li> At one point in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> game your party is captured and locked in a room without your weapons. But don't worry, you have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">chaos</a> in your party and he gets to fight the guards on his own.
</li><li> World 3-7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioStickerStar">Paper Mario: Sticker Star</a></em> seperates you from Kersti, your Hammer, and all of your stickers upon falling in a pit of spiders. You must reclaim all of your Stickers, beat a miniboss without the Hammer, save Kersti, find the Hammer, save the Wiggler segment that fell down the hole, then finally reach the goal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>: the Citadel DLC at one point drops you into a firefight with only a level one pistol you just stole from a goon and no armour, allies or medi-gel, which is pretty inconvenient after you fall quite a long distance and get beaten down to only one health box out of five as a scripted event. Of course, you still have all of your powers, which can be astoundingly destructive if you're a power-based class, and the pistol is really quite powerful if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">aim for the head</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar">Lunar: The Silver Star</a></em> has the Crystal Tower dungeon, in which only the Dragonmaster may wield weapons due to a spell. Since no one in your party is a Dragonmaster, you have to rely on your fists and magic to defeat the various monsters within.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> has a number of quests where you're not allowed to bring items with you, as well as quests where you're not allowed to equip anything that isn't a weapon. One notable quest in <em>Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</em>, "Naked and Afraid", is a High-Rank quest where you must fight two Deviljhos, already dangerous enough aggressive monsters on their own, with no armor or Talismans.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RealmsOfArkania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RealmsOfArkania">Realms of Arkania</a></em> trilogy has this happen a few times. Most notably in the <em>final</em> dungeon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when your party is shrunk down in order to fight off magical insects on their own turf</span>.
</li><li> Spirit Crucible Elpys in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em> is a downplayed example. When you start the dungeon, you're told the particles in the air that adsorb <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics">ether</a> to light the place up choke your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Blades</a> of the energy they use to fight, and this is reflected in gameplay. On the upper level, nobody can use level 3 specials anymore, the middle level limits you to level 1 specials, and the lower level prevents you from even reaching full affinity during battle (which prevents a lot of passives kicking in, crippling Blades who would otherwise sail on their normal attacks). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Poppi</a>, who self-produces her own ether internally, is immune to these effects so by fielding Tora you'll have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">at least one fighter immune to all this</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "No One Escapes Cidhna Mine" sidequest, which strips you of all your inventory items (though magic is still available, you're given a pickaxe, and you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals">bargain with your fellow inmates for a shiv</a>). Your stuff is all given back to you at the very end however.
</li><li> Weirdly averted in the main quest when you must infiltrate the Thalmor embassy. A collaborator can smuggle some equipment in for you, and instructs you to bring only what is absolutely necessary, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">there's no weight limit on what he smuggles in</a>, so you can dump your entire inventory on him and pick it up again ten minutes later without ever having to get into a fight.
</li><li> Mastering the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingMagic">Restoration</a> spell requires performing a ritual in which the player character is locked in a small room, stripped of all their gear and clothes, and must survive long enough being attacked by mage ghosts, or outright defeat them.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaidenGame">spin-off</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionAdventure">Action-Adventure</a> game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsAdventuresRedguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsAdventuresRedguard">The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard</a></em> has an instance of this when you are thrown into the catacombs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>:
<ul><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Temple of Trials</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a>. While you get a spear for most of it, at the end you have to go toe to toe with another member of your tribe while unarmed. If you specced for guns or other skills, you'll have a tough time. Granted, since this is <em>Fallout</em>, there's a few ways around it.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">despite losing all your inventory (including your Pip-Boy) when captured after getting a key plot item, you recover all your items <em>from a locker conveniently placed in the room you are held in</em>. You're even instructed by one of your captors (President Eden) to get your stuff from it.</span> The sequence following this event, had it NOT be subverted, would've been a subversion of another fake difficulty trope (before briefly subverting/correcting itself.) Played arrow-straight, however, in <em>The Pitt</em> expansion. In order to get into Pittsburgh, you must (willingly or unwillingly) give up all your equipment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except, optionally, for a hidden switchblade or the least powerful gun in the game — both are only marginally better than your bare hands</span> despite the fact that by this point, you may be kitted out in full Power Armor with a Gatling Laser and the guards are about as strong as the other random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> you've been killing for days.
</li><li> Same deal for the <em>Mothership Zeta</em> expansion. Although you find some really swanky stun sticks almost immediately, and then start finding alien zap guns. It's almost enough to make you not want to bother retrieving the rest of your stuff.
</li><li> Also played straight in the <em>Operation: Anchorage</em> simulation, which starts you off with only a Silenced 10mm Pistol against virtual Chinese soldiers with assault and sniper rifles, and this time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusableEnemyEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusableEnemyEquipment">you can't loot enemy weapons</a> either.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has several of these areas:
<ul><li> In the main game, there are several areas with doormen that will confiscate your weapons before letting you inside (such as casinos on the New Vegas Strip or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caesar's Fort</span>) and hold onto them until you leave. That said, you can smuggle in small holdout weapons (like straight razors, brass knuckles, or small pistols) or large holdout weapons if your sneaking skill is especially good (like large pistols or energy weapons.) Or you can tell the doormen something along the lines of:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>The Courier</strong>: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoWordsAddedEmphasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoWordsAddedEmphasis">Five Words</a>. From. My. Cold. Dead. Hands."
</div><ul><li> Note that saying that is a bad idea if you want to interact with the folks there in a way not involving gunfire.
</li><li> In the <em>Dead Money</em> expansion, you lose all your gear from the start with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> that the Sierra Madre automated security system removes everything with traces of radiation on it and teleports it back to your home. (Oddly enough, this does <em>not</em> include your Pip-Boy.)
</li><li> In the <em>Honest Hearts</em> expansion there's a more reasonable explanation - since you're joining a caravan that will travel through mountainous terrain, you can only carry 75 pounds of gear with you to keep up. (You do get to choose which gear to take with you, however. Also, if you pass a few checks, you can get someone else to carry an additional 25 pounds of gear for you.)
</li><li> During the first leg of the quest "Still in the Dark" (unless you have Veronica as a companion), the Brotherhood of Steel strips you of your inventory as well as fitting you with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveLeash">explosive collar</a>, and only gives you your stuff back after you're back outside of the bunker, moving to deal with an NCR Ranger who's snooping too close.

<ul><li> All the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> games have this in some form.
<ul><li> Reversed somewhat in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear1">Metal Gear</a></em>. In order to rescue Gray Fox, you must trick the guards into capturing <em>you</em>. You then encounter the first boss of the game unarmed, and must complete a short pseudo-puzzle (while dodging the boss's fire) to get back your equipment. You can then shoot the boss with remote-controlled missiles. The kicker is that there's now a transponder in your gear that will summon endless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawningEnemies">Respawning Enemies</a> until you discard it.
</li><li> You also have to lose all your equipment to encounter Gray Fox in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em>, but for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisticuffsBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisticuffsBoss">different reason</a> this time. Fox accomplishes this by <em>setting you on fire</em>, forcing you to go through your inventory and drop all your equipment in order to put the fire out. The final boss afterwards, Big Boss, requires you to go through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockAndKeyPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockAndKeyPuzzle">Lock and Key Puzzle</a>, grabbing higher-security keycards to open higher-level doors and ultimately acquire a spray can and lighter to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerosolFlamethrower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerosolFlamethrower">improvise a flamethrower</a>.

<ul><li> They also hid a <em>time bomb</em> in with the rest of your equipment. If you don't notice the new addition to your inventory and get rid of it before the timer runs out, it explodes and you die.
</li><li> One of the areas you travel through is filled with a bunch of (albeit deactivated) warheads that make firing guns really risky (even if they won't go up, they could leak radiation), so your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> calls to note that your nanomachines are programmed to prevent you from firing guns in that room. Not like it stops the guards from shooting at <em>you</em> if they catch you, though.
</li><li> The final boss must be fought hand-to-hand. The player isn't given any of their weapons back for the escape sequence either, having to rely on a mounted gun on the back of the escape vehicle.

Like in the first <em>MGS</em>, you also have your weapons taken away for the final boss, leaving you nothing but the high-frequency blade he hands you just before it starts for real.

As is common in the series, you have to enact a prison escape without your gear, though it's a little easier than the second and third games thanks to a short length and retaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">CQC</a>. In an interesting variation, you don't get all your items back after escaping. Instead, an Extra Op is unlocked where you must play as MSF soldier(s) to recover some of the items Snake had taken from him when he got captured.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidVThePhantomPain">Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</a></em>'s Subsistence missions force the player to wear Olive Drab camo and have no weapons. Supply drops are also disabled, meaning the only source of weapons and ammunition is within enemy guard posts.
<ul><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">"No Traces" bonus.</a> In order to get this bonus, you cannot use weapons or attack enemies at all (though hold-ups and subsequent interrogations are still allowed).

Both retrieve their gear towards the end of the level. There's also the third level where you need to search the truck for gear, or a psuedo example in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">sewer level</a> where you lose everything but Teresa gives you a .45 at the beginning.
<ul><li> Part 3 has Gabe rescuing hostages and disarming bombs carrying only a pistol while Mara's mooks wear body armor and carry automatics.
</li><li> In the first bonus mission from <em>Omega Strain</em>, you only have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletLeft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletLeft">a single bullet</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingMission">snipe</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">Mafia boss</a> with, so you must use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap">Neck Snap</a> to take out any bodyguards in the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">without being spotted</a>. A couple missions later, your chopper gets shot down in Mazyr, Belarus, leaving you with only your pistol and melee weapon, and you have to find the crash site to retrieve your gear, fighting through much more heavily-armed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a> along the way. In the second bonus mission, also a stealth mission, Lian Xing is undercover and armed only with poisoned shurikens; if a guard gets too close, they will see through her disguise. Then there's the Arms Bazaar in Yemen, another stealth mission that starts you out with just a knife and a civilian disguise, although you get a silenced sniper rifle and night-vision goggles early on. Done yet <em>again</em> in the second Yemen mission, where you have five minutes to stealth kill all the guards in the first room without them sounding the alarm.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefTheDarkProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefTheDarkProject">Thief: The Dark Project</a></em>, Garrett has his gear taken away <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his eye plucked out by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>. Garrett starts the level with no gear at all, but if you have the presence of mind to search <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the room you start in</span> you'll easily find his bow and some other useful items.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefDeadlyShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThiefDeadlyShadows">Thief: Deadly Shadows</a></em>, the trope is played straight if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityGuards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityGuards">City Guards</a> capture you, as they will toss Garrett into prison and you have to break out. This trope is also popular in fan-made missions. The difficulty depends on whether you've been depending on your weapons to get by, or if you've properly honed your stealth skills.
</li></ul></li><li> The last mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCellChaosTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCellChaosTheory">Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</a></em> has a short sequence involving the protagonist's capture in the final level; the area you're sneaking into is patrolled by guards using non-lethal weapons that KO you instead. Not as egregious as the others, as you are not actually thrown in prison, but stripped of your equipment and taken to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">an impromptu interrogation</a>. When the guards enter the adjacent room, the player is given the chance to pick the lock on the handcuffs, allowing you to deal with your captors and retrieve your gear. Also, there is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutsceneIncompetence">Cutscene Incompetence</a> involved; if you're captured, it's because you made a mistake all by yourself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCellDoubleAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCellDoubleAgent">Splinter Cell: Double Agent</a></em> has a couple. The first is fully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> since it involves escaping a maximum-security prison, and the later is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">hand waved</a> with Sam saying "I wish you had given me more warning; I don't have my gear ready."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu">Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven</a></em> averts this, to the point where it seems stupid. At one point in the game, Ayame winds up captured. There is nothing you can do to prevent this, as it (and her eventual escape) is part of the plot. However, between the mission where you are captured, and the mission where you escape, you are allowed to choose your inventory. Even though inventory selection is done at her base of operations. Even assuming that the inventory screen is really just window dressing and not the home base, one wonders how it is that Ayame is able to select any weapon in her entire inventory while she's locked up in prison. Stealing back weapons she had on her when she was captured, OK. Equipping weapons that she left at home before she got captured, though, doesn't make sense.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manhunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manhunt">Manhunt</a></em> frequently removes items after each level. Sometimes it is justified (e.g. bad guys in dark clothing jump Cash and take his stuff), other times discarded without discussion (e.g. when starting the journalist escort scene).
</li><li> Happens twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Commandos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Commandos">Commandos</a> 2</em> and once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Commandos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Commandos">Commandos</a> 3</em>.

Completing mastery challenges unlocks ICA dead drops, and reaching level 20 finally unlocks your gear slots again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dishonored">Dishonored</a></em> takes away all your equipment at the beginning of the Flooded District level.

You have to break out the box and fight your way through hordes of cultists, armed with only a step-ladder (until you find the katana on a shelf). Notably, you can avoid this by defeating them at distance and thus avoiding their gas attack. This is rather difficult in most cases, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity Plus One</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Buster</a> renders it laughably easy. And when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Army shows up near the end</span>, they will capture you if you "die." They strip you to your boxers and tie you up. Oddly though, even though they are there <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to cover up the incident</span>, they take your pants <em>but not your camera.</em>

The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">extremely efficient</a></em> air taser that it was easy to rely on as the primary weapon through the entire game.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em>, you're required to use an elevator that can hold one person. And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalevolentArchitecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalevolentArchitecture">only</a></em> one person. You have to drop all your weapons and health items, ride the elevator down, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore">work your way back to your possessions</a>.

Thankfully, a quick look around the area turns up the combat knife and a basic pistol. Find an optional semi-hidden key and you'll gain access to the locker room, where all your items are conveniently stashed.
</li><li> Every time you nearly fall to your death and have to climb up to safety in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour">Silent Hill: Downpour</a></em>, you'll reach the top with <em>none</em> of your weapons, items, or even first aid kits. You don't get your lost gear back, either; this is the game's sneaky way of keeping you from hoarding your items.
</li><li> The first third of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfCthulhuDarkCornersOfTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfCthulhuDarkCornersOfTheEarth">Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth</a></em> is played like this, and after that you still lose all your weapons in several occasions to retain the horror feel. Once you're strangely quickly given a pistol, even though the only monster in the level is utterly immune to bullets, and in other time you're reduced to a pistol, even though you would think that being sent to help a party of soldiers would call for <em>more</em> arsenal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake">Alan Wake</a></em> has the annoying habit of dropping all of his weapons, lights and ammo in between the chapters. Sometimes even in the same chapter due to cutscene stupidity. One part of the game forces you to navigate an area <em>filled</em> with bear traps without any weapons, and getting caught in a trap spawns an enemy that you can't kill due to your lack of weapons. If you get caught in one, you're bound to get caught in another since you now have to flee from the enemy chasing you instead of taking it slow and careful, which means there are now <em>two</em> enemies chasing you, and it continues to spiral downhill from there.

Worse, the very next puzzle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">can lock you</a> with a ghost that is supposedly trivial to defeat, if only Mio has her camera.]]

It is justified since Sherry doesn't use weapons and thankfully, the sections with Sherry are short, have enemies that you can dodge, and she has almost double the amount of defense compared to Claire.
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em> also has the no-gear level where you play as Sherry, but rather than dodging enemies she has to play Cat and Mouse with the repulsive murderous potential rapist that is Police Chief Irons in a creepy orphanage, complete with a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">HERE'S JOHNNY!</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> where Irons smashes through a window.

To make matters worse, there are monsters roaming around with huge axes that have to be lured into traps in order to kill them off.

After they escape when monsters wreck the van they were in, they must defend themselves with only a flare gun (which is actually a very handy weapon when fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakenedByTheLight">darkness monsters</a>) and a baseball bat. They recover <em>most</em> of their weapons before facing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>.

<ul><li> Also happens several times to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverythingOrNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverythingOrNothing">Everything or Nothing</a></em>. Quite frankly, you end up wondering why they even bother to take his weapons at all, when there are so many unlocked armouries for Bond to take his pick from. In general, Bond is infamous for this, because the enemies never take away his gadgets.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DestroyAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DestroyAllHumans">Destroy All Humans!</a></em>, when Crypto's craft gets shot down in Union Town and he gets caught by Majestic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni">Oni</a></em>, pretty much the whole <em>game</em> is like this. In the levels where you start with a weapon at all, you start with the pistol (and sometimes, a hypo). Otherwise, you start each level with no weapon, ammunition, or hypos... even when the level transition is (as in one particular case) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectContinuousLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectContinuousLevels">''walking through a door, into another room''</a>. Good thing the hand-to-hand combat is so reliable...
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em> games do this:
<ul><li> In the original game, after getting the crap beaten out of him by Frankie "the Bat" Niagara, Max has to sneak past Frankie's men until he can get his weapons back. In order to illustrate the badass nature of Max Payne, it's important to reiterate the point: after getting <em>pummeled with a baseball bat to the point of death</em>, Max Payne had to escape being tied to a chair, grab the bat that had been used to whack the bejeezus out of him, use it to whack the mooks and get their guns, then go to town. It is also possible to get the mooks to shoot at each other, and finish off the remaining ones, like anyone would do in a weaponless level. Also, if you wait and observe their pattern, it is possible to get out of the basement without alerting any guards and also raiding a supply room for almost all the weapons you had lost.
</li><li> In <em>Max Payne 2</em>, he has to evade assassins at the hospital until he can obtain a weapon from a fallen security guard and turn the tables. He also loses everything at the start of the second chapter... then the police station gets attacked.
</li><li> <em>Max Payne 3</em> pulls this at the beginning of the third chapter where Max is forced to disarm. To add insult to injury, he gets shot in the arm by a sniper, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">crippling his mobility</a> and causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpairmentShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpairmentShot">vision blur and periodic blackouts</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The N64 - game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem">Duke Nukem</a>: Zero Hour</em>. In the first level of the wild west episode Duke gets wrongly accused of a bank robbery and held at gunpoint by two female marshals. Of course, there's this whole alien invasion going on, but the law's the law. Duke quips how it would be a shame to shoot "the women folk", and being a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">well-known gentleman</a></em> lets them arrest him. You start the next level in a jail cell with all your equipment gone.
</li><li> Again, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> The segment where you play as Ashley in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> amounts to this. Ashley can fight back by throwing lanterns at enemies, but that's about it.
</li><li> At one point in the Lost in Nightmares DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>, Jill and Chris fall down a shaft and lose all of their equipment. After the fall, you're forced to wander through a labyrinth that has several enemies with the large axe. You have to use the traps that are dotted around the area to kill them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em>, Jake and Sherry are captured and stripped of all their gear at the beginning of Chapter 3. Thankfully, for those who chose to play as Jake, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">his bare hands tend to do more damage than his guns anyways</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher's Bay</em> has more No Gear Levels than normal ones. Most guards have guns you can't use, so you go around meleeing everybody. Every now and then the game lets you grab a non-DNA-coded gun you can actually use, only to remove it from you a short while later.
</li><li> Every station in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion</a></em> has an Equipper that allows you to select a weapon loadout for that mission. However, some stations only have one available loadout - no weapons at all. These stages usually require you to find more creative means of reaching the goal, such as using cannons, finding canned weapons, or simply dodging enemy fire until a time limit runs out.
<ul><li> The final area of the Expansion starts out like this because there <em>isn't</em> an Equipper, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you are now going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a> and escaping from the facility. The first phase of the escape is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a> where you need to sneak past the Sanitized Octarians guarding the facility. Eventually, you find Splat Bombs and an Octo Shot, which let you fight your way to the surface.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">    Turn-Based Strategy </div><div class="folder" id="folder21" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> At the end of the Life Missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic IV</a></em>, you get to keep your items but are stripped of your entire army, to fight the final end boss with just the story's main character. The enemy however, is also a lone general, who's probably lower level and has no ranks in Combat, so you can generally trounce him.
</li><li> At the end of the third chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em>, Leaf and Lifis are thrown into jail along with Karin and Fergus ; all of them have had their equipment stripped away from them and put into chests scattered around the prison. You have to use your three new recruits with weapons (Brighton, Machyua and Lara) to get them out of their cells and to help them recover their equipment quickly, since the game mechanics allow any disarmed unit to be captured instantly.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed Trope</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em> expansion Enemy Within. A group of human terrorists called EXALT are out to hinder XCOM's operation as much as they can. Neutralizing them involves locating some of their cells, and sending a covert operative to investigate them. Covert operatives cannot bring armor and main weapons on their missions, only items and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handgun">handgun</a>. Six days later, they get the information, but their cover is blown, forcing you to send a squad to rescue your operative, or he/she will get KIA and the intelligence will be lost. While your squad can pack as much heat as you can afford, your covert operative will have to survive with limited gear and being separated from your squad.
</li><li> A variant is done with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>'s two DLC mini-campaigns. "Edy Detachment Challenge" forces you to use specific units, who are all reset to a predetermined level and with a predetermined loadout, both of which are almost guaranteed to be weaker then what you have in the main campaign. Meanwhile, "Behind Her Blue Flame" gives you control of Selvaria in all her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">overpowered glory</a>, but also forces her to drag along a team of mediocre Imperial units who haven't even reached Elite status.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder22');">    Wide Open Sandbox </div><div class="folder" id="folder22" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series has multiple instances of this:
<ul><li> In order to complete the "Penal Ties" mission in the Residential district of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto2">Grand Theft Auto 2</a></em>, you have to get arrested, and thereby get stripped of all your weapons.
</li><li> The last story mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em> sees you stripped of the possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">thousands-of-pounds of weaponry and ammunition you might be carrying</a> in the opening cutscene before you punch out a guard and steal his pistol. The rest of the mission requires you to keep pace with your fleeing ex-girlfriend turned crime lord while properly re-arming yourself to stay alive and eventually shoot down the helicopter she's escaping in. If the player finds many of the packages and is swift with a vehicle, it is possible to swing by a safehouse and load up on the goodies.
</li><li> In general, the installments from <em>Vice City</em> on, on account of having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedLoadout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedLoadout">Limited Loadout</a> you can swap out for different guns, will often take your stronger weapons and replace them with weaker ones as a story necessity, thereby cheating you out of your hard-earned equipment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoViceCity">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a></em>, Tommy is asked to <em>persuade</em> someone to part with some land by going to the country club and beating the crap out of him. There's a metal detector at the entrance which places all your weapons outside (you can pick them up again when you leave) — but this trope is subverted because it is possible to jump over the outside wall and enter the country club with all your equipment. The metal detector only takes away your guns and grenades, though. Entering with a chainsaw is perfectly fine. This happens in the airport terminal, too, and you can't get around that one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>, CJ loses all his guns several times. After you've finished the story missions for the first city, you're dumped out of town with no weapons. Later on, after the helicopter he's gunning down from gets shot down and crashes in water, you must then make your way aboard the gangster-ridden container ship you were attacking and acquire guns by killing gang members with your knife. (Or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you can simply swim ashore, buy new weapons, and go back</span>). Another mission, Stowaway, has CJ inside a plane loaded with explosives (possibly landmines). Shooting in there is not forbidden, no - but one shot that misses a government agent mook in there means hitting the explosives and the whole thing goes kaboom. Players are likely to resort to melee weapons or unarmed combat in there, risking no such thing - especially since getting into the plane in the first place is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level Part</a> players are unlikely to want to repeat. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23mi8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23mi8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23mi8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Driving up to and then up a narrow ramp of said plane, while it's taking off, on a motorbike, and with barrels rolling out of the ramp every once in a while. And the plane has quite a lot of head start...</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>, a few of Michael's missions are like this.
<ul><li> "Dead Man Walking" has Michael loaded into a morgue, stripped of his weapons. You acquire a pistol by steathily knocking out a government spook and use it to fight through more spooks. Thankfully, you're able to regain your arsenal later on, and Dave, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> for the mission, notifies you about it.
</li><li> "Bury The Hatchet" has Michael in North Yankton with only a pistol, the justification being that his weapons were removed on the flight. You have to face a group of Triads equipped with shotguns and assault rifles using only your pistol... which would've been problematic were it not for Michael's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a> special ability.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours">Scarface: The World Is Yours</a></em> does this in the mission where Tony returns to Freedomtown, confiscating his weapons and springing an ambush on him. It also does... something like this at the start of the assault on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, dropping all the stuff in Tony's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a> for a Desert Eagle and rather limited ammo. You have to collect guns off fallen enemies to keep fighting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> has you drop all of your items upon death, which means you're forced to endure the game without any weapons or tools when you respawn unless you are quick enough to get back to where you died or had stored extra items away in a chest. Many custom maps that take advantage of Command Blocks can also strip you of all your items if the block is programmed to do so.
<ul><li> Can be subverted, though, as the game does include a command line prompt that prevents this (and also lets you keep all your XP when you respawn). Again, use of Command Blocks can also enable this ability.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> has a level where JC Denton is captured, stripped of his gear, and must escape.
</li><li> The Director's Cut version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em> has "The Missing Link" expansion (re-)integrated into the main game, turning an instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Bag of Spilling</a> into this. In an unusual example, while the player's <em>weapons</em> are recoverable early on in the level, <em>ammunition</em> for the more powerful ones is scarce, if not nonexistent, until the player recovers the rest of their gear at the end. As a further complication, the player does not get their lost Praxis points back until the end of the level, so some hard choices may have to be made between retaining a powerful - but currently unusable - weapon, and sinking a signifiant portion of their limited number of Praxis points into inventory space, when other augmentations are more urgently needed.
</li><li> While it's not all your gear, or even most of it, a portion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathStranding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathStranding">Death Stranding</a></em> makes you forego your BB, rendering the BTs completely invisible to you and not only restricting your ability to explore but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">from advancing too far west</a> until you get it back.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder23');">    Miscellaneous Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder23" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the story mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's Stardust Accelerator</a></em>, the player gets sent to jail after breaking into Neo Domino City, duel runner and cards confiscated in the process. While you use borrowed cards to win your freedom, it takes a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a> to get your stuff back.
</li><li> While your weapons are bolted onto the ship and cannot be removed, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NavalOps">Warship Gunner 2</a></em> has one mission where your ship has expended all of its ammunition and needs to resupply by taking over an enemy depot (presumably with a contingent of marines). Fortunately, the only opposition comes from coastal defense guns that are more annoying than anything else.
</li><li> In the final four races of the 6th-gen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TestDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TestDrive">Test Drive</a></em> reboot, the game takes away all your previous cars and has you race an ancient Ford GT-40 against a Dodge Viper Competition Coupe.
</li><li> In several levels of the <em>Driver</em> series, e.g., "The President's Run" and "Chase the Gunman", you are given a slow, clunky car and forced to flee from or chase much faster opponents.
</li><li> Happens bizarrely enough in <em>Tony Hawk's Underground</em>, where you surrender your skateboard to go and get your friend's skateboard back from a bunch of drug dealers. Essentially this is an excuse to give you a tutorial on the off foot mechanic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRidersZeroGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRidersZeroGravity">Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity</a></em> does this literally in three missions in Mission Mode. In these missions, your character(Amy in one, Storm in the next and Jet in the last) is locked into their on-foot Charge mode and are tasked with fighting off an army of robots. While Charge mode allows them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">reach speeds far higher than they do on their boards,</a> the way the stages are set up for the mission and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">the skill and speed that the enemy AI have in evading you</a> means that you HAVE to be running for as much time as possible to hit all of them, meaning that outside of trick ramps, your Gravity Control and Gear Parts are absolutely useless.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOTheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOTheLordOfTheRings">LEGO The Lord of the Rings</a>, in keeping with the movie, you can't go before Theoden King so armed, by order of Grima Wormtongue. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have to fight guards with their bare hands or with conveniently placed candlesticks. Thankfully, Gandalf has his staff and if you heal Theoden quickly you won't be without your gear for very long.
