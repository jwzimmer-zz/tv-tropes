<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"Diplomatic immunity!"</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Arjen Rudd</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon2">Lethal Weapon 2</a></em>
</div></div><p>
</p><p>The 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations is a treaty between countries which generally grants to the official representative of a country certain privileges by the receiving country, on the presumption of reciprocity, e.g. we will grant immunity from prosecution to your official diplomats in our country as long as you do the same for ours when they're in your country.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Diplomatic immunity, the next step in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger">not shooting the messenger</a>" etiquette, is supposed to protect diplomats from being harassed for political reasons. In fiction, this can be a handy device, as it answers the question of "why don't they just arrest him?" quite neatly. Quite often, it's the villains who are protected by it  their immunity from the cops means that it's left to the hero to bring them down vigilante-style. Visiting heads of state get something similar, so every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President Evil</a> presumably has it automatically, although it isn't necessarily included in the plot. There are also heroes who have it, but for them, it's often a rather flimsy shield.
</p><p>Related to this is the principle that the grounds of embassies should be treated (only <em>treated</em>, mind) as part of the owning country for legal purposes. This provides characters with a place to retreat to where they will supposedly be safe from pursuit  again, they're often villains who will smugly inform the hero that they can't follow. Likewise the immunity of sealed "Diplomatic Bags" from customs searches may be used by a diplomatic villain as an easy way to smuggle illegal items<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0000g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0000g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0000g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Diplomatic couriers are stationed in just about every embassy in the world, and the courier bags they carry cannot, by law, be searched or even handled by anyone else. However, in practice, if the courier doesn't have the bag on their person or in easy reach, well, who's going to know? Diplomatic couriers can't be detained while on business, but accidents <em>can</em> happen</span>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>And then there are cars with diplomatic plates, which are supposedly immune to all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTroubleWithTickets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTroubleWithTickets">traffic and parking regulations</a>. In reality, while it's perfectly possible to issue them a ticket, it's difficult at best to make them actually pay the fine. Some countries, surprisingly enough, <em>do</em> pay their parking tickets when official vehicles are ticketed.
</p><p>Diplomatic immunity only applies to recognized diplomats and specific portions of their families; agents not officially in the country ("Non official cover" or hidden spies) can't claim it. Committing major crimes under the cover of diplomatic immunity would cause a serious international incident. Take murder, for example. If a foreign country protects a diplomat accused of murder from all consequences, they would appear to approve of the murder, making it an assassination by that country, which is an act of war. While diplomatic immunity is abused, serious abuse is playing with fire so diplomatic immunity can be revoked by the issuing country's foreign affairs office <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon2">or by shooting the diplomat in the head</a>... whichever comes first.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In real life, it's never taken that seriously, primarily because abusing diplomatic privileges to commit serious felonies in the host country is a very good way of getting the host country very, <em>very</em> angry, leading in turn to all kinds of potentially unpleasant international diplomatic consequences should you get caught. If a diplomat did something really bad in the host country, either the sending country would strip them of their immunity allowing the host country to try them, or, if they won't, the host country will declare them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata">Persona Non Grata</a> (PNG), a fancy Latin term roughly equivalent to "you're being a horrible guest, get out of our country" meaning they either have to leave the country within a reasonable time, or they have to give up their diplomatic immunity and be an ordinary tourist (at which point they could be prosecuted). In some cases, if the sending country is going to prosecute them instead, they will recall the person back to the home country, often before the host country PNGs them.
</p><p>The accuracy of depictions varies considerably. Abuse of it on-screen can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">Hollywood Law</a>.
</p><p>This is often used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHarmRequirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHarmRequirement">No-Harm Requirement</a> to keep the heroes from taking down a bad guy easily.

<ul><li> In one episode a hacker tries to defend himself from Section 9 by saying that he's the son of the Canadian ambassador. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is, but Section 9 had already sought and received consent from the Canadians to proceed. Much of the episode takes place with Section 9 tailing him until the proper authorizations are given allowing them to move in for the arrest.</span>
</li><li> In another case, a Russian criminal who's been trafficking in humans happens to have unwittingly kidnapped the daughter of the former Japanese Prime Minister. Said criminal tries to run to the embassy but they close the automatic gates on her before she has a chance to get in.
</li><li> At the climax of the second season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> takes a job with the American Empire, complete with extradition, in order to give himself a quasi-form of this. Section 9 obtains a letter from the Prime Minister authorizing them to use any means necessary up to and including lethal force to prevent his defection, despite the risk of a diplomatic backlash. When confronted, he assumes they are bluffing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadASplode">They aren't.</a> </span>
</li></ul></li><li> At the start of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> movie Section 9 was going after someone who then claimed diplomatic immunity. The Major simply blew his head off.
</li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> R2</em>, the Black Knights take refuge in the Chinese Federation's embassy (having Geassed the ambassador into submission).
</li><li> In the Fujiyama Gangsta Paradise arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafiya">Balalaika</a> essentially gets away with creating a yakuza civil war by pulling a few strings and getting the Russian Ambassador to escort her away from her last hit and away from a huge police dragnet, who don't know who she is apart from the fact that an Ambassador just came to pick her up. Interestingly, someone who does know who she is yells at the cops for failing to arrest her, meaning that she didn't actually have this trope in effect but was only counting on them expecting it just long enough for her to make an escape.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UntilDeathDoUsPart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UntilDeathDoUsPart">Until Death Do Us Part</a></em>, bad guy Edge Turus invokes this against Mamoru. It doesn't work, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and he ends up losing an arm and a leg</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em>, Sakutaro has this as a superpower.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LevelE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LevelE">Level E</a></em>. Prince Baka Ki El Dogra is an enormous jerk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">and knows it</a>, but no one can do anything about him because he <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">a prince</a>, and by the way of a recently concluded diplomatic treaty (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">he orchestrated</a> in a first part) he is in effect a protector of the Earth. He still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">gets beaten a lot</a> though.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DominionTankPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DominionTankPolice">Dominion Tank Police</a></em> OVA series, Leona discovers the identity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the season and is told to back off because he's a diplomat. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Instead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">she follows him to the airport in her tank and shoots his plane down as he's taking off.</a> There are no mentioned repercussions for this outright act of war whatsoever.</span>
</li><li> The World Nobles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> combine this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">Screw the Rules, I Make Them!</a>. As they are the descendants of the people who founded the (highly corrupt) World Government, they can do as they please, and anyone who even tries to interfere with or touch them in any way will face the full force of a Marine army, including an admiral. Arguably the only people in the world who could get away with defying or even killing a World Noble are the Four Emperors, certain members of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, or the most wanted man in the world, Dragon the Revolutionary, because between their powerful crews and personal strength, even the admirals would have a hard time defeating one of <em>them</em>.
</li><li> The final arc of the original run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Appleseed">Appleseed</a></em> involved a cyborg diplomat trying to use this to smuggle a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> out of the city, by <em>wiring himself into it</em> and <em>walking</em> out. Unfortunately for him, his immunity got revoked, and he discovered that Giant Robots are somewhat vulnerable to flying cyborgs with tank cannons.
</li><li> Used and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CatPlanetCuties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CatPlanetCuties">Cat Planet Cuties</a></em>.
<ul><li> Aoi and Manami are given diplomatic protection by the Catians after they helped rescue Eris from the CIA. This prevents retaliation against them for that act, but the protection is never used to allow them to commit further crimes. The Japanese government was happy to do so since the Catians were willing to overlook the fact that the member they'd sent to make initial contact with Earth had been kidnapped and nearly murdered on Japanese soil.
</li><li> The potential diplomatic immunity of Kio's house being the Catian embassy is brought up in two instances later. Once, when Eris wants to mate with Kio despite being underage by Japanese law, and another time when Manami wants to shoot off guns in the yard. Both times, Kio puts the kibosh on it because he's not okay with either.
</li></ul></li><li> A one-shot character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CatsEye">Cat's Eye</a></em> was a foreign ambassador using his immunity to steal and smuggle art, with Toshio and the other cops having managed to follow the trail to him and gather enough evidence they would be able to search his house if it wasn't an embassy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">The ambassador's country revokes the immunity for him and his accomplices when Toshio manages to gather damning evidence anyway</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGoodbyePartner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIGoodbyePartner">Lupin III: Goodbye Partner</a></em>, the villainous Roy Forest is forced to bail out of his private jet over the ocean thanks to Lupin. Floating in his escape pod, he tries to claim diplomatic immunity thanks to his connections to the American government when Inspector Zenigata comes to arrest him. Zenigata points out that Lupin cleverly arranged for Forest's plane to crash in international waters, which means he's now in ICPO territory <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">where there is no diplomatic immunity</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a>, as ruler of Latveria, enjoys the head-of-state version when on official visits, but he's fair game when visiting on other occasions.
<ul><li> In the Crossover story where he fought Superman, after his plan was defeated Doom ran to the Latverian embassy, reaching it seconds before Superman arrived, then simply turned toward Superman and dared him to cross the embassy border to try arresting him on Latverian soil. Superman didn't want to trigger a major diplomatic incident so he turned around and left.
</li><li> In one Fantastic Four story, Reed Richards and his family go to Latveria and take it over briefly so they can dismantle Doom's assets while he's suffering from a temporary death. They're eventually challenged by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> and arrested due to breaking international law by occupying the country, regardless of the fact that they're removing the tools Doom used to oppress the populace. Eventually it's pointed out to Fury that in addition to being a murderous tyrant, Dr. Doom broke international law and committed horrible crimes just about every other day on both his own and foreign soil, yet somehow neither the United Nations or any authority ever revoked his diplomatic immunity or attempted to remove him from power. This has never been brought up again.
</li><li> The first storyline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers">Mighty Avengers</a></em> had Iron Man march his team of Avengers right into Latveria, fight and arrest Doom for something he didn't even start (a symbiote invasion - he had a satellite that started it, but he didn't initiate it). He promptly escaped during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em> and wasn't touched since.
</li><li> Should be noted that while Latveria is a tiny fictional country and normally would lack any amount of real political clout, the fact that Doom is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUbermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUbermensch">Ubermenschen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence">super-genius</a> means that he was able to turn it into a <em>de facto</em> global superpower on par with or even <em>surpassing</em> the United State of America, having access to technology so advanced that in the event of a war between the two Latveria would almost certainly win; Doom himself is powerful enough to let him take on an entire team of superheroes by himself, not to mention he has teleportation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> tech on his person <em>and</em> in his embassy so can enter and leave the United States at any time.

</li><li> Miles and Mark both have real, and apparently legally effective (though details are unclear), diplomatic immunity, being the sons of the Prime Minister of Barrayar (formerly Regent, later Viceroy of Sergyar), who is also a Count in his own right (and therefore a minor head of state) as well as the arguable<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lk1t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1lk1t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lk1t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">All of the Vorkosigans would argue <em>against</em> this legal theory</span> successor to the Emperor.

</li><li> Miles also presumably has immunity in his own right once he's appointed Imperial Auditor, being, effectively, hatchet man for the Emperor with full Imperial authority.
</li><li> Also, in <em>A Civil Campaign</em>, we learn that statements such as "I want to arrest a Vorkosigan" have the effect of producing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">"the most damn-all stone wall obtuseness from every Barrayaran clerk, secretary, embassy officer and bureaucrat."</a> And that a Count's official residence in the capital is effectively his district's embassy, adding another layer of legal complications to anyone trying to do something to key retainers of a Count.

The ambassador, on hearing what he's been up to (child trafficking), chews him out and then tells the police to go ahead and arrest him.

The Magistrate is quite pissed and lays every single fine he can think of, which is enough to bankrupt a regular family. Joren, however, is filthy rich even by the standards of nobility and he knows that since he didn't perform the physical crime and the victim is a commoner he can't be jailed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode">The Da Vinci Code</a></em>, the main character is told to flee the Parisian police by fleeing to the US embassy so he can have a chance of a fair trial, rather than being the scapegoat for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the museum curator's murder</span>.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe">Nero Wolfe</a> short story "Immune to Murder" (also one of the episodes in the TV series) the murderer is this.
</li><li> A short story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSheckley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSheckley">Robert Sheckley</a> is called "Diplomatic Immunity". It takes the concept rather more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">literally</a> than usual.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexCross">Alex Cross</a></em> novel <em>Pop Goes the Weasel</em>, Geoffrey Shafer is a British diplomat who (and ex-Special Forces assassin) abuses this to get away with murder. Although his government eventually waives the immunity and allows him to be put on trial, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his assertion of the immunity during his arrest leads to the most damning evidence being suppressed, and he is acquitted</span>.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, when the Mouth of Sauron comes to bring Frodo's vest to Gandalf. He explicitly states that "I am an herald and ambassador and may not be assailed!" when he feels that the atmosphere is getting a bit hostile. Gandalf pointedly informs him that where such laws hold true it's customary to behave more politely, which does lead to him dialling back the insults a bit. Of course, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a>, the Mouth does not assert this, and Aragorn promptly lops the guy's head off when he's said his piece.

</li><li> Spies operating under diplomatic cover appear regularly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a>'s novels. Those spies who don't have a diplomatic cover tend to forward their information to those who do, who can then transport that information back to their home country in a diplomatic bag (which cannot be searched by customs agents). In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackRyan">Jack Ryan</a> universe, there's actually only two books that has the good-guy spies operating under official cover (<em>The Cardinal of the Kremlin</em> and <em>Red Rabbit</em>, and in both cases it's the same characters). In all the other books, while official spies do occasionally show up on the bad-guy side, the good guys are always operating under a non-official cover, and the books tend to go to great lengths to show a) how hard their life is, and b) how much <em>easier</em> it would be if they could just go to their embassy sometimes, and not have to worry about getting arrested and killed.

The book <em>Vendetta</em> reveals the driver's name to be John Chai, the son of the Chinese ambassador to the USA Chai Ming. John is apparently quite the playboy and his father tries to keep him penned in to protect the family's honour and reputation. Apparently, John has not gone back to the USA because he knows that he will be arrested and charged for his crime. The Vigilantes had to sneak into China, get John to go somewhere away from security, kidnap him, skin him alive, drop him off to England for treatment and then dump him back in China.

Stephen is on the verge of getting arrested by the local authorities and claims to have diplomatic immunity. The officers don't buy it and demand to "see some diplomatic identification", at which point Stephen throws them a blank plastic card. The whole thing was just a diversion to slow the officers down while his team took them out. It also creates a small amount of confusion for them since the near future setting has it that diplomatic immunity is largely obsolete, and the relevence of asserting it is vaguely defined.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederickForsyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederickForsyth">Frederick Forsyth</a>'s book <em>Fist of God</em>, the main character is being sent into Baghdad during the first Gulf War to gather intelligence from an asset there. Because of the danger to him if he is caught by the AMAM (the Iraqi version of the KGB), he requests that he be attached to a diplomatic household to help protect him if he is caught. Several of his other books portray spies as using diplomat immunity to avoid serious danger to themselves.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LisaShearin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LisaShearin">Lisa Shearin</a>'s Raine Benares novels feature numerous counts of people with diplomatic status using that status to prevent themselves from being prosecuted for various crimes, usually murder, kidnapping, and extortion. Given that the authorities of the good guys know exactly who's doing what, and usually have witnesses/evidence to the fact, you'd think that they'd declare the people in question Persona Non Grata and throw them out of the city, but the notion never even comes up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> discusses Al Neri's background as an NYPD policeman before joining the Corleone Family.

The White Council risks starting a war with Queen Mab if they try any underhanded means of getting Molly, and only if Queen Mab herself agrees to give her over under the Unseelie Accords (the supernatural version of the Vienna Convention among other things) can the council touch her. And Mab will not let that happen.</span> Harry notes that it is <em>a</em> solution, but also points out that it's not a <em>good</em> solution for anyone but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mab</span>.

However, we have the gravest doubt, to make a considerable understatement, that this person who calls himself Benjamin Bathurst is any such envoy, and we do not think that it would be any service to the government of His Britannic Majesty to allow an impostor to travel about Europe in the guise of a British diplomatic representative.

This sneakiness ends up backfiring on them; having been denied the right to have their own police guard their diplomats, they've smuggled in explosives to try and embarrass the British police as well — unfortunately for them, they get caught, and the British police are <em>allowed</em> to arrest them for that.

<ul><li> In one episode of L&amp;O, a diplomat who refused to turn over records to the D.A.'s Office had his car towed. He protested that he had immunity from all parking fines. Jamie Ross argued that while that may be true, they could tow his car for illegal parking at every occurrence, and would until he cooperated. Presumably giving up the evidence was less hassle than finding a legal parking spot (this is a real issue with diplomats at the UN in New York City-while they can't get fined over illegal parking, cars <em>are</em> towed over it, diplomatic plates or not).

His embassy revoked it, but then reinstated it halfway though the trial, allowing him to flee back to his native land. When a furious Ben Stone demands an explanation, he's informed that the man will be tried in a Nigerian court for his crimes, where the penalties for drug smuggling are even <em>tougher</em> than in the U.S. (death by hanging, it was said) and his conviction is all-but-assured thanks to the evidence the Manhattan prosecutors had on him. Stone is still displeased at having been a pawn in the affair, but lets the matter drop relatively quietly.

</li><li> The L&amp;O mothership episode "Rapture" had a man using the tensions between Iran, Israel, and the United States to embezzle from charities and their donors. He tried to claim diplomatic immunity with the Iranian embassy by claiming he was a victim of a Zionist conspiracy. The detectives turned this back on him by making it look like he was <em>part</em> of the conspiracy, causing the government to revoke the immunity and kick him out of the embassy (specifically, the car meant to take him to the airport), where he was promptly arrested by the detectives.
</li><li> One episode had a Russian national flee into a Russian consulate to avoid prosecution (over human trafficking). The Russians gave him up when the DAs gave them another Russian criminal for trial in the motherland.

Deconstructed in that, while the judge does resentfully dismiss the case, the murderer is immediately escorted out of the courthouse by Federal agents and put on the first plane to Croatia.

It's then subverted by the fact that the immunity only applies to <em>foreign</em> prosecution — they can still hand the evidence over to the murderer's own government and let them try the case. Unfortunately for the diplomat in question, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">individuals don't have the authority to waive their own immunity short of defecting</a></span>. In addition, Booth's original plan to have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the diplomat's son</span> declared <strong>persona non grata</strong> wouldn't have let him prosecute, either — at best it would have gotten him recalled to his home country.
</li><li> In another episode, it also turns out that the perpetrator is supposedly covered by diplomatic immunity due to being Egyptian, yet there's no mention of him actually being a <em>diplomat</em>. Somehow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">all Egyptian tourists are diplomats</a>, to judge by the episode's logic.
<ul><li> Though in this case, they don't really cite that it's diplomatic immunity. He's a super computer hacker who managed to erase all traces of his identity and create himself a new one, which happened to be an Egyptian citizen. The implication might have been that he'd simply tricked the system into thinking he was a victim of mistaken identity, which prompted the Egyptian government to try to protect one of their citizens from foreign harassment. They don't really specify. Caroline just says "He's an Egyptian citizen and we can't touch him."

He's about to pull the 'I'm leaving the country and you'll never see me again' trick when Beckett arrests his driver for double-parking, which enables her to both detain him and search his car (which is from a car service, not a diplomatic service, and as such isn't covered under the immunity).
</li><li> Subverted in "Suicide Squeeze", which involves the Cuban consulate in New York. A murder suspect tries hiding out there, but Beckett bluntly informs the head guy that a consulate is not an embassy and as such isn't covered by immunity in these situations; unless she's turned over, there's nothing stopping the police from entering the consulate legally as they would any other similar situation. Since holding her wouldn't reflect well on the Cuban government, she's turned over.

When Ed shows up trying to stop the guy before he boards his private plane the cops just let him go on with his business by citing his personal immunity, in spite of the fact that letting a foreigner steal a national treasure would undoubtedly lead to an international incident with Egypt (which unlike Syria, has been a major US ally since 1989). However, the guy who stole the treasure was a selfish dick who simply did not give a crap who wanted it for his private collection, Deline didn't have any legally obtained, actionable evidence of the crime, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Team Montecito had already stolen it back.</span>

The immortal wanted justice,and ultimately killed the father thinking he did it.

Cagney &amp; Lacey have a warrant for his arrest, but even though he doesn't have immunity, since he is within the diplomatic mission, the Charge dAffairs informs them that they are within their rights to refuse. He reminds them how their own country was horribly upset when the government of Iran didn't respect the sovereignty of their embassy in Tehran. He sneaks out of the mission once (which means he's now fair game) and they almost catch him, but he's able to sneak back in. The two discover that to get rid of a diplomatic incident the United States is going to waive prosecution on the guy. Before he finds out, the two go see him on the mission grounds and make a deal with him: if he'll pay the guy's medical expenses and lost wages, and make a donation to a charity, they'll not prosecute. (The interesting thing is that it was just an accident, if he hadn't panicked and ran, that's probably all that would have happened, his insurance would have had to pay the costs.)

In "Nisei" Mulder and Scully arrest a Japanese consular official after he attacks Mulder while fleeing a crime scene, but is released at A.D. Skinner's order through "diplomatic immunity." The sixth season episode "S.R. 819" repeats this scenario almost verbatim with a Tunisian "diplomat." Justified in-universe as both men implicitly have Syndicate connections.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em> put a twist on it. The diplomat in question claimed immunity, but didn't like the idea of leaving America, something he'd have to do to <em>keep</em> getting away with it. (America clearly had more creature comforts.) Eventually, he paid the fines he owed out of faux compassion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Benson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Benson">Benson</a></em> there was an episode with a wealthy Arabian prince who used his status to pretty much get away with everything, including purposely wrecking Benson's car after they had an argument. Benson decided to teach him a lesson by making him the <em>victim</em> of such vandalism, by convincing Clayton to pose as another diplomat and destroy a work of art the guy owned. (The prince was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">so impressed by Benson's cleverness</a>, he offered to buy him <em>two</em> new cars.)
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">The Good Wife</a></em> involved a brutal rape/murder where the top two suspects were the sons of diplomats. The DA's office determined that while the son of a Dutch diplomat could not be prosecuted due to diplomatic immunity, the other one was Taiwanese, therefore not from a recognized country and did not have it. The protagonist then defended the son of the Taiwanese diplomat trying to prove the immune Dutchman was responsible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But it turns out he was guilty after all.</span>

A Hollander's mother was facing deportation from the US, and he could not afford to travel from Holland. A Holland diplomat hired the woman as a secretary, giving her diplomatic immunity.
<ul><li> This is a case of right idea, wrong words: the limited diplomatic immunity that service staff gets would not protect her from being deported (even people with full diplomatic immunity can be deported after being declared <em>persona non grata</em>), but being issued a service passport <em>would</em> change her immigration status, so if she was being deported for overstaying her visa, it would take care of the core problem anyway.

A foreign diplomat is arrested for murder and invokes diplomatic immunity. The deputy mayor overseeing the investigation immediately goes to that country's ambassador and points out that the goodwill of the United States in general and of the NYPD in particular is worth more than trying to protect a corrupt diplomat who committed a murder for personal reasons. The ambassador agrees and promptly waives the diplomat's immunity on behalf of his country.

In another episode, it was believed he was harboring a suspected murderer (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a woman who turned out to be innocent</span>). The police officer interrogating him acknowledged he couldn't arrest Holmes but warned he could lose his job over that. That risk was quite real.
</li><li> A particularly egregious case from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue">NYPD Blue</a></em>: a Japanese diplomat is bribed to sign a statement where he admits to the murder of a call girl, and then leaves the country. This admission is taken at face value by the FBI and the top brass of the NYPD (but not by Sgt. Sipowicz). Even though the police officials have reasons to be happy to close the case, nobody even has a thought of requesting the help of the Japanese authorities to remove his diplomatic immunity, or even have him interrogated by Japanese police. This is extremely glaring for a show that normally tries to give a realistic view of police work - but it occurs in the very last episode of the last season, when the writers apparently had given up even trying.
</li><li> A first-season episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadamSecretary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadamSecretary">Madam Secretary</a></em> revolves around the Washington police discovering that an official from the Bahraini embassy has basically imprisoned his Indonesian housekeeper in his basement. It's in a legal gray area initially—because of the official's rank it's unclear whether the incident is covered—but then the Bahraini government promotes him to a level that has full diplomatic immunity and gets him out of the country. Elizabeth tries to get him extradited via her being old friends with the crown prince, that doesn't work, and then the prince announces the official will be tried in Bahrain... and is promptly assassinated on live TV.
