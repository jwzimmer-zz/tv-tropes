</p><p>The actual Golden Rule is about always attempting to look at things from the perspective of others, freely forgiving wrongs, and believing that no one should have to suffer at all, even if they deserve to. This warped form, however, takes this literally as Newtonian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">Equivalent Exchange</a> "justice" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallItKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallItKarma">Call It Karma</a>, not taking into account that acts of revenge/justice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardOnSoftScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardOnSoftScience">are not quantifiable laws of physics but social phenomena</a>. Because of the complex web of genetic and social bonds that one forms over a lifetime, as well as the interactions between everyone entangled in that web, revenge might well begin with you but it most likely will not end with you. If he deserved to be treated how he treated you, <em>his</em> loved ones may also believe that <em>you</em> deserve to be treated like you treated him too. And yours may believe the same. And so on and so forth. It gets worse if it involves racism, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">fantastic</a> or otherwise. The result of this is frequently what is called a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud">Blood Feud<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or Vendetta.

The escalating body count creates a vicious circle that spreads out like a virus, causing more and more casualties as it goes on, until it ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">one party</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">if not both of them</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">getting wiped out entirely</a> or being stopped.
</p><p>The Cycle of Revenge is one way to show that "two wrongs make a right" is a logically fallacious claim by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstructing</a> its use as justification for vengeance.

</p><p>A note on the "eye for an eye" maxim: many ethnologists believe that this wasn't a demand to go out and seek revenge, but rather a <em>ban</em> on inflicting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> (so if someone blinds you in one eye, you can only half-blind them back, and cannot justify torture or murder). According to this theory, those who laid down this rule believed that this limitation would ensure satisfaction of the Golden Rule for everyone and put a brake on the entropy of such vicious cycles.
</p><p>According to another theory, espoused by Jewish rabbis, the Hebrew actually implies that monetary compensation can be given in place of the eye, with the amount of the compensation to be the same regardless of whose eye was harmed (hence, "eye for an eye"). Unfortunately, given human nature in general, people didn't much listen (especially when "monetary compensation" simply led to unjust instances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">Screw the Rules, I Have Money!</a>), and as a result — as Mahatma Gandhi, a well-known nonviolence activist, is supposed to have put it — "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."
</p><p>Kind of makes you wish someone, in an attempt to counter this cancerous mutation of the Golden Rule, learned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">Turn the Other Cheek</a> or ask for (and give) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness">Forgiveness</a>, or at least just deliver a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainedRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainedRevenge">Restrained Revenge</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">But it rarely works</a>, as chances are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">you'll be punished anyway</a> (for extra salt in the wounds, the enemy in question, especially if a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who deserved it, will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">continue their misdeeds unhampered</a>, continuing to ruin the lives of people, you still being one of them).

</p><p>Used poorly, this trope can come off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseDichotomy">False Dichotomy</a>, suggesting that if someone kills your loved one then your options are to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">kill their loved one</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">let the person who killed your loved one get away with it</a>.

After all, if he was evil to you, it doesn't mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">he may not have been loving to them.</a>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfroSamurai">Afro Samurai</a></em> has this as the main theme of the series. Sure, you can get the title of being the number one fighter, but you have to take lives to do so. Which won't sit well with the surviving kin/friends of the deceased, as Afro roughly finds out.
<ul><li> At the end of <em>Resurrection</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Afro has come to accept this. On reclaiming the Number One headband, he goes to a child whose adoptive father Afro killed in front of him — the same way Afro's father was killed in front of <em>him</em> — and hands him the Number Two headband, with a quiet, "Any time you're ready".</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkameGaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkameGaKill">Akame ga Kill!</a></em> has this in spades. One example from volume 2: Seryu's father was killed on duty as an Imperial Guard, so she vowed to be strong enough to avenge his death, and then the Night Guard kills Ogre, who not only was a Guard Captain, but also her master. So she swears revenge on the Night Guard. When she runs into Mine and Sheele, it becomes clear that Seryu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">a bit too far off the deep end</a> as she bisects Sheele, leaving Mine, in turn, with the desire to avenge her. Tatsumi swears revenge, too, but is quickly snapped out of it. And it doesn't stop there. Oh, no.
</li><li> Brought up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, in regards to the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marley vs. Eldia conflict.</span> In a flashback, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren Kruger</span> tells <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Grisha, Eren's father</span> that without love they're "doomed to repeat it all again. The same history. The same mistakes. Again and again." While it hasn't yet been made clear exactly what he's referring to, the context implies he's talking about this trope.
<ul><li> It's also mentioned in one of the chapter cliffhanger lines, "Will the tragic cycle ever stop?!", during the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Liberio battle, when a lot of killing is going on.</span>
</li><li> Deliberately averted by Sasha's father when he's confronted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sasha's murderer, Gabi.

For instance, Lucy is driven to her acts through cruel and depraved treatment, but after killing the horrible people, she kills innocents as well, and infects others who survive their encounters with her. Infectees ended up with their children being born silpelits, and in turn, the silpelits kill their families as well, so they sign up to suppress the diclonius virus, causing many inhuman experiments. The experiments break out and kill the scientists and several innocents, so the military puts them down. Kurama was infected by a silpelit, and loses his wife in child-birth, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seemingly</span> kills Lucy's only friend, and captures her, so she maims his adopted daughter and kills his biological one.

He then goes on to describe how any survivors of his raids would escape, grow up, amass its own horde, then start raiding the settlements of the Praying Races. This is <em>not</em> portrayed as something that needs to be broken by diplomacy though. Why? The <em>other</em> major reason that goblins come into conflict with the Praying Races is that they are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> race that commits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a> against literally <strong>everyone else</strong> and the <em>only</em> way for them to reproduce is by <em>raping females of other races</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltFreeExterminationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltFreeExterminationWar">The only way this can end is when one side is totally wiped out.</a>

<div class="indent"> <strong>Cagalli Yula Athha</strong>: "One guy's killed for killing another and then he's killed for killing him. How is that kind of twisted thinking ever gonna bring us peace? Well?"
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, this trope is manifested in Kamille and Jerid's series-long rivalry. Throughout the series, there's a back and forth of Kamille and Jerid killing the people that the other cares about, deepening their rivalry to pure hatred. It gets to the point where it seems like the only thing Jerid cares about is killing Kamille, who actually loses intrest in him when it's clear that he's already outclassed him. Interestingly, the rivalry only started on the <em>second</em> killing - when Jerid killed Kamille's mother, Kamille conceded that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a> and that he honestly didn't know that the orders were to commit murder (he had been instructed to destroy an object rather than allow the enemy to claim it, not knowing that there was a person inside) until after the fact. The feud started a few episodes later when Kamille killed Jerid's former instructor in a fairly fought duel.
</li><li> This trope dominates the latter half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>' first season.

Biscuit's death caused the members of Tekkadan to fight for revenge, much to the dismay of their level-headed supervisor Merribell.
<ul><li> Ein himself is the most extreme example: Mikazuki kills his commanding officer Lt. Crank in Episode 3, and he spends the rest of the season hunting Tekkadan for payback; he even gets pissed off when he realizes they've salvaged Crank's mecha for their own use, and resolves to take it back in his honor.

</li><li> The Fishmen Island arc is all about this, bringing together several subplots that have been running since the beginning of the series.

Thus, when Thanos' army invades Earth, Atlantis is unable to repel it while Wakanda can. Namor bows to Thanos, who is looking for an Infinity Gem, and tells him it's in Wakanda, which he knows it's not. Wakanda is nearly destroyed when Thanos focuses almost all of his resources on it. Afterwards, Namor claims responsibility for the attack, and tells Panther his only regret is that so many Wakandans lived. The two get into a brawl, and Namor is expelled from the Illuminati. Namor starts his own secret organisation, the Cabal, to combat the multiverse crisis, and they are given Wakanda as their home base by the world's various governments. The Cabal kill Shuri. Eventually, Namor admits that his Cabal is out of control, and T'Challa and Black Bolt (another Illuminati member and monarch) say they'll help Namor defeat them.

The protagonist's desire for revenge against the detective by whom she was seduced and betrayed fuels her repeated escape attempts. Thus, the guards hate her. This results in harsh punishments for all the prison inmates, which means they all hate her too, and they hate the guards almost as much. The warden hates her personally for causing all the trouble, and for the pain and embarrassment she's caused to happen to him personally. In the 2nd film, savage new inmate Oba sees her as a threat to her dominance among the prisoners, causing more betrayal down the line, and a new vendetta for Matsu. The 3rd film replaces the guards with detective Kondo, who takes her escape understandably personally. There's also the jealous woman downstairs from her, and old enemy Katsu to deal with.

Roarke murdered six men to avenge the death of Summerset's daughter. Then the wife of one of the six men raises her son to murder six people who helped Roarke hunt down the six men, as well as Summerset, Eve, and Roarke to make a novena.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgeOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgeOfFire">Age of Fire</a></em>: A recurring theme throughout the series, but especially highlighted in Dragon Avenger. Wistala eventually tries to end this in regards to the Dragonblade line by making peace with the current one and his family, rather than take revenge on him for killing her father.
</li><li> By the time of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em> novel, the Atreides and Harkonnen families had been feuding for millenia, and the feud only ended with the death of Feyd, Rabban and Vladimir (the last surviving members of the Harkonnen family, not counting Vladimir's unacknowledged daughter Jessica and her Atreides descendants) at the end of the book. Accoriding to the first book, the feud apparently started because at some point thousands of years earlier, an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegendsOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegendsOfDune">prequels of questionable canonicity</a> expand upon the origins of the feud. Xavier Harkonnen and Vorian Atreides were friends. Xavier then dies, and his name is dragged through the mud as a traitor by politicians. Vorian knows the truth but conceals it for the good of the Butlerian Jihad. One of Xavier's grandkids, Abulurd Butler, starts looking up to Vorian. Later, Vorian reveals the truth to him, and Abulurd publicly changes his last name to Harkonnen. During the final Battle of Corrin, Abulurd sabotages the controls of the fleet in order to avoid causing the deaths of millions of human slaves, since Vorian was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">determined to destroy the machines once and for all</a> at that point, no matter the cost. Instead of understanding his protege's actions, Vorian labeled him a coward and had him exiled to the icy Lankiveil. Embittered, Abulurd indoctrinated his children to hate the Atreides, starting the feud. Abulurd's grandson Griffin seeks out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">Long-Lived</a> Vorian and tries to kill him, but Vorian manages to befriend the boy. Unfortunately, just then, Vorian's android siblings catch up to him and offhandedly kill Griffin as a witness. Distraught, Vorian sends Griffin's body back to his family with words of sorrow. However, Griffin's sister Valya (already hateful of Vorian) interprets the words as mockery and assumes Vorian killed her brother. She joins the Sisterhood and, eventually, becomes its Mother Superior, using it to advance her goals of lifting up her House and getting revenge on the Atreides. She trains her younger sister Tula and sends her to Caladan, where Tula marries and then kills Vorian's descendant Orry. Orry's brother Willem joins Vorian on the hunt for Tula. They travel to Lankiveil, confronting Tula's family, but Vorian prevents Willem from exacting revenge on innocents. In the end, Valya and Tula confront Vorian and Willem on Corrin, where Vorian is seemingly killed in an explosion. In fact, Vorian survives but opts to stay in hiding in order to end the feud. Satisfied, Valya and Tula leave (Willem can't bring himself to kill Tula, who is pregnant with his brother's child). Willem travels to Salusa Secundus and becomes a member of Emperor Roderick's court... alongside Valya's other brother Danvis. Willem immediately starts plotting a way to kill Danvis in revenge for Vorian.
</li></ul></li><li> Awareness of this trope, and a desire to avert it, is the reason beyond a particularly unsavory aspect of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>. Families tend to be tightly-knit and very collective. It would be easy for a family caught committing treason to pin it on one sister, who would be executed and leave the others alive and wanting vengeance. So, unless it's believed that this was not a proper family and sisters were not united — as happened to the Whistlers well before the story's start — the whole family is killed.

The tide of the war had actually begun to turn against Antea in the previous book, and the armies of Elassae and Sarakal are closing in during most of the fifth book, but even though the Anteans had committed horrible atrocities against the innocent people of those two countries, and even though the spider priests were not entirely to blame for everything the Anteans had done, Cithrin and the other heroes spend much of the book trying to figure out a way to get the Elassans and Sarakalese to forswear revenge, precisely to prevent it from leading to another war down the line.

Mab Monroe killed the family of Genevieve Snow, so she grew up to be the assassin Gin Blanco and killed Mab. Then Mab's daughter Madeline comes to town and seeks revenge for the death of her parents (the father was another casualty of the Snow/Monroe feud). When Gin finally defeats her, she learns that Madeline has a young daughter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldNotHurtAChild">but refuses to end the cycle by eradicating the Monroe line</a>, instead arranging for the child to be returned to his father's custody.

Part of the problem is that the highlanders mistakenly believe that the swamplings control the deeplings, so everything the monsters do is blamed on the swamplings as well. That being said, the swamplings <em>do</em> genuinely kill any highlanders they find in the Swamp—but again, that's because the highlanders do the same to them.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novel <em>Chain of Attack</em> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, where multiple races have been wiped out in a war spanning <em>millennia</em>. The original perpetrators have long since been wiped out, with the current belligerents continuing the conflict because they believe the other party is the one who originally started the war—after all, even if you <em>think</em> you wiped the other guys out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">there's always the chance that you missed a colony somewhere, and the old enemy might still be lurking</a>. One race (the "winners" of the last series of battles) mistook the other (up-and-coming race) for their old enemy, and attacked without warning, continuing the conflict. It's believed that this chain of attacks has claimed many civilizations in the devastated sector of space the <em>Enterprise</em> finds itself.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FearStreet">Fear Street</a></em> series, the root of Shadyside's problems is the centuries-long feud between the Fear/Fier family and the Goode family because of major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinsOfOurFathers">Sins of Our Fathers</a>. In the late 1600s, the Fier brothers pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">Burn the Witch!</a> on the innocent Susannah Goode. Susannah's father, the actual witch, then cursed the Fier family to forever suffer. One of the grandsons of the brothers grew up believing the Goodes were witches bent on his family's destruction for no reason, and thusly spent his own life chasing the remnants of them down to kill <em>them</em> in revenge. His son put a 100-year stop to the curse by burying the family's cursed relic...only for one of the Goodes' descendants to eventually chase down his great-great-great-granddaughter and slaughter her family, kicking up the cycle yet again. It continues into present day.
</li><li> This is a major theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WingsOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WingsOfFire">Wings of Fire</a></em>, especially in the second and third arc. Its take on the cycle of revenge in war is that it's not the people that are your enemy, it's the corrupt leaders that force them to fight.
<ul><li> In the second arc, the IceWings and NightWings hate each other because the IceWings think Foeslayer, a NightWing, kidnapped their prince, and their child, Darkstalker, killed that prince. Meanwhile, Darkstalker hated the IceWings because the prince, his father, was abusive toward him and his sister. When he is reawakened after two thousand years, he creates a plague to infect almost every living IceWing in hopes of getting them all killed. This drives the IceWings to attack the NightWings , who know the plague is an attack on them. This leads the NightWings to hate them more due to the attack. In the end, the fight is only stopped when a spell is cast to allow the dragons on both sides to understand the other tribes' feelings and see them as equals, rather than a faceless enemy to be fought.
</li><li> In the third arc, the history of Pantala has this theme as well. HiveWings tried conquering the LeafWings (who fought back and were almost completely wiped out, along with the trees they fought to protect) and the SilkWings (who surrendered and now live as a lower class society subservient to the HiveWings). The remaining LeafWings are pretty resentful, and revolutionary groups within them plan to burn down hives where the HiveWings and SilkWings live. Unfortunately, this would not only kill supporters of the war, but also innocent dragons who either couldn't, refused to, or were unable to participate in the war, as well as several blameless SilkWings, especially their dragonets, who can't fly away from fires since they aren't born with wings. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The protagonists try to prevent this, but it happens anyway.</span>

</li><li> Unsurprisingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revenge">Revenge</a></em> fits this trope to a T, and it constitutes the bulk of the 4-season narrative.

Amanda pleads with Keane to reconsider and call off his grudge, in part because since both Duncan and Keane are truly good men with lots of friends and allies, and so she says this trope is likely to be the outcome if either one kills the other in a duel. Whoever dies, their friends will try to avenge them, and then friends of those friends get involved, and the whole thing spirals completely out of control.

<ul><li> King Agamemnon kills a deer in a sacred grove and boasts he is the best hunter. Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, orders a sacrifice of him for such a disrespectful statement, making him kill his daughter Iphigenia. After doing so, the king gets killed by his wife and Iphigenia's mother. She in turn gets killed by her own son for killing his father.
</li><li> As usual with Greek myths, there are actually several explanations why Artemis demanded Iphigenia's sacrifice, including one that was because Agamemnon's father had failed to sacrifice the first lamb of his flock to her, while according to Aischylos it was because two eagles (who symbolized Agamemnon and his brother Menelaos) had torn a pregnant hare to pieces, which enraged the goddess. And in the Iliad, Iphigenia wasn't sacrificed at all (Agamemnon offers the hands of all his three daughters in marriage to Achilles), while according to Euripides she was saved at the last moment and transported to Tauris (on the Crimea) to become a priestess at the local temple to Artemis...
</li><li> The story is further complicated by Klytaimnestra (Agamemnon's queen) hooking up with Aigisthos, murderer of Agamemnon's father Atreus, who wanted to get revenge on Agamemnon for driving his father Thyestes (Atreus' brother) into exile from Mycene. (Because of an oracle, Thyestes had fathered Aigisthos by raping his own daughter Pelopia, in order to avenge his other children whom Atreus had killed). Aigisthos and Klytaemnestra together killed Agamemnon and Klytaemnestra for good measure also killed Agamemnon's prisoner/concubine Cassandra of Troy. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note07bvo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note07bvo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note07bvo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">See also: "Under the Ice" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlindGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlindGuardian">Blind Guardian</a>.</span>

Years later, in the early stages of the Horus Heresy, the Word Bearers responded by attempting to wipe out the Ultramarines to the last man, mingling a greater objective (victory for Horus) with some good old-fashioned revenge. Since then, the two Legions have taken every available chance to murder each other, even after the Ultramarines were divided into largely independent Chapters.

<ul><li> One of the oldest surviving plays, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheOresteia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheOresteia">The Oresteia</a></em>, is about a set of interconnected cycles of revenge that stretch across three generations and involve multiple deities on different sides. In the end, Athena has to be brought in to sort it all out.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare">Shakespearean</a> dramas:
<ul><li> There's some of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>. In the course of avenging his father, Hamlet ends up with Laertes after him for killing <em>his</em> father (which was, ironically enough, an accident). Though Laertes going after Hamlet wasn't simply because Polonius was killed, but rather because Ophelia committed suicide not long after, having gone bat-shit crazy upon hearing of her father's death.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>, the Capulets and the Montagues alternately avenge every death that the opposing family caused. It's been going on for so long that the two warring families have forgotten exactly who started it and over what. In fact, it's gotten so bad that the local prince has decreed that the next time one side starts something, the guilty party will be put to death—not that he's able to enforce it as stringently as he'd like<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1qc4y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1qc4y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1qc4y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The first time it happens, two of the three involved parties are already dead, and he settles for exiling the last one standing, Romeo, after the Montagues appeal, and it's hinted that the fact that the guy Romeo had killed in the fight was the one who started it may have factored into his decision; the second time, <em>both</em> parties are already dead by the time the prince shows up, and the one that gets it in the throat for the fight is an apothecary who wasn't even involved in the fight and whose only crime was giving one of the combatants a poison with the intent that he kills himself</span>. Only the deaths of the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> are enough to get both families to snap out of it.

The oppressed became the new generation of oppressors" after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Jedi left Taris to fight more battles against the Mandalorians</span>, bitterly lamenting that "the non-humans were never treated well in either case." There's also some cut dialogue for Juhani where she admits that she still hates and fears Mandalorians for committing genocide against her people, and voices her disapproval of Canderous among the crew. In one of the options, you can propose she go and kill him. She is still enough of a Jedi to balk at the idea of cold-blooded murder. However, when you meet up with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Xor, a mercenary who participated in the Cathar genocide, and who later murdered Juhani's father in a bar fight and tried to buy her as a slave</span>, those with darker tendencies can cheerfully encourage her to skewer the jerk on her lightsaber.

(Blood killed Braden to try and eliminate the stable from competition). Unfortunately, Blood and the last target of the Great Hunt (a Jedi Master) are on a Republic warship. Either way, Blood and the Jedi are dead by the Hunter's actions...which causes the Jedi Master's best friend (the Jedi Order's battlemaster), to declare revenge on the Hunter, resorting to framing the Hunter for a laundry list of trumped-up charges (their own crimes would have been sufficient), sending out squads of soldiers and other Jedi after the Hunter, and killing off the Hunter's friends and contacts.

</li><li> The reason behind the Alliance and the Horde being more or less openly at war in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> after being allies at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> III</em>. Some people just couldn't get over the fact that the enemy they had fought for so long wasn't an enemy anymore.
<ul><li> On PvP servers, you can easily experience a Cycle of Revenge first-hand.
</li><li> A similar issue exists between two Outland factions, the Aldor and the Scryer. While they both are part of the same alliance, players are forced to choose between the two.
</li><li> Camp Taurajo in the Southern Barrens becomes the start of one. The Alliance sacks Taurajo, the Horde responds by killing the General who carried out the attack, and the other Alliance leaders swear vengeance on the Horde for the assassination. Ironically, General Hawthorne was trying to avoid civilian casualties because he didn't want a Cycle of Revenge, but didn't factor in the quillboar who were mortal enemies of the Tauren.
<ul><li> It's also hinted he didn't count on the rabidly anti-Horde ambassador. The Ambassador's interest in the Horde's desire for revenge, the easily located spy with an itinerary for the General's journey, and the speed with which a replacement is found are too convenient. This Cycle was planned.
</li></ul></li><li> Taran Zhu, leader of the Shado-Pan, calls both sides out on this in the latest patch:
<div class="indent"><strong>Taran Zhu:</strong> ENOUGH!! There will be no more bloodshed today. I see now why your Alliance and Horde cannot stop fighting. Every reprisal is itself an act of aggression, and every act of aggression triggers immediate reprisal. [...] SILENCE! YOU must break the cycle. It ends TODAY. Here. The cycle ends when you, Regent Lord, and you, Lady Proudmoore, turn from one another. And walk. <em>Away.</em>

Goro naturally believes that Lao is wanting to continue the fight for vengeance, but Lao tells him no, the attack was just to let the big lug know he hasn't forgotten what he did all those centuries ago, but is willing to put aside their differences for the sake of peace. Goro agrees, hinting that were his and Lao's ancestor's fates were reversed, Goro's own son would've likely been the one asking Lao (or his ancestor, since being Champion of MK gives you natural immortality) for peace.

Long ago, a group of humans attacked the Dalish Elves in the Brecilian Forest, killing the son and raping the daughter (who was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> upon learning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">she was pregnant</a>) of the elven Keeper Zathrian. In his rage and grief, Zathrian summoned a forest spirit and bound it in the body of a wolf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">using his own blood</a>, creating Witherfang. Witherfang then cursed the humans, and turned them into the first werewolves. Centuries later, those humans' descendants are still cursed. Under the guidance of Witherfang (who gained sentience and intelligence as the Lady of the Forest), this new generation of werewolves are attacking the Dalish and spreading the curse to them, partly for revenge against Zathrian (who is still alive because he is bound to Witherfang) and partly because they are trying to force Zathrien to undo his curse. The werewolves believe they are being unfairly punished for their ancestors' crimes. Zathrian believes that their current actions prove that they are just as savage as their ancestors and deserve the curse no less. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide how this cycle is resolved.
<ul><li> Even if you cure the werewolves and end the curse, the cycle threatens to perpetuate itself with Dalish elves who now want revenge on the former werewolves for killing members of their clan. Hawke can encounter the daughter of a Dalish hunter-turned werewolf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> who is threatening to murder one of these former werewolves. Hawke can choose to peacefully resolve the situation, leave the former werewolf to his fate, or kill the elf and her companions.
<ul><li> This Trope also comes to play if you're a Human Noble. The Warden avenges his/her parents' murders by killing Arl Howe during the last 1/4 of the game. Later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Dragon Age: Origins  Awakening</a></em>, one of your first party member candidates is his son Nathaniel, who was about to assasinate the Warden as a revenge for his father's death, but got captured for trespassing before he had the chance to slip a dagger between his target's ribs. Part of Nathaniel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> later on is cutting the cycle once he learns and understands what a bastard his father was and that he had it coming.
</li></ul></li><li> This is repeatedly noted to be a recurring problem between mages and Templars. The few mages who would abuse their powers regardless lash out at the Templars. The Templars judge all mages by that example and lash out in kind. This causes otherwise reasonable mages to resent the Templars, making them lash out. Things repeated this way until it got to the point where things exploded both literally and metaphorically.

The first boss is Helter Skelter's younger brother who wants revenge. Matt Helms killed his parents as a ghost for leaving him in a burning house to die. Two assassins come back to fight you despite dying in the previous game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And the final boss, Jasper Batt Jr., has Bishop murdered at the start of the game out of revenge for Travis killing his father and two brothers in the side missions in the last game, something the player probably doesn't even remember.</span> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroesTravisStrikesAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroesTravisStrikesAgain">No More Heroes: Travis Strikes Again</a></em> continues the theme by introducing Bad Man, the father of Bad Girl who's out for revenge for her death at Travis' hands.

The warrior decides to get revenge, hops into a ship that happens to be nearby, and flies to the other planet to massacre the inhabitants there. Then he descends into that planet's tunnels, meets a woman, and has a son with her. Thirty years later, the son comes out of the tunnels and finds ruins of a thriving city on the surface, and learns that a warrior from the other planet is responsible. He decides to get revenge on the other planet, flies over there and kills everyone, then descends into the tunnels where he meets a woman... After a couple iterations, the game outright announces: "Vicious Cycle".
</li><li> In a warped way, this is what the Bogeyman embodies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour">Silent Hill: Downpour</a></em>. The game's plot mainly revolves around this, the protagonist having murdered (or attempted to murder) another convict who (might have) murdered his son. That plot resolves with the warden of the prison being brutally beaten by a corrupt guard (or killed by the protagonist), which sets his police officer daughter against the protagonist. She can also go for the actual culprit, but all of these revenge attempts are all dependent on the player's actions throughout the story.
</li><li> Lara Croft and Werner Von Croy use the trope on each other throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheLastRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheLastRevelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a></em> and the final chapter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderChronicles">Tomb Raider Chronicles</a></em>. Teenage Lara goes on an expedition with Von Croy and is forced to leave him behind when his tampering with the Iris artifact causes the area to collapse and traps him. Von Croy is rescued some time later and keeps the artifact while being bitter towards Lara, who he thinks abandoned him. Lara then infiltrates Von Croy's research building and steals the Iris artifact from him. This in turn causes Von Croy (several years later) to seek revenge by hiring mercenaries to stop or kill Lara in Egypt so that he can claim the Amulet of Set (succeeding), and then he goes on to capture Lara's friend, holding him hostage in exchange for the Armor of Horus. After Lara's apparent demise when the pyramid she is in collapses as Von Croy watches in horror, Lara escapes some time later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderAngelOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderAngelOfDarkness">The Angel of Darkness</a></em> and is angry at Von Croy for leaving her back in Eygpt. The entire cycle of revenge is finally broken when a third party unrelated to the two characters kills Von Croy.
</li><li> A variation is the key story trope of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade">Infinity Blade</a></em>. The game starts off with the tyrannical God King killing one who opposes him. Then, some 20 years later, that man's son comes to avenge him  and after fighting through the God King's castle, also gets killed. And so on, and so on, until you either manage to kill the God King, or fight him to a standstill and agree to join him. In the former case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you've accomplished <em>nothing</em> except making some powerful new enemies who have no reason to hold the man who killed the God King in any higher regard than they held the God King. Then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">you skip to the next in the bloodline avenging his father, because the game is built around this preconception</a></span>. In the latter case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you find out the God King was <strong>one of the good guys</strong>  unlike the <em>other</em> Deathless, he doesn't think that being immortal gives him license to be a colossal jerk for no reason, and the whole exercise was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">The Plan</a> to lure powerful warriors to his castle, where he'd either kill them to enhance his power or recruit them as his champion so he could take on the others</span>. If that isn't pointless enough, the sequel reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your character wasn't <em>actually</em> avenging anyone in the first place. He's an amnesiac immortal, with each reincarnation believing his previous incarnation to be his dead father in need of avenging.</span>

</li><li> This happens <em>twice</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>.
<ul><li> The first involves the Iconians and the Romulans. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Iconians return after a 200,000 year disappearance and prepare to take over the galaxy. This ultimately forces the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> and a few others to go back in time to the day the Iconians disappeared to make sure they all die. However, you find out that the Iconians are actually pretty good and decide to help them survive except for former Romulan emperor Sela, who is seeking revenge for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">the Hobus Supernova and the destruction of Romulus and Remus</a>. She attacks and kills a few Iconians, leading to one Iconian, T'Ket, to vow revenge for their deaths which Sela realizes too late that meant that <em>she</em> caused Hobus!</span>
</li><li> The second involved the Tholians and the Na'kuhl''. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Time traveling Na'kuhl attack and massacre a Tholian colony 2270, though the Federation is able to prove innocence in this attack when two ships get caught up in it. 140 years later, they're able to spring a time travelling trap on Kal Dano to steal the Tox Uthot and use it to destroy the Na'kuhl's sun. This sets off the Na'kuhl's desire to tear through time in revenge which sends them to 2270 to attack the Tholians.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed by the peaceful Sahagin Clutchfather Novv in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>. Years past, he was a terrifying pirate with a known penchant for bloodshed. Returning from a raid, he found the vast majority of his children slaughtered, their bodies left in a pile by those seeking vengeance against him. Hitting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>, he realized his role in the cycle, and strove to end it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One of his surviving children, however, was all too happy to perpetuate it...</span>
<ul><li> This concept is the foundation of the plot in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s first expansion, <em>Heavensward</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A thousand years ago, Ishgardians murdered Ratatoskr, one of the First Brood of dragons. This sent many of the dragons, particularly Ratatoskr's brood-brother Nidhogg, into a rage; they've spent the past thousand years extracting their revenge. This, in turn, has caused countless casualties for the Ishgardians, who have been lied to about the cause of the war, and now seek revenge on the dragons for their own fallen.</span> This cycle is particularly seen with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Estinien, a dragoon whose entire village was wiped out by Nidhogg. He's only able to come to peace and overcome Nidhogg's influence when, with the help of Alphinaud and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">the Warrior of Light</a>, he realizes that his desire for revenge makes him no different than Nidhogg, and finally lets his anger go.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The conflict between humans and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Adepts</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzureStrikerGunvolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzureStrikerGunvolt">Azure Striker Gunvolt</a></em>. Humans hate Adepts for their powers and the fact that Adepts have attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> and have caused massive damage to it, and want to either kill them all or subject them to harsh experimentation to "control" them. Adepts hate humans for treating them like sub-humans, capturing and imprisoning them unjustly, experimenting on them to control them, or just trying to kill them for the crime of having powers, thus leading them to want to wipe humanity off the map and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>. Things are "relatively" peaceful now, but a few sparks on either side are all that's needed to start a full-out war again.
</li><li> While not always revenge-driven, a similar cycle occurs throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a></em> series. Humans treat reploids as servants until Sigma, believing that reploids can achieve their true potential if they're taken out from under humanity's thumb, wages war against humanity. The resulting Maverick Wars and the sheer destruction they cause eventually leads to Dr. Weil believing that humans would be better off if reploids were robbed of their free will, leading to him corrupting the Mother Elf into the Dark Elf for that purpose and sparking the even more destructive Elf Wars, which ends in Weil being trapped in an immortal body and sent out to wander the wastelands he created for all eternity, giving him an unending hatred of both reploids <em>and</em> humans and ensuring that he'd be oppressing both when he finally came back into power. Meanwhile, Neo Arcadia, under Copy-X, oppressed reploids even harder than before in order to protect humanity, eventually leading to Elpizo seizing control of the Dark Elf in order to destroy humanity all over again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em> retroactively establishes that this has been going on in a small scale. Namely, first Dutch's gang <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills Edgar Ross's partner-in-arms, Agent Milton. Years later, Ross forces John Marston, a former member of said gang, to kill or capture 3 other members of the gang that are still at large, before murdering John as well, avenging Milton and taking the credit for finally bringing the gang down. However, years later, John's son Jack hunts down and kills Ross for killing his father.</span>
</li><li> One sidequest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> revolves around this. A Resistance member is missing, and the player eventually finds their body, alongside a blood-soaked, still alive Machine Lifeform. After killing it, the player finds out that they both wanted revenge against each other, and once the player reports the Resistance member's death to their friend, she vows to destroy all Machine Lifeforms, and leaves the camp, weapon in hand, and is never seen again.
</li><li> The conflict between the Inklings and Octarians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> resembles this. Rising tides caused the Octarians to wage war with the Inklings over the remaining territories. The Octarians nearly won, but due to a careless plug that deactivated their Great Octoweapons, they were unable to stop the Inkling retaliation. The Octarians were driven into underground domes, which slowly began to deteriorate over the next century. Embittered by their defeat as well as facing an energy crisis, the Octarians plot their revenge with Zapfish thefts and the eventual invasion of Inkopolis. Their actions only led to the formation of the New Squidbeak Splatoon, an Inkling militia dedicated to take back the Zapfish and tear the Octarian forces apart. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a>: Octo Expansion</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">is breaking this cycle</a>, with Agent 8 and the other Octolings abandoning DJ Octavio's quest for revenge, and the Inklings dropping old prejudices to share their culture and home with their former rivals</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelySecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BravelySecond">Bravely Second</a></em> touches upon this through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Janne</span>, who is more than willing to kill Othar's house (but not Othar himself as he hadn't done anything to him) for having masssacred his own house.

Some time later, after Tavros, with whom everything started, has apparently forgiven her, Aradia (now a ghost inhabiting a robot) delivers a near-fatal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">beatdown</a> to Vriska.

Counterpoint can't let it go, since he's some sort of incarnation of Ares. He gets some muscle to help him pound Jobe. Jobe can't let it go, since he's the crown prince of Karedonia (his father is a supervillain) and has obligations to make sure people know he can't be pushed around.

</li><li> There was pretty much a Seesaw of Revenge going on in the backstory, starting in 997 and possibly ending in 1058: In 997, Gillecomgain's father, Mail Brigti, was killed in battle against Findlaech, and although Findlaech didn't strike the killing blow (and didn't even want to kill Mail Brigti anyway), Gillecomgain still blamed Findlaech for Mail Brigti's death. Then, in 1020, partly to avenge Mail Brigti and partly because Duncan commanded it, Gillecomgain murdered Findlaech. In 1032, Findlaech's son Macbeth learned that Gillecomgain had killed his father and killed Gillecomgain for revenge; then, in 1040, he learned that Duncan had demanded his father's death and killed Duncan as well. In 1057, Duncan's son Canmore "killed" Macbeth to avenge Duncan, and Macbeth's son Luach swore vengeance against Canmore. Whether the cycle was broken <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Luach died in battle against Canmore in 1058</span> is debatable.
</li><li> Gargoyles does contain one aversion to this trope. Xanatos refuses to pursue revenge on any of his enemies, calling it "a sucker's game". Judging by what happened to the other revenge seekers on this show, Xanatos may be right. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Xanatos did pursue revenge, albeit reluctantly, in "Double Jeopardy," but he was also thoroughly defeated by Thailog in that episode.</span>

<ul><li> A part of the reason the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">ArabIsraeli Conflict</a> has lasted so long is largely because of this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">Everybody knows somebody who was killed by someone on the other side</a>, and hardliners on both sides feel that they need to take action to make everything even - Palestinian Terrorists launch an attack on Israel, which causes Israel to retaliate, which makes Palestinians more angry and more likely to take drastic action. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Both sides will also claim the other side started it</a>.
</li><li> To prevent cycles of revenge from going on forever, or turning into <em>spirals</em> of revenge, the Anglo-Saxons, as well as many other medieval societies had the institution of "wer-gild", or blood money. Someone outside the feud would come in and decide who had suffered the most (i.e., which side had suffered the most murders). The side that had suffered less would then have to pay a fine to the others' side proportional to the overzealousness of their revenge killings.
</li><li> There are several tribes particularly in South America and Africa that are plagued by this, having been stuck in perpetual warfare for generations because each death must be avenged with death.
</li><li> The culture of Vendetta on the islands of Sicily, Corsica and Crete caused this kind of thing to happen until very recently (and maybe it's not quite all over yet).
<ul><li> On Corsica, this combined with the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corsican_nationalism">separatist movement<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the tendency of both feuding families and separatists to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">bombs</a> as weapons of choice has led to the stereotypical association of the island in French media (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrancoBelgianComics">comics</a>) with the onomatopoeia <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">boum</a></em>.
</li><li> This cycle of vendetta has led in many regions to severe depopulation, as all males have either been killed or forced to flee due to centuries of vendette. In Albania, it is commonplace in such situations for a woman to take the gender role of a male (to have "social sex change").
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of gang violence boils down to this. Most being retaliations for other gang hits. For many "OGs" ("original gangstas"; i.e. the older generation of members, possibly dating back to the creation of the gang itself) this endless lifestyle of getting wronged, getting revenge, and then having revenge inflicted on you for the revenge, which prompts another revenge is what wears them down and inspires them to give up the life. The fact that many gang rules outright demand that revenge be taken in response only worsens the problem as trying to break the cycle is unacceptable and can be met with violent response from within.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. The Christmas Truce of 1914, as well as the general 'live and let live' attitude of 1914-15 (in which there were unofficial ceasefires wherein both sides tacitly agreed not to shoot each other), were unthinkable by the end of 1916. Too much blood had been spilt, everyone had lost too many friends, and the General Staffs on both sides had tried to encourage agression by frequent patrols/'trench raids'. The result was a sort of savage joy in the opportunity to kill the enemy in defensive engagements (in which they would be vulnerable to machine-gun fire) and to 'get at them' (in hand-to-hand fighting, preferably) when on on patrols/raids or on the attack. The Cycle Of Revenge is the main reason that the armies engaged on the Western Front (French, British, German, Italian, Austro-Hungarian) didn't simply fall apart from low morale, despite the mutiny of half of the entire French army in 1917 and the enormous underlying resentment for what was basically a pointless war. On the Eastern Front, the limitations of the Cycle Of Revenge were laid bare, as a steady decline in the relative number of trained officers and NCOs and the rations' quantity and quality and the relative value of the pay (due to inflation) eventually resulted in an French-style mutiny in 1917. It should be noted that the French and Russians were still eager to kill Germans and more than willing to defend their positions while mid-mutiny, it's just that at the time (1917) their concerns with food and pay meant they refused to go on the attack until all that was fixed.
</li><li> The Hatfield-McCoy feud, which, according to popular lore, began with a dispute over a hog and eventually led to the murder of dozens of people. The real reason for the feud probably had more to do with jealousy and a dispute over property rights in the valley where both families lived.
</li><li> Most wars between Maori tribes were "revenge wars", where they would try and get "utu" for their fallen chief, by killing the other tribe's chief.
</li><li> In Northern Ireland during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>, cycles of revenge killings known as "tit for tat killings" were very common. Essentially, random Protestants or Catholics were killed within hours of another killing — which would lead to another random killing...
</li><li> Germany &amp; France between 1870 and 1945. Germany's resounding victory in the Franco-Prussian war and subsequent annexation of territory led to 40+ years of "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanchism">Revanchism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" (from the French <em>revanche</em>, meaning "revenge") being a dominant political movement in France and to France seeking alliances and preparing for another war with Germany. And then the ethnically-German Habsburgs' Generals use the excuse of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's assassination to annex Serbia, which indirectly (once Russia committed itself to supporting Serbian independence) gave France an excuse to participate in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> once Germany had demanded they give up several strategic fortresses (upon threat of war). A decade-and-a-half after the French &amp; Allied victory in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, the Nazis came to power and (eventually, once war broke out over Poland) pursued their own agenda of revenge against France. Luckily after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, in which both nations were devastated and left reliant on US support in the face of possible Soviet aggression, they decided to work together...
<ul><li> It went back further than that. From a German point of view, 1870/71 was payback for the humiliating defeats of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a> (yes, they had beaten Napoleon in the end, but not without help from other great powers, most notably Russia and Great Britain). While in France, the victory of Jena and Auerstedt in 1806 was seen as revenge for the humiliating defeat at Rossbach against the Prussian army in 1757 during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar">Seven Years' War</a>, which in turn was seen by Germans as revenge for Louis XIV's wars of aggression, and so on until the middle ages. People in all seriousness talked of the "hereditary enmity" (<em>Erbfeindschaft</em>) between Germany and France, but that term actually first was coined to describe the long-running enmity between the houses of Habsburg (Austrian Archdukes, Dukes of Burgundy, Kings of Naples and Sicily, Holy Roman Emperors, and sometime-Kings of Castile and Aragon [Spain]) and Valois/Bourbon (Kings of France) that went back to Francis I of France and the accession of Charles V Holy Roman Emperor in 1519.
</li></ul></li><li> Sadly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> among the Roma and Sinti people. They are known to have the blood feud culture with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> and vendettas existing for centuries. In Finland, the Roma make <em>half</em> of all murder sentences in Finland while they represent only 0.5% of the Finnish population.
</li><li> The Norsemen during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Viking age</a> were infamous for this. If a man felt wronged by another, meaning an insult or an act of violence, there were four ways to resolve the conflict.
<ul><li> They could reach a settlement, tallying damages for both parties and having one pay a restitution to the other. Any man was honour-bound against breaking such a settlement.
</li><li> Next, there was the option of taking revenge. If a family member had been killed, his relatives as far related as cousins (including in-laws) were obligated to avenge the victim. With communities being small, it wasn't that uncommon for men to have to choose families as they had relatives in both, and usually, it ended up with entire communities fighting for generations. A man was honour-bound to avenge an unsettled vendetta, and the only alternative if he was unable or unwilling was fleeing the country.
</li><li> If a Viking wanted revenge without starting a blood feud, they would sometimes make their case at a <em>thing</em> (a court of chiefs and nobles). And while revenge killings were considered good and just, legal action was seen as underhanded and hostile, and as such was reserved for only the most serious of circumstances. Sentences were fines, banishment, or being declared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Outlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Outlaw">outlaw</a> (effectively a dishonourable, unavengable death sentence for you or anyone who helps you).
</li><li> Lastly, there was the option of demanding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialByCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialByCombat">Trial by Combat</a>. This meant either death, or a verdict of banishment or outlaw, for the loser, with a risk of death from wounds for the victor too.
<ul><li> Blood revenge continued in the Norse-lands even as they became monarchies, with the chieftains as nobles and jarls, until the 1200s, when the practice was banned in Norway and Sweden and replaced with courts and laws.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Montenegrins in particular are especially infamous for this. It even has its own name: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krvna_osveta">Krvna Osveta, Blood Feud<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Though it isn't as common nowadays, it still does happen in more remote areas.
</li><li> The Balkans in general. The breakdown in Yugoslavia involved (at least per the excuses given): Serbians taking revenge on Croats for siding with the Germans in World War 2 in revenge for the Serbians doing something to the Croats even earlier, and everyone against the Muslims due to the Turkish invasions of the 1500s, and so on and so forth. And then there are the Greeks and the Turks...for everyone else in the area, the joke goes that they're starting to get over grudges dating back to the Roman Empire. The Greeks and the Turks involve a revenge cycle going back to Classical Greece and the Persian Empire.
</li><li> Sadly, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> and a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> school bullying and cyberbullying cases. Some victims of school bullies eventually snap and go on a school shooting. Victims of cyberbullying who commit suicide will eventually lead to their friends or families hunting for the cyberbully's blood.
</li><li> In intelligence circles, this was known as "blowback", and was one of the biggest reasons behind the decision to catch and deport enemy spies during the Cold War, rather than summarily executing them as had occurred during war-time. If <em>they</em> kill one of <em>your</em> agents, then you find and kill one of <em>their</em> agents in revenge, and everything quickly devolves to everyone trying to kill everyone else, impeding the actual gathering of <em>intelligence</em> that agents are supposed to do. Blowback now generally refers to an intelligence operation where the results and/or consequences of it have negative effects on the country that initiated it, whether foreseen or otherwise.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>, the British would commit war crimes on American settlements in response to "American savagery" inflicted on British-American settlements, which in turn would cause the Americans to burn more British settlements, in revenge for "British savagery". The most triumphant example of this was when the Americans burned the Canadian city of York (modern Toronto, the largest city, and the De facto capital of British Canada at the time) only for the British to respond by torching the public buildings of Washington DC. In the same war, soldiers from both sides would routinely collect the scalps from the corpses of enemy soldiers as trophies. Newspapers on both sides demonised the other side for this practice, calling their enemies "little more than Indian savages", but at the same time, newspapers would be willing to turn a blind eye to this exact same activity on their own side. Since the war ended with the exact same borders that existed before the war, neither side gained anything from this activity except a bunch of burned down ruins where wealthy and thriving cities used to be, a large number of dead or displaced civilians, and a massive reconstruction bill costing thousands of pounds for both sides. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">But hey, at least they got a nice scalp collection out of it!</a>
</li><li> A non-violent and somewhat humorous variant occurs sometimes in Japan. When one person gives another a gift, it is often considered polite to give a "thank you" gift in return. This can occasionally prompt the first person to give <em>another</em> gift, until neither party wants to "lose" by being the first to not give a gift.
</li><li> One of the practical reasons why there are laws of war and treaties regarding the treatment of prisoners is specifically to reduce the risk of this happening. If you don't want your troops being tortured or murdered if captured, you don't torture members of the enemy force. This is one reason why the war on the Eastern Front during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> was considerably more prone to atrocities than fighting in other areas of Europe: when you have two dictatorships not particularly concerned about human rights or the welfare of the civilians on the other side fighting one another, then, inevitably, atrocity is met by atrocity.
</li><li> This is also the case with child abuse. The people who were abused as children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainOfHarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainOfHarm">may become child abusers themselves</a>. This may be because it was a cycle in the family for the kids and their ancestors to grow up being abused.
</li><li> Make no mistake, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre_of_Glencoe">Massacre of Glencoe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a horrific crime on many, many levels. But the fact that there is <em>still</em> lingering resentment between some MacDonalds and Campbells, more than three centuries after the crime itself, gives you some idea how long people can hold a grudge.
</li><li> The origin of the widespread civilian bombing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. German bombers sent to oil storage got lost, and low on fuel, bombed the first urban target they saw, hoping they found their mark. They had instead bombed London, and Churchill ordered revenge bombing on Berlin, which in turn led to Adolf Hitler to rescind his prior order to the luftwaffe to focus military-industrial targets and to ignore civilians. This lasted throughout the war in Europe, with the British wasting nighttime bombing runs on petty terror bombing and leaving the US with the unenviable job of destroying German industrial production by themselves through high-risk daylight raids.
<ul><li> It's been theorized (though not confirmed) that the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II">firebombing of Dresden<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was retaliation for the German bombings during The Blitz.
</li></ul></li><li> The origins of Singhasari Kingdom in the history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia">Indonesia</a>: Ken Arok killed Tunggul Ametung with a cursed Kris to claim his kingdom and his wife Ken Dedes, forming Singhasari and expanding the kingdom. Little did he know that Dedes already has a child from Ametung, Anusapati, who heard about his dad's murder and then took the same Kris and killed Arok. Unfortunately for him, Arok already had another child, Panji Tohjaya, from his first wife, and so he took the Kris and killed Anusapati. Anusapati's son, Ranggawuni, on the other hand, learned about the curse and so stepped out of the cycle by killing Tohjaya WITHOUT the Kris. Curse averted.
</li><li> The situation in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iraq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iraq">Iraq</a>. When the Ba'athist regime took power, the Sunnis controlled the government and discriminated against the Shias, despite these being the majority of the country, out of fear that they would topple them like what happened in Iran after the Islamic Revolution. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was overthrow by the US in 2003, the Shias were placed into power and began persecuting the Sunnis in retaliation. It became much, <em>much</em> worse in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArabSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArabSpring">The Arab Spring</a> with the rise of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">Islamic State of Iraq and Syria</a> which was formed in the sectarianism that preceded it and they were assisted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">disaffected local Sunnis</a> that were sick and tired of Shia oppression and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel">former Ba'athists</a> wanting to regain lost power. ISIS began a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">genocidal campaign</a> against not only the Shia Muslims, but also Assyrian Christians (forcing them to leave, pay a tax, convert or die) and Yazidis (enslaving their women and children). While Iraq had succeeded in beating ISIS, the Iraqi Sunnis are <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-election-sunnis/iraqs-sunnis-voting-without-hope-in-first-election-since-islamic-state-idUSKBN1I92JQ">now even more ostracized<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, not just by the Shias, but by the Assyrians and Yazidis as well.
