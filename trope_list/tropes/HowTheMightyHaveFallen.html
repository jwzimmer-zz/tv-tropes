The Roman Empire himself, for starters, is said to have had everything, but then vanished one day (although, as a young Italy remarks, he had many scars and was in pain beforehand, probably for a long time). Prussia used to be a great fighter, and now, he isn't a nation anymore. During the Revolution, America remarks on how England "used to be so big." Kind of played with in the case of France, when he isn't invited to one of the Allies' meetings and tries to remember some of his "finest hours," all of them ruthlessly destroyed/parodied (in the cases of Joan of Arc and Napoleon, because of England, and in two cases he just jumped into the fight when the enemy was already weak).
<ul><li> Portugal cheerfully says to Spain's face that he's happy that Spain's fallen into dire straits since his empire days since it makes him feel better about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">his own fate</a>.

The anime scene with him running sobbing from the warehouse to be killed by a heart attack a few minutes later is the <em>nice</em> version of his death, and within a few years, the world's gone back to normal. In the original manga, he's killed while writhing in agony and whining that he doesn't want to die.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDevilIsAPartTimer">The Devil Is a Part-Timer!</a>,</em> the titular Devil is transported from his world (where he is the commander of a massive army of demons and possesses extraordinary magical power) to our mundane world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">where he is no more powerful than a regular human</a> and has to take a job at a fast-food restaurant to survive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The same winds up being true for the Hero that tried to oppose him, as well as his most powerful subordinates.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goku more or less expresses this when he mocked Frieza's final attack after he deemed him too weak and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling">Not Worth Killing</a>. He states this again after Frieza was cut himself in half by his own attack. Finally, after being forced to blast Frieza after he tried to shoot him in the back, Goku has an expression that practically embodies this trope. For someone who was once called the most powerful being in the universe, it was indeed a mighty fall.
</li><li> Vegeta's demise during the Frieza Saga has shades of this. He's the Saiyan Prince and the strongest his race has to offer... and is left totally helpless and reduced to tears against Frieza's power. After being literally beaten to a bloody pulp, Vegeta is given an anti-climactic end by being shot through the heart and spends his last moments tearfully begging Goku, a lower-class warrior, to defeat Frieza and avenge their race.
</li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, this has happened to Frieza's entire empire. They went from being the most feared and powerful force in the universe, who controlled 70% of the known universe, to barely qualifying as an army after not only losing Frieza and his father but all their best fighters on Namek. According to Sorbet, they're on their last legs and are considered a laughing stock.
</li><li> Frost, Frieza's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateSelf">Universe 6 counterpart</a>. He's initially depicted as the Emperor of his universe, beloved by all as a hero, but during the Universe 6 Saga, it turns out that he's, in fact, a villain just like Frieza who does such things as start wars so he can end them and gain good publicity, which he openly brags about. Upon this reveal, he's one-shotted by Vegeta, beaten up by Hit after trying to steal Champa's cube, and becomes a fugitive on the run. Come the Universe Survival Saga, Hit finds him huddled in an alleyway, with nothing but a worn cloth to protect him from the elements.

After their master and strongest members go missing, most of the guild's remaining members leave the guild out of frustration or shame, the ones left behind are forced to foreclose their guildhall as it has become too expensive (the replacement building not-withstanding), they are constantly being hit up for money that they borrowed from a neighboring guild filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkasses</a>, and they lose their reputation by losing six consecutive years of the Grand Magic Games in a row.

<ul><li> Chronologically, the first one is the United Earth Government, which is the naturally the birthplace of humanity and focal point of all human civilization. However, shortly after colonization, they had already became decedent as their military grew way too large, their resources exhausted, and the native people lacking any intelligence and imagination as they focused more on financial and military power than self-sufficiency. As a result, the government became corrupt with Earth financiers and military lobbyists technically owning the government, allowing them to abuse colonies however they pleased. When the colonists has enough and rebelled, the military itself had become so decadent that they were more interested in killing people and plundering for jewels and treasures rather than hunting down the insurgents. By the time the colonies finally regained the upper hand, they were drastically on the receiving end of the abuse that was a hundred times worse than theirs. When the story finally starts, the Earth barely recognizable and nearly uninhabitable to the point its almost completely forgotten.

Cass, who still loves him despite everything, is saddened by his current state, while Jason, who is far less sympathetic, finds it so pathetic he almost pities him.
</li><li> The First Families of Gotham were once the five richest and most powerful families in Gotham, who helped the city recover from the American Revolution. Fast forward three hundred years later and only the Waynes are still thriving. The Crownes have died out, the Kanes are on the verge of dying out due to only having two female heirs, and the Elliots have only one male heir who has shown no interest in continuing the family line. Worst off is the Cobblepots, who lost almost all of their fortune by Bruce's time and have diminished to one male heir like the Elliots. That one male heir then rebuilt the family fortune with his connections as a crime boss and a supervillain, permanently shaming the Cobblepot name and ensuring that history would only ever remember them as a family of crooks. In Jason's timeline, all of the families (sans, of course, the Waynes) went extinct by the next generation.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>:
<ul><li> Theseus, the King of Athens, lived a life full of adventure and was considered up there with Heracles and Achilles in terms of Greek heroes. His accomplishments include: 1) Killing the Minotaur single-handedly and liberating Athens from Crete's control, 2) Disposing of his step-uncle and his fifty sons from Athens and ending their mafia-esque control of the kingdom, 3) Uniting the region of Attica under a single kingdom with Athens as its capital, 4) Defeated the Amazons, 5) Sailed with the Argonauts, 6) Participated in the Calydonian Hunt, 7) Fought in the Centaur wars, 8) Made the roads to Athens safer by personally hunting down every single bandit he could find. So what became of this legendary warrior king and adventurer? Due to a series of bad life choices and personality flaws he lost his position as king, having been usurped by a political rival of his, banished from Athens and dumped on an island to rot, having lost everything he had ever had. To add insult to injury how does he die? The king of the island he was on, fearing that Theseus might overthrow him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">shoved Theseus off a cliff while the latter's guard was down.</a> Not exactly a death befitting a king.
</li><li> Similarly, Jason escaped his murderous uncle, was pretty much the only mortal Hera ever showed favor towards, assembled the Argonauts, made it past the sirens, found the golden fleece and gained the love of Medea, defeated Talos (well, Medea did anyway), and returned triumphantly to his home to remove his usurping uncle. And a few years later, after dumping Medea, the gods withdrew their favor, leaving him to wander around and stumbling upon a half-buried, rotting ship. He realizes it's the Argo, once a magnificent ship carrying heroes to glory, and as he sits under the prow weeping for all that he's lost, the rotten wood finally breaks off and crushes his head.
</li></ul></li><li> Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, according to the mostly-mythical early History of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a>, became illustrious for saving the Capitol from a Gaulish invasion (hence his <em>cognomen</em>). A few years later, he was accused of aspiring to kingship and was condemned to be hurled to his death from the Tarpeian rock. This story was the origin of the Latin saying, <em>Arx tarpeia Capitoli proxima</em> ('the Tarpeian Rock is close to the Capitol'), a warning that one's fall from grace can come swiftly.

<ul><li> Long before that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NikolaiVolkoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NikolaiVolkoff">Nikolai Volkoff</a> had fallen on hard times and wound up working for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDiBiase">"The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In a real-life example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> was a 16-time world champion and considered one of the greatest wrestlers ever. Between bad investments, messy divorces, and living the jet-set lifestyle character he played on TV left him seriously in debt later on in life.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> has exhibited some similarities to Flair above. Recognized as <em>the</em> icon of professional wrestling (known not just in his own industry but as a beacon to non-viewers as well just because he's so damn iconic), the 2000s have been less than kind. Divorcing his wife and the legal problems that hounded his son following an accident that took the life of the passenger in his car has seen the Hulkster looking less-than-stellar. A lot of the opportunities he's taken in the 2000s are often seen by longtime wrestling fans as desperate grabs to keep him in the spotlight and otherwise give him a recurring income flow (such as his stint on <em>American Gladiators</em> and the fact he came to WWE one night pretty much just to shill it). It's even worse when a tape about him uttering a racial slur was discovered, which caused him to be released from WWE and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">have his records there erased.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>. While not as mighty as, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>, for many years it was indisputably the #2 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> promotion in the United States. Many recognized that the company had the potential to one day compete with the WWE. Hoping to capitalize on that, they decided to bring in Hulk Hogan and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> — and what followed can basically amount to as "WCW-lite", including but not limited to: a failed attempt to restart the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MondayNightWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MondayNightWars">Monday Night Wars</a>, a massive amount financial mismanagement, much of the younger talent being pushed down the card, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">Power Stable</a> Immortal, which was basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">nWo</a>: Take 2.
<ul><li> After Hogan and Bischoff left four or so years later, the company was in such disrepair that they lost their TV deal with Spike, while many of the TNA Originals (most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>) quit when they were told they were to face significant pay cuts; in spite of A: the fact that their talents were already being misused during the Hogan-Bischoff era and B: Many wrestlers under their promotion were struggling to make the ends meet as is! Some really nasty examples: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AwesomeKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AwesomeKong">Awesome Kong</a> just wanted a raise to buy a car, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TaylorWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TaylorWilde">Taylor Wilde</a> was seen working at a Sunglasses Hut (and she was the Knockouts Champion at the time, too), Jesse Neal was able to qualify for food stamps, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim">Gail Kim</a> was only bringing in $30,000 a year for her work (garbagemen make more, with better benefits to boot), in spite of the fact that she and Kong had the highest-rated segments on the show.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a>, the original founder of the promotion, tried to buy the company back, but his offer was rebuffed since Dixie Carter's position in the corporate structure would not be as secure — he eventually ended up starting <em>another</em> wrestling promotion instead. TNA is now desperately trying to grasp the glory that was once so closely in its grasp, only to continuously fall short and be eclipsed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">ROH</a>. If all this weren't humiliating enough, PWI no longer considers the TNA World Heavyweight Championship a world title, basically declaring that to them, the company has dropped to indy status. There was a time when this company was lauded as the future of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>; today, many wrestling fans are just begging for it to be put out of its misery.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a>. It seemed like a lifetime ago when this woman was a superstar with an assured future in the Hall of Fame. The only women from her time period that could ever compare to the impact she had were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable">Sable</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a>. At one point an international sex symbol, her fall from grace has reduced her to doing <em>porn</em>. That's only scratching the surface of how much the former Joanie Laurer's life has fallen apart, and she couldn't recover from it until her death at the age 45. Ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">it's only after that event</a> that WWE finally plans to get her to the Hall of Fame.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>.

At one point one of the most popular wrestlers of the early '00s, Matt entered a downward spiral that lasted years, culminating in him faking a suicide note for cheap publicity. It utterly destroyed his reputation, to the extent that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">drug-addled younger brother</a>, who, earlier that same year, arrived at a PPV he was main eventing stoned out of his gourd, forcing the match to end in <em>ninety seconds</em> just so he wouldn't hurt anybody, was regarded as <em>more responsible than him</em>. While Matt has worked to get his life back together since then, his legacy will forever be marred by his actions. All the same, he was able to hang on to a bit of his popularity on the independent circuit, particularly as a part of SCUM and The Kingdom in ROH, and ended up regaining his popularity after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> gave him a second chance.

Then he won the United States Championship in 2007 and held on to it for quite some time, even getting some clean wins while still being a heel - which encouraged him to become even <em>more</em> arrogant. Then, in the summer of 2008, he began losing every match and continued his losing streak for the rest of the year; this led to him being denied the trademark inflatable tunnel through which he entered arenas. MVP finally starting picking up some wins in January 2009, resulting in a face turn.

However, in doing so, they spent too much money, and after losing their champions league place to Newcastle United, they were forced to offload players to recoup debts.

</li><li> One of the greatest examples of this in modern American politics is the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey">New Jersey</a> Governor Chris Christie. Highly popular and effective after being elected in 2009, he cruised to reelection in 2013 and was considered an early favorite for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. However, after being implicated in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee_lane_closure_scandal">Bridgegate scandal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, his image was heavily tainted, to the point he ended up one of the first candidates to drop out of the running, and (at least according to Christie himself) this is also why Donald Trump didn't select him as a running mate or cabinet selection, despite throwing support behind Trump almost immediately after suspending his own campaign.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32lbe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note32lbe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32lbe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The fact that Christie was the federal prosecutor who sent Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner's father to prison didn't help him, either.</span> After this, he spent the remainder of his term of office only growing more and more unpopular with his constituents (such as when he publicly attended a beach closed to the public during a government shutdown). Ultimately, he left office one of the least popular Governors in state history, and merely being associated with him caused his Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno to lose the subsequent election in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Landslideelection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Landslideelection">landslide</a>.
</li><li> Alex Jones, a radio personality from Texas who for years made a living shouting (literally) out conspiracy theories. When the internet took off, he created a website called Info Wars which also focused on conspiracy theories and made several documentaries and he allowed most of them to be watched for free on the internet. He was one of if not THE leading force in pushing the 9/11 conspiracy theory among many others. By the 2010s, Alex Jones became huge, becoming a multimillionaire through his work and sponsors he gained over the years. Then it started to fall apart when Alex Jones accused genuine victims of crimes as being fake crisis actors, verbally attacking anyone who disagreed with him in a manner that incited violence, which sometimes his supporters would create, and that is just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">mild stuff</a>. Then it was revealed that he was going through a divorce with his wife and a custody battle for the children. During the hearings, Alex Jones' lawyer admitted that Jones is an actor playing a role and really doesn't believe anything he is saying. His wife claimed he was unstable and dangerous. Not long afterwards, Jones started getting sued by many of the victims of tragic shootings, who he claimed were crisis actors and frauds. On top of that, Alex Jones began supporting Alt-Right personalities who repeated many of his conspiracy theories for their personal agendas. This eventually resulted in Jones getting banned from many of the top social media sites, including Facebook, Youtube, and more. There was a small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">Hope Spot</a> for Jones when he was able to hold on to Twitter because according to them, he didn't violate any rules. This changed in September 2018, when in a public confrontation with politician Marco Rubio, Twitter banned Jones for breaking the behavior policy. Jones still has his website and an audience, even getting interviews on various social media websites he's been banned off, but comparing his current state to his peak shows a definite fall indeed.
</li><li> A lesser version of this in American politics would have to be former President Bill Clinton. Throughout the 90's, 2000's, and the early 2010's, Bill Clinton was an absolute magnetic draw for the Democratic Party, despite his impeachment over Monica Lewinsky, managing to play major roles in helping the Democrats take back Congress in 2006, and playing a major role in Barack Obama's reelection in 2012. Despite increasing concerns over the effects of some of his policies, (though Clinton had cleared the way on some of them by admitting he made the wrong call, such as his decision not to intervene in Rwanda), he was still widely respected and maintained a considerable approval rating. However, in the mid 2010's, concerns about the effects of his 1994 crime bill, and whether or not his gun control law went far enough (at the time, Clinton's bill was incredibly progressive, and it played a partial in his party losing Congress, not to mention he risked losing in 1996 over it) led to his legacy beginning to be considerably questioned, even if there was no questions about the man himself. The 2016 election and the rise of Donald Trump, along with the candidacy of Bernie Sanders, led to many people beginning to look back at his free trade policies with more questions, as to whether they really were as good as he promoted them. The fact that Trump used allegations that Clinton committed sexual harassment and assault before and during his presidency as a shield against his own actions led to many Democrats, especially the party's liberal wing starting to wonder privately if they had done the wrong thing in standing by Clinton during Monica Lewinsky. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeToo">Me Too!</a> movement, which revealed the widespread abuse of women in American society, was the final straw, as many Democrats, both from the liberal wing of the party and moderate lawmakers, along with a large amount of the press, even among those who had backed him during impeachment, openly admitted that Clinton either should have resigned over the affair with Lewinsky conceding it was an abuse of power, or that the Senate acquittal vote should not have been as large as it was. The effects of his policies have been even more open; all of the Democratic presidential nominees pledged at least a partial repeal of the 1994 crime bill and a reevaluation of free trade. This even extended to election campainging; Clinton was completly sidelined during the 2018 midterms, as an overwhelming amount of Democrats admitted that the allegations of sexual assault and harrasment leveled against Clinton made him too toxic to be seen anywhere near the party, especially after they kicked Al Franken out of the Senate over sexual harassment allegations, and the 2020 Democratic prrimary had not a single candidate even try to seek Clinton's endorsement.
</li><li> As a video game company, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> can count as this. When it started, it was one of the best and more well-known video game companies, creating classic series like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a></em> amongst others, having extremely strong arcade presence, and eventually became well known for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> franchise. Come 2010's, however, there has been a change in upper management, in which they decided to focus on either pachinko or mobile gaming, avoiding AAA games, something that their flagship series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> is best known for. It culminates in them abusing their employers to increase their chances of venture towards pachinko, abuses the <em>Metal Gear</em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a> until he resigned and then barred him from getting awards for his last game, all of which did <em>not</em> endear the fandom towards Konami. To rub the salt in the wound, shortly after all these happened and they looked as if they could move forward to pachinko, Japan itself, without realizing what's going on, passed a law that practically would curb profits from pachinko, meaning that they had to actually reduce the profits from their venture. And thus, Konami had to return to video game-making, after they have practically made themselves be known as an unforgivable devil of video game companies in a lot of fans and lost a lot of their manpower there that they could no longer make quality or well-received games again, even if they carry on their franchises' big names (their only successful franchise that didn't attract bile was a soccer simulation, <em>Pro Evolution Soccer/Winning Eleven</em> series), the only thing they could receive an okay reception was when they do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationReRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationReRelease">Compilation Re Release</a> of their classic titles (but even they had enough sense not to touch <em>Metal Gear</em> again for this). Looking at the past Konami and comparing it to the present day Konami may end up generating feelings of this trope. Just about the thing that stayed in the hearts of people was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">their cheat code</a>, which is usually unused these days.
</li><li> Earlier, Atari was by far the absolute king of video games. Having made its name (and really built the entire industry) with the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pong">Pong</a></em>, its Atari 2600 console dominated the industry and it put out far more games than anyone else. But Atari's refusal to change its business plan (lose money on consoles and make it back selling games) as the industry changed around it with the introduction of new consoles and personal computers cost it much business. Its refusal to allow the game designers to be credited for their work caused the best programmers to leave and found Activision. Finally, poor decision making and rushed schedules for the home port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ETTheExtraTerrestrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ETTheExtraTerrestrial">the adaptation of blockbuster film</a> caused them to release (and overproduce in hopes of selling consoles) what are considered two of the worst video games in history and usher in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatVideoGameCrashOf1983">The Great Video Game Crash of 1983</a>. Millions of cartridges were returned and ended up crushed and buried in a New Mexico landfill. Atari's frontline failure cause a 97% reduction in sales across the video game industry. Its computer division failed soon after and Atari never had another great success in consoles, despite releasing the handheld <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariLynx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariLynx">Lynx</a> and fifth-generation system <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtariJaguar">Jaguar</a>, neither was a success due to hardware disappointments. After going through a breakup and selloff of the company, it was restructured into a game design company. While it has had several successes, it has never gotten anywhere near the top of the pyramid it once built.
</li><li> Pablo Escobar was one of the most powerful drug lords of all time, with his vast fortune and army of hitmen allowing him to essentially make himself <em>de facto</em> ruler of Colombia, by bribing or killing anyone in the government who opposed him, all while living a life of luxury. Eventually, however, the tide turned against him as anti-corruption forces did manage to come to power and start cracking down on his cartel. With the aid of both the American government and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMilitia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMilitia">Vigilante Militias</a> formed from the loved ones of people killed in Escobar's reign of terror, the Colombians chipped away at his power base, killing or imprisoning all his allies and sending him on the run, eventually reducing him to hiding in a small apartment with only a single bodyguard. At this point, he was tracked down and shot dead while trying to flee across a roof, with his corpse then being used as a showpiece for a victory picture by the soldiers who'd killed him.
