</p><p>This goes further than individual death. Absolutely anything horrible can happen in an Alternate Universe — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">life-threatening plague</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWorld">being taken over by evil</a>, or completely destroyed — and our Earth will still be safe, if we can close the portal. Many heroes will not leave the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Planetville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Planetville">Planetville</a> of the week until its problems are solved, but for the Alternate Universe, all they care about is getting out alive.
</p><p>The reason for this is that an Alternate Universe often feels like a cheap copy of our own. It's just an extra us, so its people aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniquenessValue">unique characters</a>. Under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLawOfMetafictionalThermodynamics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLawOfMetafictionalThermodynamics">Second Law of Metafictional Thermodynamics</a>, that makes it expendable. It is extremely rare for so much as a single refugee to escape a doomed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>, because that refugee will ruin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastSpeciation">Cast Speciation</a> for the Earth-1 version unless the refugee will become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a>. In-universe, this is often simply pragmatism from the characters: Works that feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">alternate universes</a> heavily often use the "infinite variations" model of the multiverse. The leads simply can't afford to worry about saving every single possible universe.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Things are even worse if there's only one world, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> can change it back and forth.

</p><p>A related issue is that too many alternates can cheapen established stories. If the heroes have saved Earth from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetLooters">Planet Looters</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear">Circus of Fear</a>, that's impressive. If there's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> for each one of those villains winning, it means our heroes aren't impressive — they lost as often as they won, and we're from the universe where they just happened to win five times in a row. This gets even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> when there are <em>infinite</em> alternate universes; for every event in "our" universe, there are infinite others in which it didn't happen...

</p><p>This callousness doesn't apply to worlds that are less obviously mirrors of our own. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Wonderland</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">Narnia</a>, and dimensions with only nonhuman life are all technically alternate universes, but they're so different that losing them actually hurts.

<ul><li> Either averted or played straight (depending on how you look at it) in the anime/manga series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">With every Humongous Mecha battle, an alternate reality that is strikingly similar to that of the universe of the main characters is simply wiped out of existence. The aversion is that the characters <em>do</em> acknowledge the consequences of doing this, and many of them are quite traumatized by it. Played straight in that, well, they end up doing it anyway. For the most part.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noein">Noein</a></em> plays with this. All the Dragon Knights believe that universes outside their own are somehow virtual and unreal, Haruka is arguing with them all the way, and Karasu is the only one who's convinced/realizes that the "virtual universe" thingie connected to a real universe rather than creating an artificial existence. In the end, it's up to Tobi to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">drop the anvil</a> - that peoples' existences are confirmed by interactions and specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfFriendship">bonds</a>, not by observing a collapsing waveform.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration">Super Robot Wars Original Generation</a></em>:
<ul><li> An inversion and subversion. A group of heroes fleeing their own universe after a coup against the corrupt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">Federation</a> fails, and they try to rebuild their powerbase in our universe. They get several things right, but are surprised when several major things that happened to our universe just didn't happen in theirs. The subversion lies in their belief of recruiting the heroes of OUR universe to help them at any cost, and the main characters treat them as important as any other person. However it's hard to say if this really counts, because aside from one main female characters' alternate counterpart who is so radically different they don't even know it's her until the end of the game, the rest of the alternate universe characters are all people that don't exist in the main universe, or at least have never appeared in story there. It's hard for the main characters to write Axel off as "oh it's just an alternate Axel Almer" when they don't know of any other Axel Almer.
</li><li> <em>The Inspector</em>, the anime adaptation of <em>Original Generation 2</em>, plays the trope a bit straighter; Beowulf, already established in the games as the parallel version of Kyosuke Nambu, goes from merely being Axel's unseen arch-nemesis to being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series who mercilessly slaughters his world's version of the SRX Team in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpening">Cold Opening</a> of the first episode.
</li></ul></li><li> The anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DualParallelTroubleAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DualParallelTroubleAdventure">Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure</a></em>, which features two parallel universes, take this to the ultimate extreme by having the characters seemingly view themselves as more important than everybody in BOTH worlds. At the end of the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kazuki and Mitsuki Sanada accidentally merge the two universes together into one new universe during an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveBothWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveBothWorlds">Save Both Worlds</a>. Only the main characters remember the events of the show; to be fair, the merger was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseEnoughTimeline">Close-Enough Timeline</a>, and attempting to reverse the change was beyond the abilities of the cast.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> (Disappearance) Kyon had to destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nagato created</span>, to recreate his own Universe.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Cell comes from a timeline different than that of Trunks or the regular timeline. While the regular timeline and the one Trunks is from are eventually saved, no one seems to ever care about this third timeline and after awhile it's simply forgotten.
<ul><li> Somewhat justified. The implication of Cell arriving in the main timeline is that people on Earth in that timeline are already dead (because Cell killed them before traveling) or alive and well (because the Androids were killed by Trunks, forcing Cell to kill him and came back in time to find them instead).
<ul><li> All the Z Fighters are dead in that "forgotten" timeline as Cell killed the Trunks from it. So it <em>is</em> justified as the main protagonists of the story (with maybe the exception of Bulma and side characters like Chi-chi) are gone. Additionally, due to how time travel works in <em>DBZ</em>, the only person who could travel to the third timeline is Cell himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted with Future Trunks' timeline: while most of the characters are dead thanks to the Androids, it's treated as no less important and the Cell Saga even ends with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Episode</a> that shows him destroying the evil future versions of Androids 17 and 18 and Cell, bringing peace to his world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then played heart-breakingly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> where the inhabitants of Trunks' timeline are slaughtered by Goku Black and Future Zamasu, then the entire parallel universe is erased from existence by Future Zeno in order to destroy Zamasu's immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> form, erasing even the souls of those in the afterlife.</span>
</li><li> Seemingly played straight but then averted with <em>Super</em>'s Universal Survival Saga. The premise is that 8 of the 12 universes fight in a battle royale for their survival; the losers are erased from existence and the winning universe survives and gets a wish on the Super Dragon Balls. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's averted as the winner, Universe 7's Android 17, uses his wish to bring back the erased universes. The Omni-King(s) were actually expecting the winner to subvert the trope's mentality as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> on part of the multiverse's mortals; if any of them made a "selfish" wish, then every other universe, including the ones that didn't compete, would've been erased as well.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The central conflict in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a> Rei</em> is about this. At first, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rika</span> is willing to do ANYTHING to get back to her 'own' universe without even contemplating the morality of it, up to and including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">matricide</span>. Then as she relaxes a little bit and lets herself become a part of the universe she contemplates the good parts of it and why it could be wrong to regard her original universe as a universe A and the one she's currently inhabiting as a universe B. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a> typical of the series, she ends up committing an unspeakable sin to get back home anyway, only after acknowledging the meaning of it enough to be truly scarred by it. Sure, another characters tells her 'it was all a dream,' but it was rather probably an attempt at comforting through deceit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AsuraCryin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AsuraCryin">Asura Cryin'</a></em> spends a good deal of time getting us acquainted with the main universe of the show, though it's hinted early on there's another one. When several characters from the main universe (which is actually World-2) are killed off, the show changes gears and goes to World-1. While Tomoharu knows he doesn't belong here, an effort is being made to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveBothWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveBothWorlds">Save Both Worlds</a>; they're both considered equally real, though there's still only one Tomoharu between them.

Thus, he believes that any action he takes in pursuit of this goal — up to and including mass murder — is inconsequential since everyone killed will be alive and well once the timeline is altered.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Comic books have lots of alternate universes, from the DC comics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld">Elseworlds</a> and "imaginary stories" to Marvel creations like "What if?" and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelZombies">Marvel Zombies</a></em>. Almost every one of these ends with a bucketload of corpses, or maybe the entire universe getting destroyed. It's not our Wolverine, we don't care if this one dies.
<ul><li> This is even more blatant in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> stories. The cover of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DaysOfFuturePast">Days of Future Past</a></em> boasted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies">"In This Issue</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Everybody Dies!"</a>. It was true: Everybody did die, but in the dark future that wouldn't come to pass if our heroes in the present succeeded.
<ul><li> Except it was revealed that time travel in the MU just splits off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">alternate histories</a>, so the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> timeline <em>still happened</em>, just not in the mainstream books; the attempt <em>didn't</em> save the DOFP X-Men.
</li><li> Subverted in <em>Paradise X</em>, in which a number of heroes go to immense lengths to save alternate universes (though some prove unsalvageable). The only thing they won't do is travel into the past to reset a universe, since this will just create another alternate (stranding the people they were trying to save). It pays off—even archvillain Annihilus from the Negative Zone is willing to help out, out of gratitude for the assistance.
</li></ul></li><li> Marvel at least makes a small concession to this trope, in that the 'main' universe is Earth-616, implying that it is just another one among many. DC, on the other hand, traditionally had its main reality as Earth-1, implying it to be the real world that all the others are merely copies of. Since their latest multiverse shakeup, however, the main world is now New Earth, with 52 numbered alternates in existence.
</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s <em>Earth 2</em> graphic novel; when the Justice League discovers the existence of an alternate Earth run by villains, Batman flat out says it's not their problem but later changes his mind.
</li><li> Similarly, the heroes of the Marvel universe are entirely aware that there's an alternate Earth out there where the Nazis won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2">WW2</a> and are turning the whole planet into a concentration camp. (First revealed in <em>Excalibur</em> back in the 1980s.) No one seems to care enough to do anything about it, not even Kitty Pryde, who is a first-hand witness, and Jewish.
</li><li> Related to this trope is the general deactivation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a> - no point maintaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> when nobody's ever gonna come back, after all. For whatever reason, this seems to hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> particularly hard; if he appears in an issue of <em>What If?</em>, there's about a fifty-fifty shot that he'll get killed off, depowered, or otherwise made unusable.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> was a series specifically designed to destroy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universes</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>. There were so many around that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a> felt they cheapened the "real" universe, so their death was mandated. As usual, the ending is considered happy even though several universes just got wiped out, along with all 6 billion-plus people (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">trillion-plus aliens</a>) in each one.
<ul><li> The Multiverse was such a constant until Crisis that people did, in fact, care about the people in most of the more prominent universes. In Crisis itself, the death of the original Crime Syndicate is just heartbreaking; they're supervillains, but they're still part of the world, and they fight more bravely for it than anybody else does for theirs. A few of them run headlong into a wave of antimatter by the end...
<ul><li> This is rather subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a>, as those who saved the single remaining universe decide that they saved the wrong Earth. Infinite Crisis is all about trying to stop these former heroes from re-writing the world in their mold. They nearly succeed.
</li><li> The Multiverse was brought back at the end of Infinite Crisis, because of the temporary return of the Infinite Earths caused there to be too much aspects to return which made it impossible for New Earth to return to its original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a> state. Because of the events of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a>, Infinite Crisis' immediate sequel, fifty one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">fifty-two</a> were now radically different from each other. People were happy about this... until Countdown to Final Crisis came along and destroyed one earth (but not its universe), and destroyed a universe so utterly that it had to be rebuilt from scratch. Then a deadly mutative virus permanently altered all life in that same rebuilt universe. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Grant Morrison</a> has officially stated that Countdown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDisContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDisContinuity">never happened</a> (minus Earth 51 being destroyed which is what caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a>).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the Pre-Crisis era, DC Comics struck a balance between readers not caring about alternate continuity characters and the need to maintain the status quo of its mainstream continuity characters with its Earth-Two continuity. Under DC's multiverse system, Earth-Two was DC's original continuity from before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> of the Silver Age. Since the Earth-Two characters were the original pre-reboot versions of the characters, it was expected that readers would still care about them since they weren't from some throwaway continuity. However, since the Earth-Two characters had been displaced by the reboot versions of the characters, there was less need for DC to maintain the status quo for the Earth-Two characters since they had the reboot versions to maintain the status quo. In the Earth-Two continuity, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and the Flash all got married and Batman was later killed off.
</li><li> Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">the Dark Multiverse,</a> which takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. The story goes that long ago, there was a cosmic system intended to quality-assure the creation of new universes. Those which were inherently flawed or damaged would be melted down and recycled before life even evolved: only stable universes would get to live on. However, the entity in charge of all this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APupilOfMineUntilHeTurnedToEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/APupilOfMineUntilHeTurnedToEvil">murdered by his apprentice,</a> and suddenly the flawed universes formed a multiverse of their own: these universes were still unstable, and therefore, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">would always inevitably break down in one way or another.</a> The result is that <em>every story</em> set in the Dark Multiverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">ends with the destruction of all life,</a> whether it's through Batman becoming the next Joker, Blue Beetle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticization">converting everyone into OMACs</a> or killing them, the Black Lanterns wiping out everyone except Sinestro, or Lois Lane becoming Superwoman and wiping out the Earth to avenge Superman's death. Naturally, the characters in these universes consider themselves as valid as any others, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkNightsMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkNightsMetal">and then they tried</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkNightsDeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkNightsDeathMetal">to get out...</a>
</li><li> In the comic version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wanted">Wanted</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonists</a> jumped to other dimensions with the specific purpose of stealing things (such as an irradiated condom) and killing superheroes. While they were there they felt perfectly free to trash other realities to make their own go the way they wanted (of course, as supervillains they would have no such compunctions).
</li><li> Usually subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em> comics in that the title group (who have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> capable of traveling between realities) are more than willing to move into other realities and tell the locals how things should be done - Or Else!
<ul><li> They do show respect for other realities at times, usually as long as they're run right - or if the Authority wants their help. In one instance they had to temporarily evacuate the world's entire population to other realities, and are seen negotiating with The Meritocracy, their gender-flipped counterparts in a gender-flipped reality. (They in turn put the decision to a worldwide vote rather than decide for themselves, resulting with a majority agreement from that world's people.)
</li><li> On the other hand, in one arc they destroy an alternate Italy and in another they cause the death of everyone on an alternate earth trying to power their ship.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a> killed off almost the entire alternate cast, with only a handful escaping back to 616, but the series still had a cult following and Marvel eventually acceded to demands that Blink be brought back, meaning that <em>someone</em> must have cared.
<ul><li> 2013's <em>X-Termination</em> appears to have killed off the AoA reality for good.
</li></ul></li><li> On a Post-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ZeroHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ZeroHour">Zero Hour</a></em> encounter between every possible version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> and the Time Trapper, the heroes criticize the trapper for toying with their histories, claiming they're not variants but people.

Not only is every universe except his own perfect world expendable, but he believes he comes from the only real universe, and everywhere and everyone else in the multiverse are just fictional characters. Ergo, its perfectly okay to kill them, because theyre not real, and he is.

He mentions it only in passing, showing just how emotionless and amoral he's become. This also makes the trope justified later when the Dead Universe collapses; the only important thing about it is that Optimus Prime and his team escaped in time, but only because everything there is already dead.

While Willow once claims that she has adopted this philosophy after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she slightly ascends to kill Adria and is banished to another universe by the other Ascended</span>, in reality she was just pretending not to care about this reality to put the First off-guard until she could contact the Asgard for help getting home.

Several alternate timelines where Frisk acted differently are visited, all of which except the Pacifist timeline are far worse than the main one, whether because Chara reignited the Human-Monster War and it <em>didn't</em> fizzle out, or because Frisk is a psychopath who enjoys killing monsters and returned to the Underground to finish the job, or has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> and kept the monsters trapped and in anarchy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz">For the Lulz</a>.

He also brings warriors from nasty timelines to more peaceful ones.

<ul><li> The 2001 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOne">The One</a></em> is about an interdimensional criminal who's been going through every universe and killing his counterparts to steal their lifeforce, and is down to the last one (ours). Grave consequences are implied if there's only one of one person in the multiverse. Notably, this is a rather constrained multiverse: it is explained that every time a sun turns into a black hole (or something like that) a new universe is created and so far this has happened 125 times. At the very end of the movie, the villain is sent to the "Hell Universe" which serves as a jail for all the others... there's an entire universe dedicated to being a prison system. No mention of the original inhabitants or what became of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack3">Men in Black 3</a></em>: Griffin is an alien capable of seeing all timelines at once, though he's not certain which one he's in. This means that he's often fretting whether or not this is the timeline that something disastrous happens based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">minor actions that seem insignificant to others</a> (such as Boris being delayed at traffic lights or Kay leaving a tip for pie).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cube2Hypercube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cube2Hypercube">Cube 2: Hypercube</a></em>: A group of people are trapped in a giant maze of interconnected cubical rooms which also has distorted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienGeometries">Alien Geometries</a> and intersecting parallel universes. One character eventually becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">violently insane</a> from the stress and hunger. He solves his food problem by repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">hunting down and eating</a> alternate versions of the people in the hypercube.
</li><li> Played with in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateContinuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StargateContinuum">Stargate Continuum</a></em>. The team gets sent to an alternate timeline where the stargate was lost at sea and the SGC was never founded. When they suggest that they use the stargate to travel back in time and set things back the way they were, the alternate universe Landry chews them out for thinking they had the right to alter the lives of every human on the planet. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They wind up having to do this to save Earth by the end of the movie anyway; it just took a year or so for a suitable threat to turn up.</span>

When Bruce shows up in the past to take the Time Stone from the Ancient One, she refuses, as it will doom her branching universe to extinction.

She initially refuses, since they could die before they have a chance to put the stone back, but she accepts it once she hears that her successor, Doctor Strange, is the one who made the plan possible.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> novel <em>Test of Metal</em>, bolas at one point uses clockworking to attack Tezzeret with a massive swarm of undead copies of himself from timelines where he lost the fight. Later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tezzeret says that he can forgive Bolas despite an oath to kill him because he did kill him, over and over again.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s "All the Myriad Ways", actually deals with an inversion - because billions of new alternate worlds are created every second (every time anyone makes a choice, even such a minor choice as what color socks to put on, or even to put on socks at all, a new universe is born; multiply that by the billions of people on the earth, and...), people no longer value their <em>own</em> lives, because they know alternate versions of themselves will do better if they die — and why <em>not</em> commit murder, rape, robbery, or suicide, if you were always destined to do so in at least one timeline? The story ends by showing nine very different outcomes to the same story with only the last line changed on a whim of the protagonist.
<ul><li> In the story collection of the same name, this is followed by an essay where Niven explains his dislike for the concept of "infinite divergent worlds", reasoning that it essentially nullifies free will, as no one can really choose any action if, in the bigger picture, they choose <em>every</em> action.
<ul><li> L. Neil Smith has named this "Niven's Fallacy", pointing out that you are the only one you have. Only your choices count, since you can only live one life, in one universe at a time. Your perspective is of a single existence at a time, and your actions shape that existence from your perspective. You are you, your double is someone else - if you had done something differently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelTenseTrouble">you wouldn't be you</a>, you would be someone else looking back, asking a different set of questions. Thus, while Niven says that infinite Expendable Alternate Universes for every decision means that they all cancel each other out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFatalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFatalist">there is no such thing as free will</a>, Smith says that they in fact mean that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiNihilist">each of an individual's decisions is proof of godlike power</a>, as each of them creates <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">a different universe for each to inhabit</a>.</em>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Avoided in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones">Diana Wynne Jones</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Chrestomanci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Chrestomanci">Chrestomanci</a></em> sequence, where events in alternate Earths do affect events in the main character's world (which isn't ours, and isn't World One, either. Nor is our Earth - we're World 12B.) However, saving a life from another world can throw the whole system into disarray if you're not careful... so any traffic between the worlds has to be carefully regulated.
</li><li> While several of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s novels and stories happen in alternate or subjective realities, the best is arguably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheManInTheHighCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheManInTheHighCastle">The Man in the High Castle</a></em>, where a native of a universe where the Axis won WWII discovers an alternate USA (and also reads of a third) where they did not. None of these is our universe. Another is <em>Eye In The Sky</em>, where a group of people each gain control of reality as they individually wake from a coma. Reality in this case is according to prejudice and their wishes, rather than an alternate, but the idea of decisions causing the change holds true.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sterkarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sterkarm">Sterkarm</a></em> novels by Susan Price, amoral tycoons are quite happy to strip-mine the past for natural resources via time-travel. They don't care that by so doing they'll screw up the future, because it's only possible to get to the past of an alternate "dimension", and therefore it's not <em>their</em> future.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>, in which Lu Tze tells Sam Vimes that despite there being multiple alternate timelines, and a theory that states everything which could physically happen <em>must</em> happen in one of them, there are nevertheless events which haven't, such as there being no parallel universe in existence where Sam Vimes <em>as he is now</em> has killed his wife Sybil, showing that individual choices do matter.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em>, Sam's PDA somehow gets switched with one from a different timeline. He's horrified as he realizes that, if he had made the wrong choice at the wrong time, a lot more people would have died. Including Vimes himself: "Things to do today... Die..."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms">Men at Arms</a></em>, Pratchett all but says at the start that there were a lot of coincidences and lucky breaks that made the novel's happy ending possible—and then notes that in most universes, it didn't happen that way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cuddy and Detritus didn't fall through the weakened street. Or Edward d'Eath didn't do anything with his rage, and just nursed his grudge alone.</span> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropicPrinciple">In a million universes, this was a very short book</a>."
</li><li> It's a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordsAndLadies">Lords and Ladies</a></em>, where the weakening boundaries between the Discworld and Fairyland are also causing the boundaries between alternate realities to weaken, enough for the protagonist Granny Weatherwax to remember the lives of her alternate selves. Realizing it helps her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">figure out how to Borrow a swarm of bees at the climax</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBeamPiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBeamPiper">H. Beam Piper</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paratime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paratime">Paratime</a></em> stories, the home timeline carefully guards the secret of inter-timeline travel and takes advantage of resources from less developed (or completely uninhabited) timelines. The Paratime Police suppress gross exploitation such as inter-timeline slave-trading, but the bottom line is that Homeline's interests come first.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithLaumer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithLaumer">Keith Laumer</a>'s works:
<ul><li> After Piper and before Turtledove, there's the <em>Imperium</em> stories, where the "Maxoni-Cocini drive" allows access to parallel timelines - but at the risk of destroying one's home time-line in an unspecified chrono-nuclear disaster. In fact, our Earth is in the middle of a Blight made up of timelines where the M-C drive went horribly wrong.
</li><li> Laumer's <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.webscription.net/10.1125/Baen/0743435273/0743435273__18.htm">Dinosaur Beach<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> explores parallel time and the Timesweepers who have to clean up the messes left by previous time-travelers while fighting off others who don't want the extant lines cleaned up.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a> has made a living off of this trope. All of his books, aside from fantasy novels, deal with this trope in some way (and most of them are pretty good) but the most blatant is the Crosstime Traffic series, in which eponymous company has solved our earth's Malthusian troubles by developing "Chronophysics" and the technology to go to parallel worlds. Although this mostly gives him license to drop modern teenagers into period pieces, as the books are obviously written for teenagers, and they are pared down from his normal book length, forcing him to sacrifice the plot and world development which is omnipresent in his best works.
<ul><li> By the way, the Crosstime Traffic series is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to Piper, as the names of the people who developed the technique in Turtledove's stories are clearly based on those who developed the Paratime technique.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalisman">The Talisman</a></em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> and Peter Straub. When flipping between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universes</a> of our Earth and The Territories <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and others at the end</span>, someone will switch minds with and take over the body of their double from that universe. ...unless they don't have one (as is the case with Jack, the protagonist), where they disappear from their home world and appear in the other.
</li><li> Comes up in the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldGates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldGates">World Gates</a></em> trilogy by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HollyLisle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HollyLisle">Holly Lisle</a>, especially when one character talks to the fellow that was her husband, only he's a still-alive version in another universe.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfAmber">The Chronicles of Amber</a></em> series has the Amberites treat the "shadows" as less valuable than the "real" world containing Amber. How <em>much</em> less valuable? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Caine</a> murdered one of his alternate selves and dumped the corpse in Amber as part of faking his own death. He was one of the "good" guys. And they also think little of recruiting hundreds of thousands of shadow-dwellers as cannon fodder for their civil wars. To be fair, the "nothing but us is real" mentality starts to unravel a bit once the main characters figure out that their own world isn't exactly the "prime universe" as they've been lead to belive - and attitudes towards Shadow-dwellers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityDrift">seem to be at their most sociopathic early in the series</a>, with most of the major characters softening a bit as time goes on.
</li><li> In his novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADarkTravelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADarkTravelling">A Dark Travelling</a></em>, alternate worlds are referred to as "bands", and three of them have become dystopian "Darkbands". The protagonists find themselves caught up in an attempt to liberate a Darkband, with the end result being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a splitting of the band into two new ones, one free, and one where the liberators failed and were killed, as the battle went both ways. The main character expresses a desire to visit his own grave when that band is liberated.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is the premise of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekMyriadUniverses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekMyriadUniverses">Star Trek: Myriad Universes</a></em> series of novels from Pocket Books, exploring various "what-if" scenarios in the Star Trek universe. This is also the premise of the first novel in the <em>Crucible</em> trilogy, <em>Provenance Of Shadows</em>, which explores both the aftermath of "City on the Edge of Forever" and an alternate universe where McCoy <strong>did</strong> save Edith Keeler and Spock and Kirk never came back for him, leaving him stuck in the alternate past forever.
<ul><li> The <em>Myriad Universe</em> novella "A Gutted World" is a good example of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> attitude to alternate universes. By the end of the story, the entire main casts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> are dead. So is <em>the entire Klingon homeworld</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novel, <em>Q Squared,</em> the crew becomes concerned that exposure to alternate universes will cause people to become sociopathic, referring to the phenomenon as "Niven syndrome." This ends up inverted: the only character we see going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> does so from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">revelation</a> that he <em>only exists in one possible universe</em>, having been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">killed off in every other one to allow his wife and best friend to get together (and even in his universe, his son dies towards the same end result).</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregEgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregEgan">Greg Egan</a> plays with this a few times.
<ul><li> His short story "<a class="urllink" href="http://everything2.com/title/The+Infinite+Assassin">The Infinite Assassin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" deals with this from the inside: the protagonist is remarkably uniform between worlds, so he can leave one world, complete his cross-universe mission, and return to a completely different set of bosses who'll nevertheless recognize him. His sense of identity is correspondingly diffuse: "I am the ones who succeed."
</li></ul><div class="indent">And I wonder: in how many infinite sets of worlds will I take one more step? And how many countless versions of me will turn around instead, and walk out of this room? <em>Who exactly am I saving from shame, when I'll live and die in every possible way?</em>
</div><ul><li> If that's not mind-boggling enough, check this out: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the protagonist's ultimate defeat</span> involves being blasted into "Cantor Dust". If your victory condition has been mathematically restricted to a nowhere dense subset of the space of all universes, then you can win in one, you can win in many, you can even win in an "uncountably infinite" number of universes. But that's still an infinitesimal subset, meaning you've been defeated in "100% of <em>all</em> universes".
</li><li> This is actually <em>weaponized</em>, for lack of a better term, in the novel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Quarantine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Quarantine">Quarantine</a>. In a future when neurological mods can be implanted to alter the workings of the brain, a pair is developed that will A) suppress the user's ability to collapse wave functions by observing them and then B) let them choose from among the infinite possible timelines which one will become real. A person using it can do anything they want, as long as there's even the slightest possibility of it actually occurring. Break locks by picking random combinations, navigate through a crowded room unseen because everyone happened to be looking the other way at the same time, walk through walls via quantum tunneling effects.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Anathem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Anathem">Anathem</a></em> mixes this in, at the end.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertReed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertReed">Robert Reed</a> likes this trope. In a more straight example in his novel, <em>Down The Bright Way</em>, there are thousands of alternate Earths, each of which started diverging around the time apes started becoming more intelligent. In <em>Mere</em>, a race of aliens has quantum sized structures in their brains that cause them to see a faint "aura" around some objects, which they interpret as being glimpses into alternate universes. Hyperfiber in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatShip">Great Ship</a></em> universe is an extremely durable material that gains its strengths from spreading any damage and energy over hundreds of alternate dimensions, making it nearly impossible to destroy.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures">Doctor Who New Adventures</a></em> novel <em>Blood Heat</em> subverts this; after bringing peace to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> where the action of the novel takes place, the Doctor reveals that because it's an artificial timeline generated from the 'real' universe, it's siphoning energy from the 'real' universe that will cause the original one to end billions of years prematurely unless he destroys it. This does not stop him from feeling great guilt at the very real lives he is being forced to end in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>, nor his companions from angrily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">lashing out at him for this</a> when he tries to justify it with this trope for their sake. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Later novels in the series reveal that an old enemy of his created the artificial universe precisely to put the Doctor in this position.</span>
</li><li> Played with in Simon Hawke's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TimeWars">Time Wars</a> series book <em>The Pimpernel Plot</em>: After the time commandos effective wipe out an alternate universe by retroactively preventing the event that accidentally created it, Colonel Forester deliberately invokes this trope by asserting the people in the alternate universe were just potential people, little more than ghosts who never properly existed in the first place, because otherwise they'll have to accept being the worst mass murderers in history.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter">Stephen Baxter</a>'s <em>The Time Ships</em>, the Time Traveler is horrified at discovering that he's changed history by leaving the account of his first travels (published by H. G. Wells as <em>The Time Machine</em>, of course) even though the world he's averted is the horrible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of Morlocks and Eloi. He's so distraught he tries to prevent himself from inventing the machine, which of course goes horribly wrong. Fortunately it turns out that he's creating alternate universes, not destroying history.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastMage">Last Mage</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverts the trope</a> with a whole continuum of differing universes, none of which the protagonist (who, like his alternates, is charged with protecting only one) considers expendable.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that a future book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> will invert this — an alternate universe version of Harry has a habit of summoning himself from other universes to act as fall guys when he needs to fake his death. The future book will include him summoning "our" Harry.

<ul><li> The protagonists live on "Earth Bet", regarded as something of a hellhole by the inhabitant of "Earth Aleph" (albeit an interesting one to some people) because they suffer frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">supervillain-induced disasters</a> that kill lots of people.

Averted in Season 8 when the deaths of everyone on Earth 2 is treated with the appropriate depth. In particular, the episode focuses on Laurel's grief over the loss of her entire universe and everyone she loved. The Monitor on the other hand treats the destruction of Earth-2 as a "necessary sacrifice", showing little regard for the lives lost and simply warning that it was just a taste of what the Anti-Monitor is capable of; the only person who could or would treat the loss of an entire universe with such detachment is a godlike being who has an infinite number of universes to consider.

The heroes from the main setting of Earth 1 always consider Earth 2 just as legitimate as their own world, but the opposite isn't true as Earth 2 super villain Zoom takes to sending other Earth 2 villains to Earth 1 to kill the Flash. Several of them start out by tracking down their own counterpart and killing them, and even one who's explicitly stated to have never killed anyone before has no problem pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">Kill and Replace</a> on her counterpart to escape Zoom (though she's horrified when she accidentally kills someone else instead).

</li><li> In the follow-up episode "Doppelgangland", the heroes have no problem with returning Vampire Willow to her own universe rather than staking her, even though she's killed people there in the past and fully intends to continue killing people once she gets back, apparently it's okay because she's not hurting anyone from our Buffyverse and Willow thinks she's kind of cool. She ended up being staked by Wishverse Oz almost immediately after returning to her universe, but the heroes had no way of knowing that would happen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> Almost every <em>Star Trek</em> series had at least one episode where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> produces a horror world, and everybody dies fixing the problem, but then our world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snaps Back</a>, so all is well. (For instance, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "Yesterday's Enterprise" and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> episode "Year of Hell".)
</li><li> A downplayed example, where the death of an alternate is treated as acceptable but still tragic, is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "Parallels". A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> rips a hole in time, and five billion plus Starships Enterprise need to get back to their home dimensions. This takes place in a second (for lack of a better term) universe where Riker is captain, and he leads the effort to fix the hole. Then a third Riker tries to stop him — the third Riker is crazed, from a horrible universe where the Borg have conquered the galaxy, and doesn't want to go back. The second Riker has his <em>Enterprise</em> fire on the third, intending to dissuade it, but the travails of the third ship had already done such a number that even a light shot blew it apart. Riker wasn't happy. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a> that ended the episode was effectively a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>, and while Worf retained his memory of it, it effectively didn't happen.
</li><li> Seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>. A time-space hiccup causes there to be two Voyagers in the same place at the same time drawing off the same power source. One of the Harry Kims is killed (and one of the Naomi Wildmans dies not long after being born), so the other Voyager sends their Kim and Naomi to the functioning ship before self-destructing to take out an invading alien force. Naomi and Harry's status as alternates is never mentioned again. This is somewhat an inversion of the trope, since it is implied that the destroyed Voyager is the "real" Voyager of the series! (though this, too, is never again mentioned)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, there is an episode where Time Travel Disease keeps sending O'Brien forward in time to see himself die. (See: O'Brien Must Suffer). He goes to great lengths to save himself each time until the disease kills him, at which point Alternate Timeline O'Brien goes back in his place to save the station. In a subversion of the main trope, Alternate O'Brien feels very bad about Regular O'Brien's death.
</li><li> This becomes a plot-point when Odo prevents an alternate reality from happening to save Kira. In doing so he wipes out an entire human colony of eight thousand people who have evolved from the descendants of the <em>Defiant</em> crew.
</li><li> This gets reversed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em>, where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> character makes it clear that he considers <em>his</em> universe the "real world" and the heroes' universe as expendable.
</li><li> Downplayed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> episode "Mirror, Mirror". Kirk cares enough about the denizens of the Mirror Universe to try and convince the crew of the Mirror!Enterprise, and especially Mirror!Spock, to give up their violent and authoritarian ways, but it's still treated as less important than returning the trapped crew members from his home universe.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Five Years Gone" is set in a dark future with a high body count, none of which will matter if our heroes prevent the dark future from happening.
</li><li> In season two, Peter visits a future where <em>93% of the population</em> is dead. That is, the human population. Of Earth. The planet. This is made worse by the fact that Peter's girlfriend is abandoned there when his powers deposit him back in the 'present'. So he attempts to save her by stopping that future happening. In Season 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peter's apparently forgotten that she ever existed...</span>
</li><li> Season 3 introduced <em>yet another</em> possible ugly future which contains, among other things <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hiro's (apparent) death at the hands of his best friend Ando, Claire killing Peter, and a redeemed Sylar cratering Costa Verde (and killing Matt's future wife in the process) when his own son is killed and he loses control of Ted's powers. Also the mass proliferation of super-people has the Earth primed to <em>EXPLODE</em></span>, But none of it has happened <em>yet</em>. Neither will it happen, since that future is dead as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> We seem to be locked on target for Five Years Gone, however...</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Oh, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>...
<ul><li> In the alternate universe seen in "There But For the Grace of God", the Goa'uld actually succeed in conquering Earth and killing the counterparts of SG-1 (except for Teal'c, who never defected from Apophis in this universe). (Teal'c got to die offscreen when the base was programmed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructMechanism">self destruct</a>.)
</li><li> As an exception, "Point of View" had "our" team travel to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> to help stop the Goa'uld invasion of Earth (although they still did it only after they found out that the alternate Samantha Carter couldn't stay in their universe). Although, oddly, this episode, while not following the trope, does explicitly state it. Teal'c (rather nonchalantly) kills his alternate, and when he's questioned about it by his (incredibly freaked out) teammates, he doesn't hesitate to matter-of-factly state "ours is the only reality of consequence". While this seems unusually callous of Teal'c, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> may be relevant: he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>, so he would be particularly willing to kill a version of himself who was still guilty of what the "real" Teal'c was trying to atone for.
</li><li> The episode "2010" sees the SG-1 of the year 2010 (ten years in the future of the time the episode aired) come up with a plan to erase their timeline, despite having defeated the Goa'uld with the aid of their allies the Aschen, because they've learned that the Aschen are sterilizing ninety percent of Earth's population to make Earth their slaves, with the Tau'ri lacking the resources to oppose the Aschen on their own and concluding that the only way to stop them is to prevent this alliance from ever being formed in the first place.
</li><li> "Ripple Effect":
<ul><li> Alternate Dr. Frasier (who somehow only popped up in one of the 20+ SG-1 teams along with Carter's snake-brained love-interest Martouf; both are dead in this world) comes from a version of Earth where the Ori plague was still ravaging the world and a cure was still unfeasible. Alternate Frasier outright demands that her reality be taken seriously by Stargate Command, and she receives help (their cure) from them.
</li><li> The episode does also follow...or perhaps invert the trope: one of the other SG1 teams is planning to sacrifice "Earth-1" to save their own Earth. Technically, the other SG-1 wasn't planning on sacrificing Earth-1. They just wanted to save <em>their</em> Earth by getting the prime universe's ZPM, figuring that a three-week ride on the <em>Daedalus</em> instead of an Earth-to-Atlantis gate wasn't too bad (SG-1 of the prime Earth argued that the ZPM was also needed to power the city's shield and other defences, but their alternates weren't that bothered about that).
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the audiobook "Gift of the Gods", which revealed that Daniel Jackson from "our" universe was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> before the episode "Fair Game" and replaced by an alternate universe counterpart.
</li><li> The main role of O'Neill's friend Major Kawalsky is to die in every single timeline, whether they find it or create it with time travel. (Except for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Point of View", the aforementioned exception to this trope, which is the only one where he survives</span>.)
</li><li> In the season 10 episode "The Road Not Taken", Carter and her counterpart in another universe are experimenting with an ancient device simultaneously. Something goes wrong and our Sam is transported to the other side. The other Sam wasn't so lucky. No one from the other side seems too upset about this, whereas our SG-1 is extremely worried for the duration of our Sam's absence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>
<ul><li> Subverted in "McKay and Mrs Miller"; the techies have no qualms doing great damage to an alternate reality until they find out that life also exists in it (a chance that was considered astronomically small).
</li><li> Subverted in "The Daedalus Variations"; the team is stuck on an alternate reality <em>Daedalus</em> which is jumping through different realities. In one reality, an unknown alien race starts attacking Atlantis. Sheppard insists on intervening convinced that this reality's Atlantis are still the "good guys". It leads to the aliens attacking them as well, but the alternate Atlantis helps so it works out. Played straight with Ronon however. Teyla at one point wonders if her dead counterpart had a child as well only for Ronon to say worrying about every single reality's Teyla and her child is pointless.
</li><li> The penultimate episode, "Vegas", is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateRealityEpisode">set in a separate alternate universe</a> where Sheppard is a CSI-style detective in Las Vegas hunting down a rogue Wraith that somehow got to Earth. However, before the Wraith dies, it transmits a signal throughout the Multiverse shouting Earth's location. The Alternate!Woolsey's response to this is that it's pointless to worry about saving every possible universe and is sufficiently pleased to have prevented the invasion in his own. Unfortunately for the primary versions of the cast, the message makes it to their universe, setting up the finale.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders">Sliders</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show both avoids and endorses this trope through its first two seasons. Despite an agreement not to interfere with the worlds they arrive in, the Sliders tend to get involved in local politics and generally try to make things better. Unless they are on any kind of doomed world, in which case they typically just try to survive until the jump, unless the apocalypse will come before the wormhole, in which case they're destined to stop it.
</li><li> They also show a great deal more concern when one of their doubles dies, and have at several points considered staying behind to "fill the gap", before being talked out of it by the others (usually Arturo).
</li><li> As the series went along, things became more polarized overall on this subject. Season 4 has Quinn refer to his home Earth (the one the show started at, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not the one he was born on</span>) as 'Earth Prime' constantly, and many episodes focus on how "wrong" a world is when X happened instead of Y (like episode 2 of that season, where they encounter a world focused on religion instead of technology. Because all of the science didn't somehow predate their modern technology, it was somehow backwards... all somehow gathered from a glance at a newspaper). This is the same season that introduced a massive cross-reality war between mankind and their Cro-Magnon ancestors.
</li><li> Strangely, only two worlds seem to have produced Kromaggs. Both times alongside humans. In one case, the humans ended up kicking the Kromaggs out and, when the Kromaggs obtained sliding tech from an alternate Quinn (the one from the pilot), they start on their interdimensional conquest. The other world has Kromaggs treated like second-class citizens with an underground movement to help them.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mickey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IChooseToStay">decides to stay</a> in the parallel universe, replacing his counterpart Ricky, instead of going home, because he feels he can help make this world better. (And because his alt!grandmother is still alive.)
</li><li> And Rose is considered to have as much of a "happy ending" as she can without the Doctor — her mother and father are reunited. Only it's the parallel counterpart of her Dad — the home version is still dead, and the local version of her mother is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">not around for various reasons</a>.
<ul><li> The season 4 finale confuses things once more by having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose</span> make a herculean effort to contact the Doctor to warn him of a crisis that threatens <em>every</em> universe. The Doctor's world isn't so far into crisis as the alternate one, where "the stars are going out". By the end, a reshuffle has taken place: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mickey's granny is revealed to have died, and he and Rose have concluded their unfinished business; so he returns home. The Doctor's almost-clone goes with Rose and Jackie to the alternate universe.</span> Meaning that there's a character in the alternate universe who is - sort of - the counterpart of a character in the Doctor's universe, even though he originates from the Doctor's universe himself. Confused?
</li></ul></li><li> The original series also subverts this by having the Doctor traumatized by seeing an alternate Earth being destroyed in the story "Inferno".
</li><li> Done with an alternate timeline, but still averted in "The Girl Who Waited". Amy is stuck in a faster time stream, and when the Doctor and Rory break into it to rescue her, 36 years have passed leaving her old and bitter. They realize they could yank the younger Amy ahead to their time, but rescuing her would cause Old!Amy to cease to exist. Old!Amy refuses to help them, being unwilling to "die" and feeling after all this time she <em>deserves</em> to rescued. She and Rory demand the Doctor find a way to save both versions of Amy, which he does. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then it turns out that was a lie, only one can be rescued. Old!Amy is left behind to be erased (the Doctor considers her to be a worse person than Young!Amy), an act that is both heartbreaking and paints the Doctor as unrepentantly manipulative</span>.
</li><li> The Original Series episode "Pyramids of Mars" has Sarah Jane asking the Doctor why they have to risk their lives to save Earth in the past, since they both know Earth is just fine in the present. The Doctor answers her question by bringing her back to the present... and opening the TARDIS door to reveal the wasteland the present will be if they don't stop Sutekh in the past. So they go back and stop Sutekh, and the wasteland present never happens, but the Doctor and Sarah remember it.

She comes from a timeline inadvertently created when the Doctor left a piece of laser gun technology in Colditz Castle in the middle of World War II, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistoryNaziVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistoryNaziVictory">giving the Nazis the push they needed to win the war.</a> The Doctor manages to fix his mistake and correct the course of history...but Klein's now stuck in the main timeline, and sees her timeline as the "correct" version which the Doctor meddled with and altered. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Then she gets hold of a time machine.</a> <em>The Architects of History</em>, in particular, raises the question of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">what makes the Doctor's meddling different from Klein's:</a> a lot of his qualms about killing and collateral damage are shrugged off when it comes to Klein's universe, since it's not "the real one" anyway.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em> subverted this trope: Early in the show's run, one episode featured in a throwaway <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> where everyone's personalities were swapped: Herc was an evil despot, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">sidekick</a> Iolaus was a cowardly jester, Ares was the God of Love, etc. Many seasons later, after Iolaus had been killed off, Herc wound up with mirror-Iolaus, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">developed into an actual character</a>.

<ul><li> Lexx actually has two parallel universes co-existing as equal halves, one "Light" (rigid fascist order) and one "Dark" (chaos - the one our Earth is in). They aren't actually duplicate timelines of each other, so this trope probably shouldn't apply.

While traveling the dimensions (almost all alternate versions of the past <em>Kamen Rider</em> shows), Decade instead befriends the other Riders and helps them solve potentially world-shaking crises before moving on.

Because of our Walter's action, which has also caused fissures in reality and mass casualties in the parallel universe, Walternate felt this way about OUR side, and used his position as Secretary of Defense to prepare for a war with it. Most of the third season is spent with episodes switching between universes, enabling the audience to gain sympathy for the parallel universe while believing that only one universe can survive, until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the season's final episode shows that the opposite is true - the survival of each universe is <em>dependent</em> on that of the other, and if one is destroyed the other will ultimately fall apart as well, so they have to work together and learn to trust each other</span>.

</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarthFinalConflict">Earth: Final Conflict</a></em>, Liam and Augur have a shuttle accident and find themselves in an alternate universe where the Taelons are invading Earth. Human civilization has also taken a different track, eschewing large settlements and preferring to live in harmony with nature with trade centers being the only permanent places with structures. Nevertheless, they are better prepared to fight the Taelons due to millennia of conflict amongst themselves (they have energy weapons, for example). A number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> members in this 'verse are killed (including Sandoval's double Jason, who is the leader), but Liam and Augur (along with Jason's girlfriend) manage to escape. Only a few episodes mention the other universe, but it is quickly forgotten.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> introduced an evil counterpart to the main universe so whenever good succeeds in "our" world, evil succeeds in the other. Things have to be that way so the sisters can't help the other world but they continue to do good in our world knowing that means that they are doing evil to alternate people in the other.
</li><li> Canadian scifi series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Continuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Continuum">Continuum</a></em> plays this kind of loose, given that most of the characters within it don't seem to grasp their own time travel rules. Characters in the earlier seasons openly wonder if their "future" selves and families will continue to exist, or if even the ripple-effects of their mere presence in the past have already altered the timeline so drastically that their own parents will never meet. The mysterious time-traveling conspiracy from even farther in the future - known as "The Freelancers" - give a an explanation in Season 2: <em>every</em> time-travel event creates a branching timeline, co-existing alongside the original. When Cameron and the Liber8 terrorists traveled back in time, they <em>created</em> Timeline-2. This is explicitly why they are able to avoid grandfather paradoxes: Kellog's own grandmother was killed in Season 1, but he didn't wink out of existence. This was because it wasn't really <em>his</em> grandmother from Timeline-1, but an exact duplicate made along with Timeline-2. Thus it is <em>impossible</em> for Liber8 to prevent the rise of the corporate-ocracy in Timeline-1: all they can do is prevent it from rising in Timeline-2...which wouldn't even have existed in the first place if they hadn't traveled in time. It is also difficult to impossible for Cameron to return to her own son in Timeline-1's 2077.
<ul><li> This isn't entirely perfect, though, as killing the guy who invented the time machine you used to get there <em>will</em> create a time paradox. In the Season 3 premiere, Alec from Timeline-2 travels back in time a week to save his girlfriend's life, creating Timeline-3. If the Freelancers are correct, he didn't "save" the original, he simply created an exact duplicate...along with a duplicate of <em>himself</em> from one week in the past, who proceeds to become his rival for an entire season (both debating which has more right to claim their identity). Because Alec goes on to invent time travel, removing himself from Timeline-2 is an unsustainable paradox - his younger self can't be "killed" (removed from the timeline) with a time travel machine he hadn't even invented yet. We actually see Timeline-2 and Timeline-3 briefly coexisting, before Timeline-2 <em>collapses</em> and everyone in it dies.
</li><li> ...then it turns out that the new Timeline-3 future is even worse than Timeline-1: Liber8 didn't succeed in stopping the corporations from taking over world government, only weakening them just enough that the fighting stalemated, eventually degenerating into multi-faction anarchy, so that the alternate 2030's are a hellhole of constant warfare...in which Kellog is a major faction leader. Basically, anyone who wants to change their own timeline cannot, but if you just want to create a new timeline/universe where you can live like a king by abusing your knowledge of the (alternate but similar) future timeline, that is possible - which suits Kellog just fine.
</li><li> The finale <em>apparently</em> created a final, Timeline-4 in which things worked out - though the show was forced to end quickly with a truncated fourth season, and the showrunners insisted that he planned out a longer storyarc than that.

As shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>, the timeline naturally branches multiple times following the different possibilities of human history. However, there are only a finite amount of "water" (energy) to sustain so many different timelines at once, so every once in a while (around a century or so, usually during certain important historical events) the world would use something called a "Quantum Time-Lock", making everything that happened during its usage immutable. This has the side effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches">Cutting Off the Branches</a> that strayed too far from the "trunk of the history tree", especially if those timeline branches end with humanity becoming stagnant in one way or another and thus the energy would be wasted on them.

These trees are planted by the new villains and the resumed "defunct" timelines threaten to overwrite whole human history, so our heroes travel around the world to destroy them; however, they're faced with the dilemma of having to end the lives of the Lostbelt inhabitants, but they're encouraged by one of their Lostbelt allies to continue fighting for their world's future, no matter the cost.

<ul><li> Interestingly, the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum physics can be interpreted in a way that this is how Star Trek-style transporters work. They kill you here and build a clone out of the atoms that are somewhere else. Normally, quantum physics is interpreted as only having one of each particle, but it could be interpreted as that there's multiple particles, and the alternate universes where two are swapped is just as likely. As such, there's a universe, just as likely as this one, where the atoms you're being built of now made you up before. You're effectively being transported to an alternate universe where your atoms are already there. Alternate you gets transported to this universe by the same method.

Upon realizing that the many-worlds hypothesis must be in effect, present-Chex fixes this problem by killing his past self.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Narbonic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Narbonic">Narbonic</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> device is powered by harnessing all the energy in, and in the process destroying, alternate universes "where they probably don't want to exist as much."
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goats">Goats</a></em>, when one character discovers that the "simulations" he's been running and deleting are actually <em>real universes</em> (at least as real as the one he lives in, which is also being run on a computer somewhere) being destroyed, and immediately has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>, moaning that he is the worst mass-murderer in history.

Most of the main cast knows the truth, but have accepted her as part of the family; even if a few would rather believe that she returned from the dead than she's from another dimension.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ToSaveHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ToSaveHer">To Save Her</a></em>; even though there are many, <em>many</em> parallel universes, Altenates of the same character are deliberately treated as separate people, even when the alternate of a dead character steps in as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> of the original.

The main characters are surprisingly apathetic when they set up their TV to view alternate universes, and discover most universes end with one of them causing Armageddon. (It being a filler-guest story made in cut-and-paste style may have had something to do with this.) This is averted, however, during the "Aylee" and "That Which Redeems" arcs, where Torg tries his hardest to save alternate versions of the Sluggyverse; the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Zoe from the Dimension of Lame</span> is actually one of the saddest moments in the series, and profoundly affects Torg from there on out. Then again, there was the Punyverse... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it blew up, all of it, and it was a very remote reality with no obvious alternative versions of anything in the usual dimension, but they got away and just didn't care, presumably because it was such a stupid place and impossible to take seriously.</span> To be fair, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The punyverse was being destroyed by an atomic chain reaction.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneralProtectionFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GeneralProtectionFault">General Protection Fault</a></em>: the rest of the cast thinks Trudy is actually her counterpart from the "Emperor Nick" universe. That Trudy switched with "the real" Trudy, to give the latter a chance at true redemption. (So what they think is a new Trudy is actually still the old Trudy)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> is all over the map with this one.
<ul><li> When Karkat realizes that the demon who showed up from another universe and destroyed his game session was actually an alternate-universe version of Jack Noir, the Derse agent who helped him overthrow the Black Queen, Karkat says he feels betrayed even though he knows they're technically separate people.
</li><li> When Dave travels back in time to prevent some bad decisions that doomed his timeline, he gets annoyed at being called "the other Dave" or any implication that he's not "really" Dave. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture">Meanwhile, in the doomed alternate future</a>, the readers actually see his doomed timeline blink out of existence. Rose, at least, survives this event in a fashion by merging with her past self.
</li><li> Later, Aradia pulls the same trick as Dave about a couple hundred times, and ends up with an army of alternates of herself from doomed timelines. The alternates know beforehand that they're doomed to premature death—it's one of the laws governing time travel in paradox space—and they're okay with this because Aradia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">completely emotionless</a>. When all of the clones do get slaughtered, her friends don't seem terribly concerned about this, mostly because they have bigger problems to deal with than the philosophical implications of time travel clones.
</li><li> Getting back to Dave: Due to weird time shit, he occasionally encounters corpses of himself from alternate timelines, and he's more creeped out by this than his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a> facade will let him admit. When Terezi tells Dave that he can achieve god-tier power by killing one of his doomed-timeline clones—who, as above, is doomed to die somehow, anyway—Dave refuses to do it. Then Terezi breaks down crying after seeing the doomed Dave die, even though alpha timeline Dave is still alive.
</li><li> When we get a look at the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> afterlife, we see that doomed-timeline alternates—Dave, Aradia, and a doomed John—are also there, and their souls are separate from their alpha timeline selves. This has created some weird moments, such as when John learns that his doomed timeline self dated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vriska</span> and she treats him with flippant familiarity, even though this John never got to know her too well. Then, later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a dreambubble is destroyed, killing all of the dead alternates in it</span>, which the fandom did actually respond to with genuine sadness.
</li><li> The fandom was actually pretty sad to hear that the alternate Rose and Dave from the post-Scratch universe were dead, even though the main timeline Rose and Dave are still fine.
</li><li> The trope was turned on its head when it was revealed that the universe that had been considered the primary one for well over three years was actually a doomed offshoot. Cue a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a>, and the few survivors escaping to the <em>true</em> primary universe.

<ul><li> In fact, later <em>Transformers</em> materials have indicated Unicron is a multiversal constant—one of the few things that is unchanged in the entire multiverse. If he is destroyed in one universe, that's fine—he still exists in the others. This doesn't prevent them from messing with each other, though—in Marvel's G1 comic, the Unicron of the Marvel continuity plucked Galvatron from both the future and an alternate universe to serve as his herald—presumably since Megatron, in that reality, was dead, and <em>that</em> Galvatron (and Unicron) had <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">succeeded</a></em>.
</li><li> And the British comics go further then this by also having <em>another</em>, much stronger, Galvatron from a different future who came back in time to kill Unicron. He abandons this plan when he accidentally changes history and realizes that, since he continued to exist, he was just in an alternate timeline. This is a slight justification to Galvatron not caring about the fate of a universe that wasn't his own though; he's a bit of a jerk and more than a bit mad.

When the Planet Express crew arrives in an alternate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">palette swapped</a> universe, they argue with their counterparts over whose universe is Universe A. ("Why do we have to be 'B'?" "This place kinda feels like a B...") Eventually they decide on the names Universe A and Universe 1. Also both Benders genuinely care about their perpendicular universe counterparts, because if there's one thing Bender loves, it's Bender.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Narrator:</strong> Meanwhile, in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun. ...A.
</div><ul><li> In <em>Bender's Big Score</em>, Professor Farnsworth and the Harlem Globetrotters discover a law of physics detailing how the universe protects itself from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeParadox">time paradoxes</a>: It arbitrarily kills any clones created via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>. This happens several times over the course of the film; some clones are mourned more than others.
</li><li> In "The Late Phillip J. Fry" a time machine that can only go forward in time takes Fry, Bender, and the Professor further and further into the future, until the universe they knew dies out and a new universe, completely identical to the old one, comes into being. They consider this a completely acceptable substitute for the real thing. This is actually an inversion, since it portrays the original universe as expendable and the original Leela was shown missing Fry and being miserable for the rest of her life, but Fry isn't particularly concerned because he just continues off with the new identical Leela in the new universe. It's also partially played straight in the Fry, Bender, and the Professor kill their counterparts upon arriving in the new universe and aren't particularly concerned (though given the previously established paradox rule that duplicates cannot co-exist, this may have been inevitable).
</li><li> That being said, it wasn't entirely clear if the new universe that restarts after the end of the last one is actually "new", or a reboot of the original copying over itself. So it isn't clear if our "original" Leela actually died alone missing Fry, or if that future never occurred, because original Fry traveled so far into the future that he went full circle and came back to the present.
</li><li> There is also an episode where the crew takes Fry on a tour of the Universe and its tourist attractions. One is a scenic outlook to a parallel universe. The difference? Everyone in the parallel universe is wearing cowboy hats. When Fry asks about there being an infinite numbers of these parallels, he is told that there is in fact only one parallel to their own. His response is that's probably enough. It's also why the alternate universes mentioned above are referred to as "perpendicular" rather than parallel in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">DVD Commentary</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show had an inverted version of this: in an alternate universe where Lex Luthor kills The Flash, Superman returns the favor, and the Justice League becomes the "Justice Lords," a totalitarian force that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">ensure peace and justice by suppressing dissent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">lobotomizing</a> former villains. When they find out about the series' main Earth, they decide to head over, incapacitate the Justice League, and "show them the light". The Justice League's response is a pure embodiment of this trope: they depower the Justice Lords and apparently stick them in prisons on the Justice League's Earth. So much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">for</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero">that</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsAlwaysDoomed">world</a>. (They still have their Batman, though. They'll be fine.)
</li><li> Averted in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a>. Before traveling back in time to stop Vandal Savage's plan to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> the team warn Alternate Batman that:
<div class="indent"><strong>J'onn J'onzz:</strong> You understand that if we do change the past, you — this version of you — will never have existed? <br/><strong>Alternate Batman:</strong> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Nothing</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">would make me happier.</a>
</div><ul><li> The crowning irony of this statement is that alternate Batman was 'created' by Vandal Savage murdering his parents instead of Joe Chill. How he would feel if he'd known they'd be murdered either way is never revealed, because none of the league have the heart to tell him. On the other hand, AlterBat seems to be saying, <em>"I risk my life every day fighting Alternazis. Death was always a possibility. <strong>Go get the bastards!</strong>"</em>
</li></ul></li><li> There's also an episode where Superman is seemingly killed (in fact, thrown into the far future), and without him the Justice League fails to stop another plot by Vandal Savage. This doesn't turn out the way Savage planned and instead wipes out nearly all life and hideously mutates the rest - except for Savage himself, who is immortal. After living alone for centuries in the literal hell on Earth he created, Savage comes to regret his villainy, and teams up with Superman to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">prevent himself from defeating the Justice League</a> by sending Superman back in time. Superman asks the heroic version of Savage what that means for him, but he considers that an acceptable sacrifice. Once they succeed, the heroic Savage contentedly fades away, assumably leaving only the usual supervillain version.
</li><li> In the not-officially-related <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueCrisisOnTwoEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueCrisisOnTwoEarths">Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths</a></em> when Batman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> Owlman learns that every time anybody anywhere makes any kind of choice, a new universe is created for each possible option chosen, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he decides that not only do other universes not matter, neither does his own, because any choice he makes is meaningless. After all, in another universe he automatically made a different one. He resolves to destroy Earth-Prime to destroy the multiverse, viewing it as "the only possible <em>real</em> choice" anyone could ever make. Batman manages to send both him and his bomb into an actually expendable universe where Earth has become a frozen wasteland devoid of all life</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the underrated and at-times quite creepy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPanAndThePirates">Peter Pan &amp; the Pirates</a></em>, one episode has Peter and the gang entering an alternate universe where copies of Peter Pan, Wendy and the Lost Boys are slaves, toiling endlessly to prevent the Corc (their version of the crocodile that Captain Hook and everyone else are afraid of) from awakening. Peter Pan et al have an adventure in this alternate universe, but are unable to save these copies of themselves from their lifetime of misery and slavery. The copies help the originals escape, and that's it.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold">Batman: The Brave and the Bold</a></em>: When a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">Depopulation Bomb</a> threatens to kill all life on Earth, Batman and Red Hood teleport it to another dimension. It turns out (as in, we find out they already knew) everyone on that Earth were already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsDeaderWithZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsDeaderWithZombies">zombies,</a> so the bomb's explosion was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegateYourOwnSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegateYourOwnSacrifice">completely harmless</a>. Additionally, this episode primarily takes place in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> world, similar to Earth-3 of the comics. Batman doesn't just want to escape this world, he wants to make it better (since, in this world, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a> is a regular occurrence). He frees the captured heroes, who are now being led by Red Hood, and the villains have been defeated. Batman only leaves when he feels like the native heroes have a good handle on things.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR">Megas XLR</a></em>, Coop ends up in an alternate reality where he destroyed the Glorft, turned evil, conquered the world, and worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">lost his gut and became ripped</a>. In an exception, the real Coop decides to take care of his evil self, only to get Megas destroyed. Instead of simply pressing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">he steals the alternate Coop's abandoned Megas, leads the Glorft against Evil Coop's forces in a final epic battle, and gets Evil Coop trapped between the universes</a>. It's as awesome as it sounds.
</li><li> Averting this trope seems to be the logic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a> lives by in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>. He repeatedly turns down the chance to return to the past and kill Aku before he could ever take over the world and gives it up to help his new friends. While this may seem stupid in that he'd negate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> so he'd never need to save his friends, it may be that he's just too kind to risk that this trope is true. Thus the best option would be to destroy Aku in the future and then return to the past and destroy him there. Ultimately, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack kills Aku in the past, which does indeed erase the future he was sent into—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">include Ashi, his lover who he met while he was there</a>. Although heartbroken, Jack concludes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">restoring the Earth</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">was worth the cost</a>. Jack's allies were implied to have felt the same, as being told of Jack's goal to erase "the future that is Aku" did not keep them from coming to his aid.</span>
</li><li> An interesting idea from the TV special <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RudolphsShinyNewYear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RudolphsShinyNewYear">Rudolph's Shiny New Year</a></em>. Father Time explains that, every New Year's Eve, a new island appears in the Archipeligo of Last Year. On these islands, "time stands still", and the world remains as it did during that year forevermore. Since this is a children's show, we get to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThemeParkVersion">The Theme Park Version</a> of a couple of years (One Million BC is depicted as a paradise of jolly cavemen and singing dinosaurs, 1776 is defined by Independence Day and Ben Franklin, and 1023 is apparently the year in which all the world's fairy tales took place), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> sets in after that. Think about it; in 1964 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> will never break up, but at the same time the Civil Rights movement will barely get off the ground. In 1944, World War II will wage forever, Pearl Harbor is still in flames, and Hitler will never die. In 2001... need we go on? And there is the implication that all the people on these islands are the same people who actually existed in these time periods, meaning that somewhere out there are multiple versions of you, one for each year of your life, trapped forever in a nebulous 12-month span, never to grow, or learn, or live on. And if you indeed weren't from the real world and merely were a reflection living upon one of the islands, how would you ever know?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>: in "Rick Potion No. 9", Rick and Morty inadvertently cause the end of the world and the former simply takes them to an alternate universe where they both died and take their counterparts' place, making this an example of an Expendable <em>Main</em> Universe. Morty is clearly traumatized by the notion that his friends and family are all doomed and he will spend the rest of his life with identical strangers. Given how nonchalant Rick is about this, it's quite clear that he considers <em>every</em> universe expendable. It's not at all clear if Rick's even originally from the universe they abandoned.
</li><li> After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Prismo</span> dies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, it's revealed that he set up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>-based gambit to reverse this that involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">an alternate Jake falling into an eternal sleep</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">an alternate Finn getting turned into a sword</a>. None of the three see any problem with this, and Jake might even be jealous of his parallel's amazingly comfortable sleeping arrangements. A later episode even shows <em>the Finn turned into the sword</em>, who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon">still talk</a>, has no problem with this (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">assuming that's not just "prime" Finn talking to himself</a>).
