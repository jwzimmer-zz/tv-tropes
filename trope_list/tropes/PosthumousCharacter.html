But this meant that she also had to abandon her two young sons, and it lead to one of them (Vilhelm) developing a pathological hatred against the growing feminist movement. He also became abusive towards his wife, his children and his niece. Beatrice eventually becomes her uncle Vilhelm's favorite victim, because she reminds him so much of his mother/her grandmother. Aurore has been dead for years when the story starts, so she can never appear "on screen". But it becomes clear that her choice to abandon her sons to become independent, no matter how understandable it might be to Beatrice and plenty of modern readers, is what turned the Löwenströms into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Big, Screwed-Up Family</a>.

</li><li> Pretty much the entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> is based on this, as all the victims are obviously dead from the get-go of any episode, and their story is filled in entirely via the flashbacks of their friends, families, enemies, etc.

</li><li> Harry Morgan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>. Unique because he's actually in the title credits and appears, at the very least, in two thirds of every season, almost always as a hallucination.

<ul><li> The most straightforward type are those characters who were dead before the series even began but have since turned up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Backs</a>. The most triumphant example is Jack's dad, Christian, whose dead body Jack was bringing home on Flight 815, but who turned up in numerous episodes throughout all six seasons, whether in flashbacks, in dreams, as a ghost, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonImpersonation">Dead Person Impersonation</a>.
<ul><li> Other such characters would include: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Susan Lloyd, Frank Duckett, Essam Tasir, Tom Brennan, Jae Lee, Yemi, Angelo Busoni, Kelvin, Emeka, Edward Burke, Tricia Tanaka, Howard L. Zuckerman, Roger Linus, Horace Goodspeed, Emily Linus, Jonas Whitfield, Isabella, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">"Mother"</a>, and Claudia.</span>
</li><li> Subverted in the case of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kate's mom, Diane.</span> In <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her</span> first flashback <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she already has a terminal disease. She</span> then appears in several other flashbacks that all clearly take place sometime before the first one. But in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a> we discover <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's still alive. "The doctors have given me a year to live for the past 4 years."</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Another unique type are among the Tailies. They would've been alive at the start of the series, but are dead by the time any protagonist meets the Tailies. Such as Goodwin Tailie, who debuted as a corpse, then went on to guest star in 4 episodes after that, each one in a flashback taking place earlier than the one before it. The only other dead Tailies named are Donald and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nathan</span>.
</li><li> Then there are those characters who died soon after their debuts only to appear in more episodes <em>after</em> they died than they ever did while they were alive. The most famous example is Ethan Rom, killed in his fourth episode, then appeared in eight more episodes after that. Other examples include:
<ul><li> U.S. Marshal Edward Mars (killed in his third episode, appeared in six more after that).
</li><li> Leslie Arzt (killed in his third episode, appeared in four more later).
</li><li> And the most triumphant example, Jacob, killed in the very first episode he was played by a professional actor. The actor went on to play Jacob in five more episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> Beginning with the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a> in the third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeasonFinale">Season Finale</a>, we had plenty of characters who were still alive in the main timeline, but were dead by the time of the flashforwards. And since the first flashforward shown is actually one of the last in chronology, this would also include people who were killed in the ffs. The most triumphant example is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> John Locke</span>, whose body is in a closed coffin in that third season finale. It's not till the fourth season finale that the coffin is opened, revealing it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Locke</span>, and not till midway through the fifth season are we shown how he ended up there.
<ul><li> Other characters who died during this period include: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">Diane of the Others,</a> Greta, Bonnie, Ryan Price, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">Tom Friendly</a>, Mikhail, Charlie, Naomi, George Minktowski, Regina, Karl, Rousseau, Alex, Ray, Captain Gault, Omar, Keamy, Michael, Neil, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">apparently every single remaining survivor of Flight 815 who was neither a</a> main character nor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">an abducted Tailie</a>, Charlotte, Nadia, Ishmail Bakir, Mr. Avellino, Elsa, Helen, and Abaddon.</span> So yeah, a few people died during this period. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">Just a few.</a>

Although his death doesn't have a huge impact on the plot, it is a driving factor behind Hawke's character, as his death essentially left them the head of the family. Malcolm is never seen, except as a ghostly pair of eyes in the <em>Legacy</em> DLC; this is because Hawke strongly resembles him physically, and Hawke's appearance can be customized by the player.

</li><li> In the episode "On A Clear Day I Can't See My Sister", Lisa mentions that Bart once comforted her when her pet hamster died.
</li><li> In "The Boys of Bummer", Lisa mentions that Bart had a rabbit named Cottontail that Homer apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">buried alive</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Other good examples are the town's founder Jebediah Springfield and Clancy Bouvier, Marge's father.
</li><li> Superintendent Chalmers's wife, Rosemary, was first mentioned at the very end of Season 16's "Pranksta Rap", with Chalmers saying she's very sick. She wasn't brought up again until Season 23's "Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts", where it is revealed that she had died.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em> series finale, "Forever Royal", reveals this as the fate for Queen Lorelei (Roland's wife before he married Miranda) and Birk Balthazar (Sofia's unnamed father before Miranda married Roland). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sofia's father was a sailor who was lost at sea. While not outright stated, it's heavily implied given how they show her mourning over a ship in the bottle while holding his hat. In the case of the queen, Roland made a wish in the wishing well from "When You Wish Upon A Well" so that they can have children since she couldn't bear any. Unfortunately, she ended up passing away since her body couldn't handle it. Again, it's not outright stated, but still heavily implied.</span>
