<ul><li> There was a cleaning ad that played with this trope. A woman is grocery shopping with her arm in a sling. She gives sympathetic shoppers a whole bunch of different stories about how it happened, leading the audience to mistake her injury for domestic abuse. At the end of the commercial, it's revealed she hurt her shoulder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutHimselfShaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutHimselfShaving">trying to scrub soap scum out of the bathtub</a>.

She actually gets them after tugging on the tails of animals she cares for at the zoo. This leads to a scene where several people follow her (completely innocent) father around and interpret everything he does as an indicator that he's abusive to her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em>. The girls of the house will think that Keitaro, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">extremely unlucky and clumsy</a>, is trying to molest/abuse them, and respond with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnprovokedPervertPayback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnprovokedPervertPayback">vicious revenge</a>.

Eri runs, as she wants to avoid Harima, which leads to the very athletic Mikoto to chase after Eri, getting her outfit slightly torn in the process (while leaping over fences, tripping, etc). When she meets up with her childhood friend Hanai, she brushes it off as nothing. Harima shows up to Hanai to return Mikoto's bag she left behind when she and Eri ran off. Naturally, Hanai thinks Harima hurt Mikoto and gets angry with him.
</li><li> A scene in an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em> has what sounds like the youngest of the main cast being beaten by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">enemy Digimon of the week</a>.

Her soul? Both belong to Ranma." Kuno promptly comes to the conclusion that female Ranma is being held prisoner by a brutish, abusive male Ranma. It's implied by Nabiki's tone, expression, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">personality</a> that she gave a poor explanation on purpose to make the situation worse.
</li><li> Another story has Ryoga catching Ranma and Akane in a compromising position. Because Ranma needs Ryoga to be in a massive rage, he gets Ryoga even more worked up by pretending that he forced himself onto Akane.
</li></ul></li><li> A scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsobiAsobase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsobiAsobase">Asobi Asobase</a></em> features Kasumi and Olivia practicing using make-up (which their school forbids) on Hanako. Since neither of them have much experience doing make-up, they fail disastrously and a teacher walks in to see the girls standing over Hanako with a black eye (eyeshadow) and a bruised cheek (rougue).

Chaos ensues.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>, social workers at school will occasionally notice Robin's various injuries and bruises, and with the truth locked down tight, who can blame them for thinking abuse? Bringing your adopted kid along to fight dangerous criminals is not something social workers would be happy about either.

Apparently, it was really loud and kinky sex because afterwards, Mina's comrades ask about all the noise. In a variation, Mina lets them <em>think</em> it was some rough interrogation.
<div class="indent"><strong>Allan:</strong> We heard that other girl screaming. D-did you torture her for information? <br/><strong>Mina:</strong> Oh... yes. Yes, I can be quite ruthless when I have to be.

After being shoved by Flash Thompson, he passes out from the pain and wakes up in the nurse's office. She tells him his whole body is horribly bruised and he's to be sent home right away. To keep his identity secret, Peter has to beg her not to send him home or phone Aunt May. After he leaves, the nurse notes that it's only because she knows the elderly May isn't capable of causing injuries like that that she doesn't report child abuse. She concludes Peter just has a tendency to get into fights and doesn't want a bad reputation to sully his academic record.

When she walks through a store, one man sees her bruises and says, "Excuse me, Miss? I know it's none of my business, but I hope the guy who did that to you goes to jail." Connie implies to Elly in the same strip that this is also the reason why her husband Greg isn't willing to be seen in public with her until the bruises heal up because of the possibility of him being mistaken for abusing her.

Though McGonagall says at the time her evidence is equivocal; Harry usually behaves like a well-adjusted boy, but sometimes behaves as if he were being abused. It's unclear whether Harry's irrational personality or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his presumed partial possession by Voldemort</span> is to blame.
</li><li> A <em>Sentinel</em> fanfiction called "Intervention" has two of Blair's students kidnap him and try to get him to admit on tape that Jim has been abusing him.

By the end of the episode, it's revealed that both situations were perfectly innocent (the girl had been playing a highly athletic game and stretched a bit too far, and the boy had osteogenesis imperfecta, leading to fragile bones, compounded by a high energy level and really lousy coordination). Notably, in both cases, the ones saying "We should contact CPS about these kids," are treated as sensible and reasonable, and the one who wants the children taken away right that second is treated as a hysteric. The CPS workers are also treated sympathetically.

The immediate idea is that the father, who got divorced from his wife a while ago and is working long hours, is abusing and beating the son.

Eventually, she learns that the woman really <em>did</em> fall down the stairs. This and the bruises were the result of her bumping into things because she was developing multiple sclerosis.

Only months later, watching one of her sisters, a doctor, examining her ill son, does she realize that what she remembered was not her father abusing her, but <em>examining</em> her, as he was a doctor as well.

<ul><li> Discussed and played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/LoadingReadyRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/LoadingReadyRun">Crap Shot</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8xivS237sw">ep. 40: The Explanation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's not abuse, but abuse is apparently less embarrassing, so they're prepared to go with that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged">Dragon Ball Z Abridged</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Goku</a> accidentally implies that he's a wife beater when he mentions how he beat her at the martial arts tournament. It should be noted that Chi-Chi is largely the one that drives their roles in their marriage, not Goku.
<div class="indent"><strong>Goku:</strong> It really wasn't much of a fight... One hit and she just went down. Then we got married, I put a baby in her, and now she just stays at home, cooks my dinner, and raises our kid! <br/><strong>Chi-Chi:</strong> Y'know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">when he puts it that way</a>...
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysWorking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysWorking">Not Always Working</a></em>, this happens occasionally.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/hot-and-not-bothering-to-listen">One story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has a waitress think that a customer's long sleeves and arm bruises are from abuse. The customer was <em>actually</em> recovering from chemotherapy.
</li><li> This also happens a lot because of racism, as people assume that if a non-white is in a relationship with/accompanying a white person, then the non-white person must be abusing the other. See <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/racism-should-have-checked-out-already">this story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/theyd-like-to-look-at-the-kidnap-menu">this one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>,<a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/driving-miss-daisy-will-drive-them-crazy">this one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>,<a class="urllink" href="http://notalwaysright.com/theyd-like-to-look-at-the-kidnap-menu-part-2">and this one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://notalwaysright.com/are-you-puli-ng-my-leg/115732/">This dog owner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> gets this from a veterinary technician. The dog in question was a Puli, a rather rare dog breed whose coats naturally form into long cords, and was a puppy during the process of forming the cords (during which time they look bad even if they're in perfect condition). The vet tech assumed that the dog was a doodle being unwittingly neglected because the puppy farm lied about how the fur works. The tech then started to give the dog a haircut... without consulting the owners. The actual vet is furious and immediately fires the tech once she finds out what happened.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/WhatTheFuckIsWrongWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/WhatTheFuckIsWrongWithYou">What the Fuck Is Wrong with You?</a></em> one of Tara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">running gags</a> on the show is the number of childhood injuries she has had to endure, either at her own hands or her sisters' hands. Her poor mother had to rotate emergency rooms with all three of them for fear of this trope happening.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em> season 7, Donut goes over to Blue base to give Caboose a message from Tucker, but collapses from dehydration. While Caboose takes care of him until he wakes up, the rest of Red team comes over to the base looking for Donut. Caboose tells them he has Donut and is keeping him comfortable until he tells him some things, but Sarge interprets all this as him holding Donut hostage and torturing him for information.

<ul><li> The very first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> has a misguided social worker suspect Hank of beating Bobby. His "evidence" includes a black eye on Bobby (actually caused by a little league accident) and an overheard conversation where Bobby and Joseph imitated Hank's tendency to deliver blustering, exaggerated threats when angry. He immediately moves to have Bobby taken away, only to have his supervisor chew him out for not getting anything more than circumstantial evidence and not even questioning the little league coach who could have cleared this entire thing up at the very start, and has him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Rough Trade" has this happen to Stan. The neighbor sees him drunken and slovenly (he was under house arrest for DUI (Roger's fault) and agreed to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwappedRoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwappedRoles">Swapped Roles</a> with Roger, who does nothing but drink and watch game shows all day) and Francine has a black eye (a stressed-out Roger slapped her) which she excuses by saying she walked into a doorknob (a common excuse). When the police come by, they find pictures of an underage boy in his underwear (Steve, he took the pictures himself on Roger's advice to impress a girl) and a basement full of monkeys (Hayley was looking after them for her animal rights group, Roger forgot to feed them), and they hear Stan angrily yelling "I'm gonna kill him!" (Roger, of course) and come in to see Francine on the floor with another black eye, saying, "It was my fault for leaving the mop out" (She tripped on the mop and <em>did</em> run into a door).
</li><li> In the episode "Let Me Be Frank With You", Francine dresses as a man to spend more quality time with an unknowing Stan. The two become best friends, but a suspicious Bullock gets jealous and finds out the real Frank is in another state. He then orders Stan to kill him. While Stan is about to, Francine/Frank lets something about Francine slip, and it causes Stan to think Frank did something with Francine. He then beats Francine/Frank mercilessly while Francine is more focused and romanticized by his loving monologue about her. Eventually, he realizes the truth and they share a romantic hug. Moments later, a man sees Stan hugging his beaten wife, apologizing for attacking her, and with a gun in his hand. He thinks something is up, and Stan threatens to shoot him. Jon Hamm then appears to give a very special message about butting into other people's business and how something you think could be something is something entirely different.

They find the house a mess (because Marge went with Homer to a day spa instead of her usual housework), Maggie drinking out of the dog's water bowl (because she could) and wearing a sign that reads "I'm a stupid baby!" (because Bart stuck it on Lisa as a prank and it somehow found its way on Maggie), Grampa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeniorSleepCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeniorSleepCycle">asleep on the couch</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">the toilet paper hung in the "improper" overhand position</a>. Marge and Homer didn't actually neglect the kids, but to the social workers, they looked like unfit parents and had to take parenting classes in order to get their kids back from their foster parents, the Flanders family.
<ul><li> The episode "Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind", Homer wakes up with no memory of the night before and sees that his family is missing and Chief Wiggum came over due to a domestic disturbance and that Marge had a black eye. Homer soon remembers seeing Marge on the couch with Duffman and believes that she was having an affair and had hit her in retaliation. As Homer is about to commit suicide, he remembers the whole story, which was Marge planning a surprise party for Homer with Duffman as hired entertainment, and the black eye was the result of trying to open a champagne bottle and the cork flying into her eye.

<ul><li> Keifer Porter abused his wives, psychologically as well as physically, and managed to convince the eldest wives, who could have divorced him, that it was all in good fun (or, in one case, that the thirteen-year-old he tortured and raped provoked him).
</li><li> Possibly, Balin Brindle is a victim of this. He is rumored to have sex with his mothers (actually aunts, who fill the social role of mothers), which is seen as damage to his reputation, but no one does anything about it, like investigate whether he is forced to do it.

Later on, we learn that he was sexually abused by the king ever since he was a child and hated the king all this time, but didn't dare fight back because the king would have killed all his friends and relatives if he had.

Veronica walks in, hears some "sex noises" from the guy, quietly says "Don't mind me", then leaves with the tickets. After Mac and Veronica return, they are too drunk to drive home so Veronica sleeps on Mac's couch. The last second of the episode is Veronica and Mac waking up to Parker's screams as she had been drugged, then raped and her hair completely shaved off her head. This grievous mistake is explored more in the next episode as well.
