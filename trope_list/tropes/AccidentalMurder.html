Occasionally, this happens because a fight just goes too far (Bob and Alice start fighting, and the fight gets more heated than anyone expects, and Alice ends up braining Bob with a heavy object or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByFallingOver">accidentally knocking him onto something sharp</a>... and she doesn't realize he's dead until it's over). Other times, this happens when innocent bystanders are caught up in someone else's fight and are dead before anyone else realizes they are there (Bob and Alice are fighting; Carol, a friend to both, tries to break it up and gets accidentally shot while Bob and Alice are wrestling for a gun). And sometimes there's no fighting involved at all; the person who dies is killed because the unintentional killer does something stupid.

No one was meant to die, but someone died anyway. The ultimate result of an Accidental Murder varies. Bob killing Carol (or Alice killing Bob) may cause him to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>, or make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> to bring her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>.

In most of the situations described above, the charge would be manslaughter, or it might not even be a crime at all, but only a fatal and unfortunate accident. Between the two exists "negligent homicide," which may or may not be the name of the crime (if any).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ns5s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ns5s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ns5s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In legalese: "Negligent"="Unreasonably violating a duty of care"="Being stupidly careless"; "homicide"="killing a person".</span> However, that makes for a less evocative title.
</p><p>There is also a curious variation of the "Accidental Murder" trope, the "Let's Immediately Become Criminals" trope, which involves either an individual or a group. The situation may actually be that there is an abundance of physical evidence and eyewitnesses to corroborate that death was unintentional. Nevertheless, in this version of the trope, it is common for the witnesses and/or the accidental transgressor to decide on faulty logic that, since they will be seen as guilty immediately, that "we have to bury the body" and/or "hide the evidence", despite the fact that in many cases such an act could be ruled death by misadventure. In these cases, trying to cover it up is (ironically) the only actual crime committed.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another">Another</a></em>, Reiko's friend Katsumi Matsunaga accidentally killed a student in his class when they were fighting during the summer trip, by pushing the kid to the ground and causing him to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpromptuTracheotomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpromptuTracheotomy">stabbed through the neck</a> with a pointy tree root (the manga has him grab a stone and whack the student over the head during the fight). The kid turned out to be the extra student that caused the Curse of Class 3-3, which made Matsunaga realize what had to be done to lift it. The tape he left hidden in the classroom would prove to be vital 15 years later.
</li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, the cast is standing on top of Zearth after the first battle after the "tutorial" when Ushiro bumps Waku, and Waku seemingly falls to his death as a result, causing Ushiro to become angry when it seems as though everyone is accusing him of murder. It turns out later that Waku died as a result of piloting Zearth, <em>and he was already dead before he fell</em>.
</li><li> Being a mystery series, it happens <em>many</em> times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>. A good example takes place when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan">Grumpy Old Man</a> Watanuki tries to push the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficeLady">Office Lady</a> Sanae away from him... but stupidly does so when they're atop of a flight of stairs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaircaseTumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StaircaseTumble">causing the poor woman to hit her head and die</a>.

<ul><li> Goku's grandfather, Grandpa Gohan was killed before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">the story</a> began. It later turns out that it was by Goku's own hands, after turning into a Great Ape. Since he never retains any memories of said transformation, he didn't put two and two together until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, when he's fighting Vegeta and sees <em>him</em> transform into a Great Ape.
</li><li> The Tournament Rules state that killing one's opponent in the ring is forbidden. If it does happen, the implication is that the fighter is not held responsible for murder, but are disqualified from the tournament for use of unnecessary force. This almost happens to Videl when she fights Spopovich in the 25th Budokai when she kicks him so hard that his head snaps around a full 180 degrees, and Videl is horrified that it seems she has killed her opponent. However, Spopovich's Majin powers allow him to survive such an injury, so it meant she didn't have a kill on her conscience... and unfortunately, Spopovich retaliated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">so brutally against her</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">his partner was seriously creeped out.</a>

However, Aki's death is still responsible for leading to Natsumi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>, which Aki herself started to go through as a result of the Hinamizawa Disaster and fear of "Oyashiro-Sama's Curse."

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em>, the rules specifically state that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a>, but also that if a fighter is <em>accidentally</em> killed in battle, their opponent won't be held accountable.

<ul><li> Also, George De Sand accidentally helped a sociopathic contestant accidentally kill <em>an entire Coliseum crowd</em>. See, the contestant was taking pot-shots at the audience, forcing George to block his missiles with his Gundam, and the president of Neo-France decided this was the last guy you'd let represent your country in the Gundam-Olympics and disqualified him. In response, the contestant decided to unleash his payload straight at the president, George grappled his opponent to save the president, but then the entire payload was misfired straight into the audience. <em>Nobody in the bleachers survived</em>.

In both versions, he's killed when he charges the Strike Gundam trying to protect his friend and teammate Athrun. In the original, Kira swings the Strike's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> and cuts the Blitz in half; in the remaster, the Blitz <em>trips</em> and falls onto the sword instead. This change rubbed many fans the wrong way, since not only did it seem stupid for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> to randomly trip, but it added to the perception that Kira is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> of <em>SEED</em>'s controversial director, Mitsuo Fukuda, and the change was made to absolve him for the original killing.

Despite the nearest Earth Master confirming the man was teetering on the edge of a stroke for years and nobody that actually knew the deceased mourning the guy, his death plagues Giselle with guilt throughout the novel and enough pressure from up the chain of command was put on the matter to ensure 'Gunther Von Weber' would hang if caught.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode involves the murder of a famous poker player known as the Candyman. Several people want to get back at him for something, but none claim to kill him. One drink server admits to putting eye drops in his drink, but only to give him diarrhea. The connection is that the Candyman's favorite table munchies were a certain type of chocolate piece made from chocolate from West Africa, where they still use leaded gasoline. Thus, combined with a bullet in his leg that had never been removed, there was enough lead in his system that he would have eventually died of lead poisoning. However, the eyedrops managed to spike his blood pressure enough to trigger the result: literal death by chocolate.
</li><li> Another episode deals with a college student who goes missing the night she is supposed to return home. It turns out she was cleaning out her dorm room, went to empty her trash, and accidentally dropped the trashcan down the chute. Knowing she wouldn't get her security deposit back if the trashcan was missing, she tried to retrieve it from the outside Dumpster. Unfortunately for her, a passing motorist just so happened to accidentally ram the Dumpster at the precise moment she had climbed up the back and was leaning into it, pinning her between it and a back wall and crushing her. She later fell into the Dumpster where she bled to death. Her body was fed unnoticed into the trash compactor.
<ul><li> Her parents refuse to listen to this explanation, convinced that she was murdered by someone. It's human nature to want to blame something (or someone) specific instead of a series of unlikely events. Grissom is actually confused by this, as facts are everything to him.
</li></ul></li><li> And then there's the guy who slipped on Jello and in the process accidentally stabbed his wife with a shard of glass.
<ul><li> Same episode, same guy. One of his neighbors saw him kill his wife. When he tried to stop her from calling the police, he accidentally ran her head-first into her phone, killing her as well.
</li><li> Same episode, same guy. During his childhood, he accidentally cut off the oxygen to his grandmother's nasal cannula (nose-tube thingy), causing her to suffocate.

</li><li> In early seasons, especially, these types of accidental slayings were pretty common. Especially when perpetrated by a guileless party, like a child or someone just going about his business. Sometimes it would cause the investigators to angst over the necessity of upholding the law despite their sympathy for the "murderer."
</li><li> A shootout in a mini-mart results in all the crooks dead. Unfortunately, an innocent bystander is also shot during the firefight. It turns out that the cop was aiming for the crook who was running and shot at him at the exact moment he was passing the bystander. The bullet hit the crook, came out the other side and killed the woman. The cop got a commendation for his actions.
</li><li> And there was the episode where an angry woman walked into a sliding glass door so hard she shattered it, and the glass pierced her neck, causing her to bleed out in minutes. Her sister threatened to blame the dead woman's ex-con boyfriend; he didn't take it well.

While everyone assumed Stinkmeaner had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a>, he turned out to just be a blind old man who got lucky.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Grojband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Grojband">Grojband</a></em> episode "Myme Disease" the townspeople kill Statue Steve because they thought he was a statue; however near the end of the episode, they realize that he was actually a statue <em>performer</em>, and a good one at that.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestTheRealAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuestTheRealAdventures">Jonny Quest: The Real Adventures</a></em>, a man and a woman were arguing and the man accidentally pushed the woman down the stairs and killed her (broken neck).

</li><li> This accounts for one of Kenny's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">various deaths</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, where Stan and Wendy uncover Bebe's deep-lying conspiracy to get free shoes. Wendy and Bebe end up fighting for a gun, and after several seconds, a shot fires out. Wendy and Bebe both back away... but neither is injured. We then cut to Kenny eating dinner with his family, when the bullet manages to hit <em><strong>him</strong></em>.
</li><li> Season 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> starts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackLightning">Black Lightning</a> accidentally killing a fourteen year old girl with a weak heart.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SolarOpposites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SolarOpposites">Solar Opposites</a></em>: Pretty much the norm for the Shlorpians, and every other unfortunate human that comes across them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsResistance">Star Wars Resistance</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsResistanceS1E6SignalFromSectorSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsResistanceS1E6SignalFromSectorSix">"Signal from Sector Six"</a>, Poe fires his blaster into the ceiling to scare off several Kowakian monkey-lizards harassing Kaz and, to his surprise, a dead one falls from the ceiling.
