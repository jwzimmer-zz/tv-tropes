</p><p>Sometimes, there is no easy choice to make. No matter what you do, something is going to go badly for someone. The choice of who to save and who to let die often falls on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, and when it does, there's only one choice to make.

However, this trope is averted nearly as often as it's played straight, especially among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti Heroes</a> who are willing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">to screw over the whole world for the ones they love.</a>

<ul><li> Gut-wrenching example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>. When Wall Maria is abandoned, there are too many refugees to feed and the food supplies look grim. The government's solution is to draft 250,000 people (20% of the population) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">reclaim the lost territory from the Titans</a>; only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">handful survive</a>. Pixis doesn't mince words about this and goes further to say that if Wall Rose falls, this time over <em>50%</em> of the remaining humans are going to be sent to die.
<ul><li> This is the justification that commanders use in this series when they sacrifice their troops (except for the ones that are just plain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Cowards</a>).

<ul><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Incubators defend their decisions to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">the souls of magical girls tortured to the point of absolute despair</a> to prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Universal Entropy</a> on the basis of humans similarly using cattle in order to eat. Also, the Incubators, by interfering in human affairs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">have brought Civilization and technology</a> to the human species at the expense of a few magical girls sacrificing themselves. In other words, the needs of both Humans and Incubators outweigh the needs of a Magical Girl. In the end, Madoka, while disgusted at the callousness of the Incubators, accepted their logic, and decided to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">sacrifice herself to absorb all Magical Girls' despair at every point in space and time</a></em> in order to save them yet allowing the benefits given by the Incubators to influence humanity. A win-win scenario on the expense of Madoka's very own existence.</span> <a class="urllink" href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Talk:Philosophical_Observations">The Puella Magi Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> provided an Analysis of <em>Madoka</em> and the Utilitarian philosophy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Shirou Emiya's</a> father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Kiritsugu</a>, possessed this principle and we get to see it in action in the prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em>. The contradiction in this ideal is also exposed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the corrupted Grail</span> when he gets shown an illusion where he has to save either the many or the few until he has killed 498 people for his two most beloved people. His alternate solution was to get access to a perfect, omnipotent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> wish-granting artifact to save everyone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unfortunately for him, even if the Grail <em>hadn't</em> been corrupted, it wouldn't have helped because the Grail is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal Genie</a> that can only provide the power to the methodology of Kiritsugu's choice, not a perfect omnipotent thing with all the answers.</span>
<ul><li> He is noted to have gone soft after joining the Einzbern family. Early in the War he bombs a hotel to kill an enemy Master but calls in a bomb threat first. In the past, he would have just killed everyone in the building to be absolutely certain his target died too. Civilian casualties weren't a concern for him, because so long as he killed his target he was saving more people in the long term.
</li></ul></li><li> The Sibyl System in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em> falls into this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Sibyl System consists of brains of criminally asymptomatic individuals that want to "perfect" society. The ideal society that the Sibyl System wanted to create involves an isolationist Japan where society is focused on pleasure and happiness. However, this involves the elimination of individuality and sacrificing undesirables from political critics, emotionally unstable individuals, students, teachers, and even farmers to create their perfect society. Akane does not like how the Sibyl System was operating (particularly the idea of <em>killing</em> people to protect others) once she found out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a>, but she still continues to work with the system because she believes that there is a better alternative to maintaining society while bringing order <em>and</em> justice at the same time.</span>
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">However, according to Touma, he exposes the irony on the Sibyl System's beliefs, as their members highly value their own unique individuality over the average citizen as they believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">they are morally, mentally, and philosophically superior to everyone else</a>, and thus they are more fit to rule society. Yet, for their value of uniqueness, they don't see the irony of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>, thus showing the irony that the Sibyl System only benefits their members and not everyone else</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a>'s refusal to do this in the S series is what enraged Uranus and Neptune near the end, as Sailor Moon couldn't stand sacrificing Hotaru to save the world (she didn't have to, but the conflict of one person vs. the world was brought up at least somewhat).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>:
<ul><li> Using this trope as a mantra is why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Simon is happy with the series ending despite the heart-rendingly painful price he had to pay to save the universe. It perfectly shows how strong and heroic Simon has become.</span> It's also extremely Japanese.
</li><li> Rossiu ends up following this trope. In the village where he grew up, the priest was willing to keep to the strict population limit of 50 by any means necesary, even exiling people to almost certain death on the surface if they ended up with too many. After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rossiu was willing to sentence his long-time friend Simon to death as a scapegoat to appease the masses, and take a small fraction of humanity into space and leave everyone else to die in order to avoid humanity's extinction</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FateKaleidLinerPrismaIllya">Fate/kaleid liner PRISMA☆ILLYA</a></em>, the Ainsworth family is willing to trade the life of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miyu</span> to save the human race. Interestingly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kiritsugu, who would sacrifice the few to save the many, Kuro, the wielder of the Archer card who carries Kiritsugu's beliefs, and Shirou, whose original philosophy was to save everyone,</span> chose to save the ones they loved at the expense of others.

This is basically the backstory of Axl RO, a minor antagonist appearing early in the work. He was drafted into the army during the American Civil war and his mission consisted of being a lookout stationed in a tree at a remote town. His job was to light a lamp in order to warn the soldiers nearby of an incoming enemy troop. He, however, refused to do so fearing that the light would give away his position, possibly leading to his capture and execution at the hands of the enemy. The troops then marched and burned the town to the ground, killing all the civilians and soldiers stationed there. Since then, Axl has been trying to find a way to repent for his sins. This is reflected by the power of his stand, Civil War, which is able to transfer or unload sin and guilt via the attacks of hostile, ghostly representations of people and objects Axl or his targets harbor as having wronged or unfairly discarded.

By dooming Mantle, he believes Atlas and the rest of Remnant can be saved. It triggers a terrible in-universe schism as the protagonists split into two factions: those who agree with Ironwood's assessment and those who don't. During their final argument in the Atlas Vault, Oscar even points out that he would technically only be saving a handful of lives with raising one single city out of reach while Salem will slaughter the millions of others left on Remnant.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is the basic principle behind <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism">Utilitarian ethical philosophy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The Trolley Problem is a thought experiment that forces the subject to choose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadisticChoice">between actively sacrificing one for the many or allowing the many to die through inaction</a>. The thought experiment involves a scenario where a runaway train is barreling down a track towards a group of five people who are immobilized, and a fork between the train and the group leads to another track on which is one immobilized person. The subject has to decide whether to toggle the switch that will move the train onto the other track and kill the person on it. The thought experiment is used in psychological studies to gauge the degree of utilitarian thinking in the test subject and how various variables such as age, sex, and degree of fatigue affects it. It also has several variations, such making the subject decide whether to personally murder by pushing someone into the path of the oncoming train, assuming that the person has the mass to stop it, to save a group of people ahead. This variation is intended to invoke more personal involvement, and experimentally fewer people are willing to take this option in this variation. Another popular variation puts the larger amount of people on the trolley itself, with the question being if the subject is willing to let the trolley crash or fall off a cliff to save one person on the other track, and many other variations include making the person on the diverted track. Other variations include making the person on the diverted track <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheOnesYouLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillTheOnesYouLove">a relative or loved one of the subject</a>, replacing the "sacrifice" with the subject's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOrLimbDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOrLimbDecision">arm or leg</a>, and even going so far as to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">the subject themselves</a> be the one on the diverted track.
<ul><li> Of course, the solution to the trolley problem is to grab it as it goes past if you're careful the groceries won't spill out. What!? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage">You said it was a trolley</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Weighing the needs of the many is intrinsic to any government decision and policy, where hard decisions have to be made to ensure the greatest prosperity and well being of society. A most direct example of this is in hostage scenarios. Acceding to the demands of the hostage-takers can potentially endanger more people in the future because the criminals emboldened by the success may attempt more hostage-takings and are more capable of having acquired the resources. Refusing will result in the death of all hostages, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Taking A Third Option</a> in trying to attack the hostage-takers is likely to get at least some of the hostages, and maybe some of the police, killed.
<ul><li> Considering the needs of the many is also present in scenarios less directly involved with life and death, such as whether to cut the funding to the senior citizen assistance programs and therefore depriving the most vulnerable senior citizens of health and financial aid, to fund infrastructure projects that will aid a regional economy.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the reasoning the Nazi party used in their propaganda to justify the sterilization of 400,000 German citizens in the period 1933-45 and the extermination of Germany's 70,000 remaining mentally ill and disabled in the period 1939-45. Interestingly, the sterilizations were not carried out by government personnel or under orders, but by regular doctors with government encouragement and approval. In fact, the Nazis had a slogan, <em>Gemeinnutz geht vor Eigennutz</em>: "The common good goes before individual good." See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">The Holocaust</a> and the article on <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktion_T4">Aktion T4<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> for more on this.
</li><li> The ultimate reason why the lower levels of warfare must always be subordinated to the higher levels - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics">tactics to operations, operations to strategy, and strategy to Grand Strategy</a> - to avoid disaster.
</li><li> This is the rationale for war and military mobilization in a War of Annihilation (<em>Vernichtungskrieg</em>), such as the Soviet-German War: better the country be impoverished and many people die than the entire people be exterminated. It can still apply to ordinary wars in which the survival of the civilization itself is not at stake, such as Germany's war with the rest of The Allies, but the cost-benefit is not so obviously clear-cut.
</li><li> On a debatably positive note, this is part of the 'logic' behind assassinating a tyrant - kill one obviously evil person (and those loyal to him) so that thousands or even millions may live free of his oppression.
<ul><li> On the other hand, Terry Pratchett noted that there's a flaw in this logic: "Shoot the dictator and prevent the war? But the dictator is merely the tip of the whole festering boil of social pus from which dictators emerge; shoot him and there'll be another one along in a minute. Shoot him too? Why not shoot everyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSequitur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSequitur">and invade Poland</a>?"
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zigzagged">Zigzagged</a> with Communism and Karl Marx. The ideology itself can be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalitarianUtilitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalitarianUtilitarian">Utilitarianism taken to the extreme</a>: the massive wealth and goods of the upper class (the capitalists) should be taken away and redistributed among the working class majority<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0de05');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0de05" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0de05');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A large majority of Europeans at that time period were lower class laborers working at textile mills and factories.</span>, for the sake of the greatest benefit for the greatest number. Ironically enough, Marx himself <em>criticized</em> Benthamite utilitarianism, stating that human nature is too dynamic to be limited to a <em>single</em> utility (hedonic pleasure) and said that Bentham failed to take into account the changing character of people. However, other communists and socialists did justify themselves on the basis of utilitarian philosophy.
</li><li> Benthamite Utilitarians have argued for animal welfare on the grounds that sentient animals are capable of pleasure and suffering, and thus their needs must be taken into account. This is rejected by Mill-type Utilitarians who adhere to the concept that Human Beings have different qualities of pleasure, including but not limited to the acquisition of Knowledge, something animals are not capable of, hence the maxim: <em>Better to be a Socrates dissatisfied than a pig satisfied</em>.
