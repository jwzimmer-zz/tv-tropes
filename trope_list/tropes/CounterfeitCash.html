</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a></em>:
<ul><li> This was the mystery of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Black Island</span> in the eponymous adventure.
</li><li> <em>The Crab With The Golden Claw</em> also starts with mentions of counterfeit coins, but this plot point is soon dropped and forgotten after the murder and Tintin's abduction.
</li></ul></li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em> story we meet the master counterfeiter Fenimore Buttercup, who would have been successful, had he not printed <em>3-dollar bills</em> and <em>signed them with his name</em>!
<div class="indent">I am an artist! Shouldn't an artist sign his masterpieces?
</div><ul><li> In <em>The Daily Star</em>, the crooked shopkeepers printing a tabloid quickly find more lucrative uses for their printing press, like counterfeiting money. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">Greeley</a> interviews the banker after the crooks are caught...
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Greeley:</strong> When did you realize the $3 dollar bills were counterfeited? <br/><strong>Banker (utterly shocked):</strong> Counterfeited? My $3 dollar bills?

After breaking down the doors and handcuffing Richie, they then discover that all of the "notes" have Richie's photo along with "Play Money" printed clearly on them.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Agent #1:</strong> "Richie didn't <em>say</em> we have to repair the doors."
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Agent #2:</strong> "You want his father to buy the mint and fire you?"
</div><ul><li> Invoked and averted again in another story where one of Richie's many uncles is highly eccentric and prints his own money, but averted when it turns out that Richie's dad has an arrangement with the people who deliver supplies to the uncle where Richie's dad will replace all of the uncle's "counterfeit" money with genuine currency.
</li><li> Invoked and partly averted in a story where Richie's mischievous cousin Reggie Van Dough prints almost-perfect fake money to use to prank people with. The partial aversion comes about because Richie has an actor pose as a treasury agent to warn Reggie that he's actually breaking the law by pretending that the notes are real, even though he intended to give the people the same value in real money later.

He starts printing fake bills, only for the FBI to burst in  but they're looking for pornography, and don't care about the cash, because "that stuff soon won't be worth the paper it's printed on."
</li><li> The brothers get in trouble in Mexico. Don Longjuan The Yaqui Brujo uses some real notes, a pair of scissors and a colour photocopier to make high-value fake notes (e.g. US$25,000) to bribe them out. By the time the fakes are detected, the brothers are well away.
</li></ul></li><li> Zig-zag: A Marvel issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a>'s <em>Dynomutt</em> has him and Blue Falcon stopping the theft of some charity money by the Zoot Suit Brutes. They apparently jettison the money, which Dynomutt recovers. Later, Blue Falcon makes change out of a $100 bill with the charity money. As Radley Crown, he and Dynomutt are at a restaurant where Crown pays for dinner with a $20. It turns out the $20—and all the money still at the charity drive the Zoot Suit Brutes jettisoned—was money the Brutes stole from a bank. Radley is unable to explain where he got the stolen $20 for fear of giving away his secret identity. Dynomutt has to do some fast detective work to clear him.
<ul><li> Similarly, a Gold Key issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> had the gang helping at a telethon which gets terrorized by a (duh!) ghost.

The bills were counterfeit as part of a press set up by the woman for whom Betty is working. When Betty and gang realize what she is being manipulated into doing, they try to trap the counterfeiters by handing over one of the phony bills, but are too dumb to suspect that the crooks are on to them when the woman inexplicably gives Betty a mere $20 bill. That turns out to be legal tender so the police don't believe their story of a counterfeiting operation when they turn it in.

<ul><li> Governments absolutely despise counterfeit currency for a large number of reasons, but the most common is the fact that counterfeiting is a dangerously inflationary action: with more hard currency in circulation, the "rarity" of said currency is diminished, and prices go up as a result (in other words, $100 is not worth as much when there's a lot of $100 bills available).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2h8xi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2h8xi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2h8xi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Something you may not know: in the United States, at least, it's perfectly legal to mint your own money. What's illegal is attempting to pass it off as money issued by the U.S. government. Thus various local currencies. Calling your alternative currency a "dollar" is asking for trouble, even if no attempt is made to <em>directly</em> copy specific US coins or bills, because it could still be perceived as trying to make people think they're US dollars.</span> Unchecked, counterfeiting can absolutely devastate a country's economy, both internally as people keep demanding higher and higher prices, and externally, as other countries will view the currency (and the country's economic backing of said currency) as essentially worthless. And even beyond the direct inflationary effect of having more currency in circulation, widespread counterfeiting will undermine the public's trust in the currency, because they'll be less confident that the money they're paid is real and not counterfeit.
</li><li> The primary function of the United States Secret Service is <em>not</em> protecting the President of the United States <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge">(that's a secondary function)</a> but investigating cases of counterfeiting and forgery. The presidential protection duty was added in 1901 because the Secret Service was at the time the only federal law enforcement agency with sufficient manpower, and anti-counterfeiting mission has been expanded to cover all manner of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteCollarCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteCollarCrime">financial crimes</a>, but the bulk of their work is still tracking down counterfeiters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> details it <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastyGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastyGold">Tasty Gold</a> trope of biting into money to check its authenticity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Back in the days of gold coinage, if the coin wasn't soft enough it had probably been alloyed with some cheaper metal, making the coin harder. On the other hand, if the coin was <em>too</em> soft, then the coin had been alloyed with lead, which actually made the coin <em>softer</em> (but again less valuable).
<ul><li> Archimedes' famous discovery happened because of this: the king wanted a way to determine whether his crown was pure gold, or whether its composition had been mixed with other shiny metals—but he didn't want to bite his beautiful crown. What Archimedes realized was that if you mix base metals into the gold, the result will occupy more volume than the same weight in pure gold (since gold is denser than most metals it would be alloyed with). Dip the item in question into water and mark how far the water rises. Dip the same weight of gold into the water. If the item is made of pure gold, the water will rise by the same level. If the item is fake, the water won't rise as far when the pure gold is immersed.
</li></ul></li><li> There was an infamous counterfeiter who was known as the Omega man. The only flaw in the coins he made was a tiny Greek letter he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">added to them</a>.
</li><li> Apocryphally a sting operation once used a machine that took in pieces of green paper and spat out perfect $20 bills. The secret, of course, was that the "green pieces of paper" <em>were</em> $20 bills.
<ul><li> This has been used as a practical joke and in "hidden camera" shows.
</li><li> Another version of the trick has the crook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatBag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatBag">selling</a> the "money making machine" to a sucker (answering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">obvious question</a> by claiming that he needs a lot of money now and the machine is too slow). When the mark realizes he's been had, he's unlikely to report his own attempt to get into the counterfeiting business.
<ul><li> In some versions, the mark <strong>does</strong> report the case... only to get more years than the seller.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> There have been artists such as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSG_Boggs">J.S.G. Boggs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who specialize in drawing the front of a US $100 bill, and then sell it as art for $100 worth of goods &amp; services. Several were investigated for counterfeiting and/or forgery.
<ul><li> Günter Hopfinger produced about 300 1.000 DM notes that way.
</li></ul></li><li> Wesley Weber and his friends made a fortune producing counterfeit $100 bills. They made so many of them, in fact, that many retail outlets in Canada would not accept $100 bills. The Canadian mint actually had to do a major redesign of the bills. As he was busted in 2001 and $100 bills aren't all that common, the style of bills he counterfeited have virtually disappeared from circulation altogether—but <em>not</em> from law enforcement classrooms, as the Weber Bill is still a test case in counterfeit detection.
</li><li> William Chaloner, a seventeenth century coiner and forger, who became the bane of Sir Isaac Newton's existence during the scientist's career as Master of the Mint.
<ul><li> Ironically, Newton's Master of the Mint post was, at the time, essentially a sinecure — a form of stipend to give him funding and spare time for more scientific work. Newton, however, took his new responsibilities seriously, and made several important innovations in minting.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OldBritishMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OldBritishMoney">United Kingdom</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.royalmint.com/discover/uk-coins/counterfeit-one-pound-coins">approximately 3.04% of £1 coins are counterfeit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> according to the Royal Mint. It was one of the factors behind the decision to bring in a new coin in 2017.
<ul><li> The Swazi lilangeni is an accidental version; despite having a different design, it has exactly the same composition and shape as a pound sterling coin. It only has a face value of around 10p (depending on the rate of exchange) and can be passed off as pound coins to people who aren't paying attention (or machines).
</li></ul></li><li> As mentioned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates">Ridiculous Exchange Rates</a> trope, counterfeiting was endemic during the Russian Civil War. The Kerenki Ruble banknotes made by the provisional government were of such laughably poor quality that anyone with a storebought home printing apparatus could make indistinguishable copies. And they did. This devalued the currency so badly that both the counterfeiters and the mints didn't bother to cut them into individual banknotes and released them as 1x1 metre sheets to save time.
</li><li> Releasing counterfeit money into an enemy country to undermine its economy is a popular war tactic. The most infamous example would probably be during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, where the Union flooded the south with millions in bogus Confederate cash (while probably deeming <em>real</em> Confederate cash equally bogus). Whether this worked or not is debatable. Most of the fake bills were instantly recognizable because they looked <em>too good</em>, but many retailers still accepted them because the Confederate Dollar was already suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates">Ridiculous Exchange Rates</a>, anyway.
<ul><li> Counterfeit Confederate bills are the only counterfeit "American" currency that it's now legal to own in the United States. Because the US dollar is one of the few currencies that has never been redenominated, none of the older banknotes have ever been demonetized. So even though a piece of 19th century counterfeit US currency that still survives would have considerable collector's value in the rest of the world, in the US it's still technically a copy of a legal tender bill and thus illegal to possess. Confederate currency however was printed by a self-declared nation that no longer exists and thus is not "real money" under US law, meaning that the counterfeit bills are both legal and highly collectible. In fact, counterfeit Confederate bills are often <em>more valuable</em> than the real thing. This has resulted in modern copies <em>of the counterfeits</em> being made. While technically this isn't counterfeiting, since what's being copied isn't considered money, it <em>is</em> still fraud to sell a modern copy at a higher price by falsely claiming it's either a real Confederate bill or an 1860s counterfeit thereof.
</li></ul></li><li> Counterfeit Money is a frequent problem in China. However, only higher-value notes tend to be counterfeited. This results with an odd situation where the <em>jiao</em> (RMB equivalent of cents) notes are much lower in quality than the <em>yuan</em> notes, their texture almost resembling counterfeited money. The idea is that the <em>jiao</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousExchangeRates">are worth so little</a> that nobody would bother counterfeiting them anyway.
</li><li> An interesting variation occurred when a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4489683/Woman">woman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> tried to pass off a novelty $1 million bill at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Walmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Walmart">Walmart</a> in Georgia. She claims that she thought the bill was real, which if true means that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">deserved what she got.</a> Not exactly counterfeiting in the traditional sense, but it's noteworthy that the novelty bills in question got pulled from stores immediately thereafter. Unintentional counterfeiting?
</li><li> In an interesting inversion, a Swedish artist coined nine 10 SEK (a bit more than 1 USD) coins, that are normally made from a gold-colored alloy, of pure gold, marked them with an almost invisible mark, and put them into circulation.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bernhard">Operation Bernhard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a secret Nazi plan during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> intended to destabilize the British and American economies by flooding them with forged notes. The plan was never fully realized and most of the forgeries were dumped in a lake. However some of the notes were used to make pay for such things as secret imports from neutral countries and payments to secret agents operating in Allied countries.
<ul><li> Originally, the plan called for the disruption of the British economy by having the commanding officer recruit engravers and other artisans from concentration camps make fraudulent bank notes. Once the mission was accomplished the head of the project was going to be reassigned to a combat position, and the prisoners returned to the camps, when he had the bright idea to sabotage the U.S. economy with fake dollar bills. However, once the Allied victory neared, the project was abandoned, the currencies sunk into a lake, and when the question as to what to do with the artisans, a subordinate brought up the idea to exterminate them, lest they tells the Allies what they were assigned to do, but the commanding officer denied that request, stating that the Western Allies and the Soviets were too close to their position, killing the artisans would result in a summary execution.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nysun.com/on-the-town/little-old-moneymaker/9282/">Emerich Juettner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> got away with counterfeiting for a decade (from 1937 to 1947) despite the poor quality of his fakes (printed on ordinary paper, with badly reproduced graphics and Washington's name misspelled) because he printed only modest amounts of fake money, because he never used the fakes at the same place twice (out of an odd personal sense of honor), and because people rarely pay much attention to one-dollar bills. (Even when people did notice, they often preferred to keep the bogus bill as a souvenir rather than report it.) His odd pattern of passing bills (much different from the M.O. of most counterfeiters) baffled the U.S. Secret Service for years. He finally got caught when there was a fire in his apartment and his equipment got tossed into the street by the firemen; he was sentenced to a year and a day of jail (of which he served four months) and, ironically, was fined $1.
</li><li> Possibly an urban legend, but according to several sources, back before the fall of the Shah of Iran, the US was helping the country modernize their currency system, supplying intaglio presses, the fancy paper with red and blue threads in, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">even sample $20 plates to show how the serial numbers worked</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PersiansWithPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PersiansWithPistols">Then came the Iranian revolution.</a> Some large proportion of $20s were said to be these indistinguishable "Superdollars", but supposedly changing things would have been too difficult until the redesign in 1998.
</li><li> There's another urban legend floating around about someone who successfully passed a $200 bill with George W. Bush's face on it. (Bush does not appear on any currency—living persons are forbidden from appearing on US currency—and the US Treasury Department does not print a $200 bill).
</li><li> There have been reports that stores have refused to accept $2 bills (a valid but not commonly used bill) simply because the clerk didn't know that they were real.
</li><li> Similarly to the $2 bill example, Scottish pound notes (which are technically not legal tender, even in Scotland<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3myl6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3myl6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3myl6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They're <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promissory_note">promissory notes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> issued by commercial banks; one of the reasons the UK didn't sign up to the Euro was that Scotland would lose the right to print them.</span>, but have a 1 to 1 exchange rate with English pounds) are allegedly sometimes rejected because they're mistaken for forgeries (or conversely - since Scotland still has paper £1 notes - they hand one over and get change for a fiver), although it's just as often because a lack of familiarity makes it harder to spot forgeries (the further south you go, the less likely Scottish currency is to be accepted). The latter is also true of £50 notes of either denomination (which normally only crop up in birthday cards or suspiciously large cash payouts).
</li><li> In a case that combined this with criminal carelessness (carelessness by criminals as well as carelessness that is criminal), Italian police seized 125 billion in counterfeit $500 million and $1 billion U.S. bearer bonds. No U.S. bearer bonds have been issued over $10,000.
</li><li> The adage "Don't take any wooden nickels!" dates from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">The Great Depression</a>, when counterfeiters would cut out little nickel-sized discs of wood and paint them so that they resembled a nickel if you didn't look too closely. One way to tell the difference was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastyGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastyGold">bite on the coin</a>; the 75% copper 25% nickel alloy of an actual five-cent piece is pretty hard against the teeth, but wood has some give to it and will allow you to leave tooth marks in it.
<ul><li> Or the alternative explanation: Shops would occasionally distribute promotional wooden tokens worth "five cents in trade at X's store". The catch being that if the shop went out of business (a common occurance during the Depression), the tokens would become worthless.
</li></ul></li><li> There were multiple cases in the 19th Century of people gilding nickels, tricking people into believing that they were five dollar coins. The person to try this actually got away with it, because 1: There was no law against gilding currency at the time (This was quickly corrected), and 2: He only bought 5 cent items with his gilded nickels, thus if the store clerk gave him $4.95 change, it was arguably an error on the part of the clerk.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_rupee_note">Zero Rupee Note<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a rare case of fake money being worth face value: Zip. It's used to "bribe" government officials in order to shame them for their greed and corruption. It's also printed in such a way to make it clear it's not <em>really</em> money (the reverse has information on the organization that produces them and looks nothing like currency).
</li><li> Joshua Norton, after he went insane from losing all his money in a scheme to corner the rice market, reinvented himself as "Norton the First, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico". He produced his own currency, for just enough to eat and live, and the people of San Francisco were kind enough to appreciate his weirdness and take the money.
</li><li> As an aside: US currency is among the most difficult to counterfeit in the world. The exact security methods are both well-known and secret: there's a watermark in every bill<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2in6p');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2in6p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2in6p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hold it up to the light and look for the image of the President</span>; there are "miscolored" threads in each bill<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30x3f');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note30x3f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30x3f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the exact number of threads in each denomination is not disclosed</span>; a plastic strip is embedded in the "paper"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4vqlg');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4vqlg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4vqlg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Again, hold it up to the light. It should say "US $100" or whatever the amount of the bill is</span>; the "paper" is made from a proprietary mix of linen and cotton<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5je62');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5je62" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5je62');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">With a unique "feel" or texture. The paper a dollar is printed on does not feel like any other kind of currency paper, and even more than the security measures, supposedly the texture of the paper is almost impossible to duplicate</span>. And that's just in the paper itself: the ink is a whole other story. The official estimate of counterfeit bills to actual bills is 1 in every 10,000. Counterfeits <em>do</em> exist, however. The US Treasury calls them "Superbills", as they are almost completely indistinguishable from real bills. Most counterfeit cash comes out of North Korea, which managed to get a set of legitimate US current printing plates several decades ago.
<ul><li> Which compares well with current Australian currency, which is printed on clear plastic and deliberately leaves a small area clear but impressed with the denomination so that copying onto paper will be easily detected<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4vy61');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4vy61" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4vy61');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Canada ended up copying Australian currency (or the other way around) so that the "paper" currency of both countries have the same "unique" look</span>. And the serial numbers are overprinted with a dye which is only visible under UV light, and the denomination is repeat printed over a background area in UV dye. And the ink is printed thickly enough to make the currency uniquely tactile. And the denomination of the bill is printed in practically microscopic characters as part of the background. And that's only the security devices they've told the general public about. The general idea is to make printing perfect copies too expensive on a small scale.
</li></ul></li><li> The USD $2 bill is in a league of its own. Perfectly legal, still printed, legal tender. However, the rarity of its usage garners attention. Odds are just shy of even that trying to use them to pay for something will get the holder questioned, if not denied service. Vending machines aren't even programmed to take them. The upshot being great for collectors as the bills often show very little wear for their age.
<ul><li> One urban legend tells of a person trying to pay for goods at a shopping mall using several $2 bills only to have security called on them and being accused of outright counterfeiting. The security guard, being a gentleman slightly older than the shopkeepers, is dumbfounded at the stupidity of the situation.
</li><li> Another joke, told by a comedian, suggests trying to pay for an Extra Value Meal with a fist full of $2 bills if one would like to see a whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> franchise grind to a halt and possibly have the police involved.
</li><li> While most US paper currency was significantly redesigned to further impede counterfeiting in the 1990s and 2000s (sometimes more than once, with the 2nd major redesigns for the $50 and $100 making them multicolored rather than just green), the $1 and $2 bills were not. The $1 has been effectively unchanged since 1935, and the $2 since 1976. This is because their value is considered too low to be worth counterfeiting and thus it's not worth the expense of redesigning them.
</li></ul></li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesleySnipes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesleySnipes">Wesley Snipes</a> got in trouble for tax evasion, he tried to get out of it by giving fake money. This of course didn't work, and he was arrested.
</li><li> Slugs are used to make illegal purchases from coin-op machines such as video game arcades and transit fareboxes, can come in many forms such as coins of other countries and metal washers, and are designed to fool a coin-op into thinking it's a real coin. It leads to lost revenue for the vendor, and even honest customers are cheated when the change returned is a slug. Though a crime, prosecution is rare given the theft's low value, and while older coin-ops are still prone to this fraud, newer machines have measures that can identify which coin being inserted is the real deal. Casinos are also more vigilant at enforcement as they use surveillance to monitor anyone who tries to bilk them, especially at the "one-armed bandits."
</li><li> In a strange example, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/atm-gives-customers-canadian-tire-money-1.474750">an ATM in Canada once dispensed Canadian Tire money<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> along with <em>actual</em> Canadian currency.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5v34j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5v34j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5v34j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For the uninitiated, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Tire_money">Canadian Tire money<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a form of scrip printed by the eponymous Canadian retailer. They started out as just coupons for their gas bars, but proved so popular they expanded to the whole chain. It isn't actual legal tender, but are essentially coupons you get when you purchase something; bills are printed in various cent and dollar denominations. They aren't worth much, but if you've got a lot you can exchange it for big stuff— people have bought snowblowers and full car repairs with their saved-up bills. Other, non-CT retailers and businesses have taken the money too.</span>
