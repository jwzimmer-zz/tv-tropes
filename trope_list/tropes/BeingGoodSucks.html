</p><ul><li> Sacrificing your own happiness: It can be any type of happiness, be it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">denying romance to protect</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, or where their quest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster">To Be a Master</a> is leveraged against a friend's life when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendOrIdolDecision">Friend or Idol Decision</a> comes along.
</li><li> Giving up your ambitions: Usually these are selfish or dark ambitions, and denying them <em>helps</em> the character in the long run. When a character wants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> for the murder of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTarget">loved one</a> in a world where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim">If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him</a>, their giving up murder (though not necessarily forgiving the villain) will cost them dearly but ultimately be the right thing. However, this can extend to less dark goals, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>. If the story deems the character's dream as "selfish" or bad, they have no choice but to give up.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> Good behavior. Obvious as it is, being good requires <em>acting</em> good. This means sharing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness">forgiving others</a>, not killing people and generally acting contrary to one's impulses to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> to those disliked. No matter how much they may wish or be tempted to do otherwise.
</li><li> Humility and honesty. Honesty is a big source of Suck when being good. It means that any wrongdoing on your part (or your friends') must be revealed. Worse, it means denying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a> and obeying the law. The character may find that to do what is right means going against stupid laws, becoming a wanted man, separated from loved ones, with their "reputation" ruined.
</li><li> Guilt over bad deeds - and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanSyndrome">not doing enough good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrictedRescueOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrictedRescueOperation">limits on what you can do</a>.
</li><li> Doing the right thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">doesn't always mean it's the nice thing.</a> Often in dilemmas where a normally nice character has to choose to either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeLawfulOrGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeLawfulOrGood">uphold a moral standard or being kind to others</a>. Whether it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelToBeKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelToBeKind">doing nasty deeds to save someone's life</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">telling an uncomfortable truth</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleTouchVsFirmHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleTouchVsFirmHand">guiding someone harshly in order for them to learn</a>, the character will have to go against their kind nature and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">do what they have to do</a> for the sake of doing what's right. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasTooHardOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasTooHardOnHim">The character will not enjoy this at all</a>. This may cause other characters to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">hate and resent the hero for making tough decisions that he is morally obligated to do.</a>
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Redemption</a>: A character realizing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks">Being Evil Sucks</a> will turn to the side of good, only to find out that it comes at a price since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsAffliction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsAffliction">Redemption Equals Affliction</a>. This means the character has to put aside their ego and acknowledge that they are in the wrong, accept their karmic punishment, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends">work hard to regain the trust and respect from others</a>, even if people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButRejected" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButRejected">aren't willing to forgive</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten">at least forget</a> what they've done.
</li><li> Giving up on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">so that they can be truly happy with someone else</a>, or somewhere else, or doing something else. You may end up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">someone else</a>...or you may end up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">Celibate Hero</a> or dead.
</li><li> Giving up some comfort because someone else has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterNeedThanMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterNeedThanMine">Greater Need Than Mine</a>.
</li><li> Saving people, even if they don't deserve it. Whether the person in need of saving is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">a group of characters who hate and mistreat the hero</a>, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveTheVillain">the villain who has committed many atrocities</a>, the hero must suck it up and lend a hand to his enemies and rivals, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefuseToRescueTheDisliked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefuseToRescueTheDisliked">refusing to save them and let them suffer their fate</a> is a huge no no. It doesn't matter if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">continue to show him zero respect after being saved</a>, and it doesn't matter if villains continue to bring evil and suffering upon the world, the hero must keep on saving them whether they like it or not.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Dying for a loved one, or a cause</a>.
</li><li> Achieving a goal by doing things the honorable way. By honorable, we mean that the character must do things the hard way because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsEasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsEasy">doing things the easy way often involve doing wrong to others.</a> The hero must work at the crack of dawn, avoid taking shortcuts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">avoid the temptation of doing things that would jeopardize their morals and alienate others around them</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">declining any offer of success given to them all in the name of hard work.</a>
</li><li> Accepting hardships. The character must accept and endure any hardships, suffering, and adversity with no complaints because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">Misery Builds Character</a>. If the character had it easy in life, they would never learn to grow as a character and, at worst, they will most likely be corrupt since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivilegeMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivilegeMakesYouEvil">Privilege Makes You Evil</a>. And when things get rough, giving up is out of the question for the hero and they have no choice but to tough it out or else they will be branded as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> for giving up (or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">giving up on life</a> if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideIsShameful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideIsShameful">Suicide Is Shameful</a> is a strong belief held by society).
</li><li> Doing good for the sake of doing good. This means the hero must not do good for self-serving reasons like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantsAPrizeForBasicDecency">wanting a reward</a>, avoiding a punishment, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">seeking a payment</a>, boosting their reputation, or even for an enjoyment of an adventure. They must only do good because it's the right thing to do, even if they won't get the reward or recognition they desire.
</li></ul><p>At times, it can lock characters into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>, where success requires an evil action, making winning and staying good impossible.
</p><p>On the other side of the fence, this crops up when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFeelsGood">Evil Feels Good</a>. Often applies to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> character, or a hero who laments that they have to save somebody they hate from a burning building, or they don't get to kill their most hated enemy, because that's the "heroic" decision.
</p><p>In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>, this trope applies to a great degree but being <em>anything</em> in such a world generally sucks.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppositeTropes">Contrast</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood">Good Feels Good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks">Being Evil Sucks</a>.
Also, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, or, if you're lucky, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">Earn Your Happy Ending</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">No Good Deed Goes Unpunished</a>, where the good action (rather than the process of being good) is what gets the characters in trouble. May result in someone expressing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero">Sympathy for the Hero</a>. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudiniWarranty">Karma Houdini Warranty</a>, where trying to turn over a new leaf can bring down heaven's wrath. This is one way people become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">Iron Woobie</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor">Knight in Sour Armor</a>, depending on whether the suffering is taken with quiet dignity or grumpy complaining. This belief is the original mentality of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralPragmatist">Moral Pragmatist</a> before a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> or someone tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">Cut Lex Luthor a Check</a>, but they may wind up here again if they're proven right. A common justification for believing this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness">Virtue Is Weakness</a>.
</p><p>There are many instances in real life in which being 'good' doesn't suck that much. Scientifically, deeds perceived as good - whether or not they are good - entail social recognition and approval, and bad deeds entail reprisal. Most villains or villainous groups might also view their actions as 'good' in some sense, however, and therefore it might be unclear that this counts as 'good' in the same sense as a story with an author-determined moral compass. Justice is one of the fundamental evolutionary imperatives that allows human society to function coherently; we may not all be saints, but we're not all lawless murderers. Unless you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a> It's usually more profitable to abide by society's rules, and even in that case you could be best off being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>. However, the more you could influence perception in such a context, the less it would matter here whether or not you were evil. Of course, multiple societies might have different and often conflicting moral codes, even within their own confines; further, if people like Karl Marx (himself a 'villain' to some, but not all) are to be believed, the conflict within societies can sometimes be such as to give rise to fundamentally opposed forces and force recourse to struggle. Further, moral codes change over time, and this occasionally leads to conflicts between earlier morality and new trends. As a result, a simplistic application of the story-telling categories of 'villains' and 'heroes' from fiction to real life might be worth avoiding, when it comes to this trope.

After witnessing his father and all of his friends die at the hands of the androids, Gohan went into hiding in order to train himself to become strong enough to challenge this new threat. He spent his entire adult life challenging the androids to no avail, watching as countless innocents died at the hands of the monstrous duo. His reward for all of his self-sacrifice was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">lose his left arm</a>, and in the next and final fight between him and his two nemeses, Gohan was completely outmatched, killed, and left face down in the ruins of yet another city he failed to protect.

</li><li> As a teenager, Trunks wants to help Gohan defeat the androids, underestimating their strength.

This breaks him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis">No-Nonsense Nemesis</a> to his enemies. After spending time in the past fighting stronger versions of Androids 17, 18, and then later Perfect Cell, things finally <em>seem</em> to go his way after he destroys all the androids and later prevents Majin Buu's revival. Then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goku Black</span> attacks his world and murders <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his mother</span> and several innocent people.

When he returns to the future for the second time to fight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goku Black and Future Zamasu</span> with the help of Goku and Vegeta, he is told by them that it's his fault that the Earth is destroyed because of his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> time-traveling</span>. This causes him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">snap</a> and gain a new Super Saiyan form that <em>still</em> isn't strong enough to defeat them. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goku Black and Future Zamasu fused to create Merged Zamasu, he manages to cut him down using the energy of everyone still alive on the planet, only for Merged Zamasu to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> of multiversal proportions who kills the rest of humanity</span>.

His life is <em>not</em> a happy one.
</li><li> While Goku is usually the pagan for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood">Good Feels Good</a>, he does have a moment like this moment after Frieza is defeated in the Namek Saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. He really, <em>really</em>, wants to leave Frieza to die after he's cut to pieces on his own energy disc, but Goku's morality <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">won't allow him to ignore a call for help</a>, even from an evil monster like Frieza. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConscienceMakesYouGoBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConscienceMakesYouGoBack">He eventually gives in to his conscience</a> and gives Frieza enough energy to escape the exploding planet.

<ul><li> He has another moment near the end of the Buu Saga. After Kid Buu unleashed an energy ball powerful enough to destroy the Earth several times over, Goku and Vegeta rushes to Gohan, Goten, Trunks, and Piccolo, who are still unconscious after being absorbed by Buu, to teleport them off the planet. On his way, Goku sees Mr. Satan and Dende. On instinct, he grabs them and wasted too much time to save his sons and have to be saved by the Supreme Kai. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">Vegeta chews him out for saving them instead of their children</a>, and Goku has nothing to say for himself.
</li></ul></li><li> The reason Yamcha fought the Saibamen was to protect Krillin who wanted to go next. As he pointed out, Krillin was revived already with the Dragon Balls so him dying would have been permanent, while he could be revived if the worst happens. For his good deed, Yamcha gets suicide bomb by the Saibaman, making him the first casualty of the Saiyan Invasion and he never even gets the chance to fight Nappa. And worst of all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">the fandom won't ever let him live it down</a>.
</li><li> Vegeta was a firm believer in this prior to the end of the Buu Saga. Having settled down on Earth and formed a family, he saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness">his newfound virtues as a weakness</a>, and deliberately allows Babidi to brainwash him so he could be free of it and return to the super-powerful evil prince he was before.

This sets him up for execution until Cirucci bargains with Aizen to grant amnesty to her conspirators. By the end of the chapter, Dordonni - his rival in the Exequias contest and fellow Privaron Espada - gains a new title, Cirucci becomes the Quinta, and his subordinate becomes the new Exequias.

I don't want that choice for my son, or his son, or any that come after. This is it. Our debt to Gotham, our debt to Thomas and Martha Wayne, our debt to my family...they're all...they're all paid. The Batman is just blood and death and pain. We don't fly among the eagles, soaring to the sun. We're down in the gutters, picking through the corpses for clues. We can't bounce blasters off our chests. All we've got is two fists and fear on our side. It's not a legacy, boys. It's a curse. The curse ends with me.

<div class="indent"><strong>Spider-Man:</strong> Cap became an Avenger in short order. If there's anybody that symbolized the good in America more than him, I've never met him. But there was something else about him. Two things, actually. <br/>First, he'd failed to save his partner, Bucky, from getting killed. That happened in the same incident that got Cap frozen. Eventually, Cap tracked down the Nazi responsible for it, and made him pay for it. But he never really got over it. There was some part of Cap that never stopped living in World War II, before Bucky's death, and that same part wouldn't let him get close enough to somebody who might get killed the same way. <br/>Second, he really had a burden on his shoulders with the American symbol thing. Literally, Cap was unable to accept himself messing up. Because if Captain America was seen screwing up, doing anything badly, blowing a mission, it would almost be seen as America screwing up...that's not the way I thought, but it was the way Cap saw it. So he held himself to impossible standards. And he almost always met them. Almost. He was the best man to have on your side at any time. But I never envied him. Not a single day.

So far, "being sufficiently cunning to get away with being either Good or Evil" seems to be the hardest part of all.

The latter then threatens Holt's husband, Kevin, and ends up kidnapping Jake and Holt for his revenge on the theft being averted by the police, alhtough they were saved in the end. In addition to that, because of his progressive policies on how to run the NYPD, all of his opponents but one had to be removed (either because of bad health or that they gave up) for him to have a chance for the commissioner post, which he didn't even get, in favour to the much more conservative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">John</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">Kelly</a>.</span>

<ul><li> Applies this to renegade Abyssals, who can't settle down or huge bursts of necrotic Essence will kill everyone in the area; they can't directly oppose their former patrons or they'll take enough lethal damage to cripple them or knock them unconscious; and people tend to be even more afraid of them than the normal Solars, because of the whole "sometimes looking like a skeleton and bleeding from the forehead for a caste mark" thing.
<ul><li> Fortunately, new rules have been provided which allows an Abyssal's Lunar Exalted Mate to ease their burden through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">friendship</a>, if that's how they roll). An Abyssal can freely commit "sins of Life" with their Lunar Mate (protecting their lives or having sex with them, for example), and the Neverborn are incapable of punishing them for it. If the Abyssal actually cares for their Lunar, they can even freely commit "sins against Death" for them with impunity — which includes directly opposing their former patrons. This same update also included guidelines for how Abyssal Exalted can redeem themselves into free, untainted Solar Exalted, a process which Lunar Mates make much easier.
</li></ul></li><li> Same thing applies to the Green Sun Princes. If they decide to go against the will of their Yozi patrons (which is usually "Make Creation such a shithole that it can technically count as Hell, which means we can get out of our prison"), they begin to accrue Torment that leaks out and affects others. In fact, the only way to bleed off Torment is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">perform cliched acts of utter bastardry</a>, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">it says nothing about who you have to perform them on...</a>
<ul><li> Unlike Abyssals, Green Sun Princes <em>cannot</em> be redeemed into normal Solars during life but the same difference means that if their essence was somehow delivered to Autochthon, the Unconquered Sun, or a similar entity after death, it could be purified in this manner.
</li></ul></li><li> This is also a game mechanic for Infernal and Abyssal Charms. The former were specifically designed to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">Bad Powers, Bad People</a> by not being particularly malevolent in practice. You can use Infernal Charms to feed the hungry, force corrupt gods to do their damn jobs, protect your loved ones, bestow regeneration on loyal agents and turn into a benevolent counterpart to a hostile Exalt, while most Abyssal Charms boil down to "hurt people" and "be like the dead". GSP's who are serious about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaustianRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaustianRebellion">breaking out</a> can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">kick the snot out of this model</a> around Essence 6.

</li><li> Companions Arcade Gannon and Veronica Santangelo, both idealists in their own way will not end up with satisfying endings. Arcade will see that an Independent New Vegas isn't as perfect as he wants it to be but does what he can to help others while other paths have him be disillusioned or wind up dead, either due to his Enclave heritage or due to being enslaved by the Legion. Veronica will either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">stay with</a> the Brotherhood of Steel despite knowing that their current path will lead them to ruin or be forever traumatized by their zealotry after leaving to join the Followers. J.E. Sawyers states that one of the themes of the game is that in a world as harsh as the Fallout setting, the idealist is the one to be hurt the most.
</li><li> This applies to the Honest Hearts DLC with New Canaanite Missionary Daniel. If he succeeds in evacuating the Sorrows as he wanted, he'll forever question himself on whether or not he did the right thing. If they instead choose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingThePeacefulVillagers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingThePeacefulVillagers">stay and fight</a> the White Legs, he'll be forever haunted by their loss of innocence.

Occasionally, you'll come across people who ask you to bend the rules, often with sob stories like the wife who lacks proper paperwork and wants to be with her husband. You can oblige them, but you will receive citations for doing so, potentially costing you money needed to support your family.

No matter how strict of a Paragon you are, you still have to choose between letting the Council die, or allowing the human Alliance fleet to suffer heavy casualties. There is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdOption">Third Option</a>, and no "reward choice" for being a good guy.

</li><li> Being the team's healer in a multiplayer or a MMORPG can often invoke this. You will have a lot of responsibilty in keeping your teammates in living condition and you'll often get the blame if something goes wrong, even if it isn't your fault. This is know as the Blame the Healer mentality. Besides that, you will often become the Nr. 1 on many enemy players hit list.

Keeping your squad pure from corruption means that you need to refrain from equipping the best weapons in the game as those tend to be tainted with the power of Chaos. The missions will also have conditions that needs to be done if you want the squad to avoid or lose Chaos corruption. Most of the time, those conditions will wind up making the missions harder than it needs to be.

</li><li> Some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WWEVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WWEVideoGames">WWE Video Games</a></em> fall into the trap of rewarding bad guy wrestlers for heel tactics (such as eye rakes or cheap pins) whilst rewarding good guy wrestlers for face tactics (such as breaking cleanly and releasing submission holds when ordered to do so). The trouble is that heel tactics are effective on their own whilst face tactics usually involve passing up a chance to inflict more punishment. Even if the rewards for following each play style are equal the heel characters will still have an advantage in terms of damage dealt.

Most of the time he has to seek a resolution himself and sometimes has to resort to passive-aggression or violence in order to achieve the right results.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> The crux of Steven's character throughout the show. While he starts off as a comical, somewhat obnoxious goof that's focused on having fun with the Gems and easily gets distracted, he gradually gains an understanding of how serious his missions actually are - first as he struggles to replicate even the most basic powers the other Gems can do, then as he attempts to harness his unique abilities shared by his mother. He displays doubts that he won't be able to live up to the reputation of his mother, especially as she was the leader of the Crystal Gems during the war. Throughout Season 1, he gains maturity as he tries to find a balance between his responsibility and finding time for fun, but after the season finale he starts to come to terms that the enemy might not be so easy to deal with after he's captured by Jasper and is forced to watch as his friend Lapis Lazuli sacrifices herself to keep Jasper from hurting him. Season 2 shows that he's sadly become all too aware of the Gems' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorship">Hero Worship</a> of Rose, and that he starts to believe he really might be his mother and they might blame him for not being around. He learns of the horrific Gem experiments conducted by Homeworld and the frightening amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a> and near the end of the season starts to lose faith in Peridot, who he thought he could help to overcome her prejudices and backwards mindset. Thankfully he's proven right, but it's still a struggle to consider that there's some people he might be unable to save. Season 3 has him being forced to confront the horror of the Cluster as their thousands of fragmented minds psychically scream for help, learning to help Lapis with her deep-seeded self-hatred and mental scars, and later come into conflict with an old Crystal Gem who tries to kill him over the ethics of war because of one of his mother's dark secrets. If that weren't enough, Jasper and a Homeworld Ruby can't be reasoned with and he has no way to save them, in the latter case having to strand her in space to survive, and they blame him for the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">apparent</span> death of Pink Diamond, who once again was because of Rose. If all that weren't enough, Season 4 shows that he suffers from mental trauma as he has flashbacks that he was unable to save Bismuth, Jasper, and Ruby, and feels guilt that a pacifist like him has no choice but to do darker things when an enemy refuses help. By now, he's had to go through immensely stressful situations, and, while not lacking his enthusiasm or desire to do good, it's cost him his innocence and is a far cry from the child he once was at the beginning of the series.
</li><li> Played with in Keystone Motel. When Garnet defuses due to Ruby and Sapphire disagreeing on how to deal with Pearl tricking them into fusing, Sapphire says they need to forgive Pearl for the good of the group while Ruby is frustrated that they always have to be 'the bigger Gem'.

She admits it's hard for her not to have some lingering feelings for the place she came from, but thankfully she got over it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>, Earl Cooper was a car engineer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Global Motors</a>. He reported a design flaw in one of their cars to the board of directors. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">However, they refused to remove the product from the market on their lawyers' advice.</a> Earl was determined to talk to the authorities as lives were at stake. The executives sent a bunch of thugs to silence him, but thankfully Batman saved him. Earl's testimony then rocked Global Motors in a massive scandal. Years later, Earl found himself out of job because he got a reputation as a whistleblower.
</li><li> Implied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> episode "Rest and Ricklaxation". When Rick and Morty go to an alien spa to have the toxic traits of their personalities removed from them, Morty loses his empathy and humility, pretty much becoming a lowkey sociopath in the process. Its eventually revealed that the spa removes what the individual <em>believes</em> are their toxic traits, even of those traits may not be truly negative. Although considering the show weighs <em>far</em> to the right on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a> and <em>loves</em> showing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">No Good Deed Goes Unpunished</a>, it's understandable why Morty would hate the more positive traits about himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em>: After failing to achieve the 'Ring of Invincibility' in "The Battle Royale" (which was actually a candy ring pop anyway), The Black Cube of Darkness gives up on being a villain, as seen in "The Black Cube". Sadly, trying to walk the path of the hero has left him with a dead end job, a shitty apartment, no companionship whatsoever, and people either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">flee at the sight of him</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">harass him, despite having the power to steal souls.</a> Luckily, things start to look up for him by the episode's end.
</li><li> This is the reason why Optimus Prime and Bumblebee ended up where they were at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. For Optimus, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during his court martial, he took the blame for Sentinel's idea for them and the (supposedly) late Elita-One to go treasure-hunting on an offlimit world, where Elita was supposedly killed, while Sentinel would claim that <em>he</em> insisted that this was a bad idea, when in truth, it was the other way around. As punishment, Optimus was washed out of the Autobot Academy and sent off to do space bridge maintenance with a team of other equally lowly Autobots (which was a <em>favor</em> by Ultra Magnus, who was otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedInYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedInYou">disappointed in him</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">came to believe that he wasn't destined to be a hero after all</a>), while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Sentinel managed to enlist in the Elite Guard as Ultra Magnus's second-in-command</a></span>. Bumblebee, on the other hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">intended to expose Wasp as a spy to win Sentinel's approval and therefore fasttrack to the Elite Guard. Though he was successful, he decided to let that opportunity go when Sentinel was about to unfairly wash out Bulkhead, since he felt awful for being a jerk towards him in spite of him being the only 'bot that treated him kindly</span>. Though as the show goes on, it proves that being good ultimately <em>is</em> good.

Doing good, even though it's hard at times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor">adds to your virtue</a>.

He saved all of them from suffering and death. Unfortunately this bankrupted him, and he lived on charity from the people he saved.
</li><li> Applies to witnesses to crimes who want to testify, but fear retribution by the criminals or their associates. You could go into witness protection, only to lose everything you have to live a completely different life.

</li><li> Anytime anyone sacrifices their own life to save another. Sure, dying so that others may live is perhaps one of the most selfless things that anyone can do, but you still have to <em>die</em>.
</li><li> It's a well-known (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">sad</a>) fact that kids who are bullied at school often get in trouble for retaliating in self-defense. Now, go ask somebody who has tried to interfere and protect a victim from being bullied. Chances are they got in trouble along with the victim. It's also not unheard of for kids who try to defend a victim from their bullies, only to become the next target.
</li><li> Many victims dealing with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">spousal</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">parental</a> abuse who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">retaliate against said abuser</a> (especially physically in self-defense) will often find themselves facing the charges, while the abuser ends up the one interpreted as the victim by the authorities.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://now.msn.com/living/0416-ohio-hs-grad-ban.aspx">This high school student<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was unable to graduate because he missed 16 days of school. Those days were spent caring for his cancer-stricken mother. Fortunately, the decision was reversed.
</li><li> Being a whistleblower at your job. You will be thanked and given a small reward, but good luck ever finding another job. A person can also face criminal charges depending on which company or organization they blew the whistle on, especially government agencies when the whistleblowing involves leaking classified information.
</li><li> One of the few reasons why sexual harassment at the workplace usually goes unchallenged. Sometimes, if the person who is doing the harassing is a vital employee to the company whereas the victim is just some new guy/girl or desperate for their job, it's not too unheard of for the company to just fire the person complaining about the harassment.
</li><li> If you're an altruistic person you'd better avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidGood">Stupid Good</a> behaviour, otherwise, you might get exploited for all you're worth by freeloaders and deadbeats.
</li><li> There's an alleged story of a British soldier named Henry Tandey, who served in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">first world war</a> where he chose not to shoot a retreating, wounded German soldier. While this was an honourable and noble act, which was appreciated by the wounded soldier, the soldier in question was none other than a 29-year-old <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong>, the man who started the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">second world war</a>. The act was branded by history, and Henry was given the condemning title of "The Man Who Spared Hitler".
<ul><li> The facts behind the story are disputable and the strongest amount of evidence came from Hitler, Neville Chamberlain and Henry himself. One bit of evidence has Hitler seeing a painting of Henry and remarking to Chamberlain, "That man came so near to killing me that I thought I should never see Germany again; Providence saved me from such devilishly accurate fire as those English boys were aiming at us."
</li></ul></li><li> Any job that involves helping the public can feel like this (police, doctors, teachers, or even customer service). Sure, you'll get the occasional thank you or even a gift, but you'll likely get twice as many people not even thanking you or even outright berating you for trying to help them. In the end, those people still have to be helped when needed.
</li><li> Caring a lot about people can be a very painful thing. In fact, the word "compassion" literally means "to suffer with."
