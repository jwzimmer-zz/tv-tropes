</p><p>It may factor in on the scale of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, that you must die alone. Sending someone away, so that you die alone, is often a generous gesture, and those who leave may be deeply criticized.

Jyoka, being afraid of dying alone, requests that Taikoubou accompany her, to which he agrees. After she dies, he is left to crumble and die alone, away from all his companions and friends.

He dies a slow death alone, crawling through the rain, attempting to reunite with Pacifica (with their happy memories together flashing through his mind).
<ul><li> Here's one right up there: the death of the Queen, Pacifica's <em>mother</em>. She gets thrown in the dungeon cell adjacent an amnesia-ridden Pacifica. Neither recognizes each other.

His teenage son died in a car accident, he and his wife have divorced, and he just found out he has throat cancer, but the fact that he's going to die isn't what scares him - it's the idea of dying alone in a hospital bed with no-one there.

He passes away on Tuesday, but no one noticed until Saturday evening when a janitor finds him sitting in the dark. It took over four days for any of 25 other employees in the room to realize that they were working with a corpse. Since he was a quiet person and died in his typical sitting position, everyone just assumed he was really absorbed in his work. His personality doesn't change when he comes back as a ghost.

</li><li> In Charles Logan's 1975 science-fiction novel <em>Shipwreck</em>, there is only one character, Isidore Tansis: well, only one human character at least: there is a nearly-intelligent computer without consciousness, and also alien creatures of unknown intelligence. Tansis is the sole survivor of a spaceship nuclear power disaster (a few fellow survivors are mentioned briefly as having died of radiation sickness before the novel starts). He manages to escape in a scout craft and land on a nearby planet, where he has to figure out his own survival for years to come, as there is no hope of anyone coming to rescue him (no other ships are within many light-years, and the story is set in a universe with no faster-than-light travel). This is very difficult, as the planet is not quite hostile to human life, but rather inhospitable, and the struggle to survive gets harder and harder over some years, and his health eventually starts to fail. It is hardly a spoiler that, at the end, Tansis dies, since it is the inevitable outcome of the situation right from page 1; but what is not quite so clear is whether he is, in fact, dying alone when in the company of several seal-like sea creatures with whom he cannot communicate, because they speak only by dilating their eye pupils in complex patterns, but with whom he somehow feels a mystical union.

<ul><li> Pycelle in season 6. Qyburn (the one who has him killed) says he wished this could have happened in better circumstances. This happens to Lancel Lannister and Tommen Baratheon in the same episode. Lancel, paralyzed by a stab wound and alone in the tunnels beneath King's Landing, futilely tries to stop the wildfire from going off and is its first victim. Tommen, staring at the still burning ruins of the Great Sept, is alone when he takes off his crown and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">calmly steps through the open window</a>.

Earl decides to give him a decent funeral... which proves to be a challenge, since Earl did not know him, and this man apparently did not have any family or friends.

Notably, it is an underlying theme in the finale, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAI">The Machine</a> discusses how she was forced to watch millions of people die in order to fully understand human behavior. She points out that most of them die alone. Though she also points out something else: "Everyone dies alone. But if you meant something to someone, if you helped someone, or loved someone, if even a single person remembers you, then maybe you never really die. And maybe, this isn't the end at all." (The Machine, to herself; the last words of the series.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em>, Robin himself dies alone after bidding goodbye to his friends and wandering into Sherwood Forest by himself. He is apparently met by the spirit of Marian as he dies, but this could be a hallucination brought on by the poison in his system. Somewhat of a subversion considering Robin <em>chooses</em> to die alone, specifically telling the others "I have to do this alone."

Although she was by his side for most of it, she left with the rest of her resistance cell to kill those responsible. Her father died alone, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">calling out her name</a>, she only missed it by a matter of hours. It haunted her for the rest of her life. The episode that reveals this, <em>Ties Of Blood and Water</em>, also has a Cardassian who became a surrogate father-figure to her dying. After learning of something he did during the Occupation she storms off, only to be convinced to return as "he doesn't deserve to die alone." She returns and stays with him until he dies, and then buries him next to her father.

When this is discovered, she is sent to an abandoned nuclear disposal facility to explode there without causing damage to Stargate Command. Maj. Samantha Carter defies orders to leave her there and escape, instead choosing to stay with her and die with her. The bomb fails to detonate.

She turns back into a mannequin, freeing the burglar that she turned into a mannequin at the beginning of the episode. At this point the blind man she recently started a relationship with enters the room searching for her. The burglar shoots him in a panic before fleeing. The blind man slumps to the ground in pain, begging May to hold his hand because he doesn't want to die alone. He dies professing his love for May while all she can do is stare silently and motionlessly at the scene.

It is implied that Mike prefered dying alone.

<ul><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, this is what happened to Jesus at his death. Not only is he betrayed by one of his disciples, but the others — who truly respect him — are unable to be with him as he enters his final hours. As he is praying in preparation for his eventual fate, the three disciples who he takes to wait with him fall asleep. Peter, one of his closest followers, denies he even knew Jesus in order to save his own skin. The whole atmosphere of alienation is a contrast to the traditional pictures of a triumphant Messiah entering into glory. The worst of it? This abandonment by those nearest to him was a <em>necessary</em> part of his unglamorous death. No wonder even Jesus was apprehensive of what his end would entail.
<ul><li> Moses dies alone as well. "Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the Lord showed him the whole land...And Moses the servant of the Lord died there in Moab, as the Lord had said. He buried him[a] in Moab, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but to this day no one knows where his grave is." (Deut 34:1-6)

While they do go out in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">Dying Moment of Awesome</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, it's still gut-wrenching to see them watch the <em>Normandy</em> fly away as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">the nuke's timer reaches the single digits...</a>
</li><li> Shepard dies this way at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, where during the evacuation of the <em>Normandy</em> they go back to rescue Joker, which leads to them getting spaced shortly afterwards. Cerberus later recovers Shepard's body and spends the next two years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">bringing them back to life</a>.
</li><li> Potentially happens again at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The entire point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FragileDreamsFarewellRuinsOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FragileDreamsFarewellRuinsOfTheMoon">Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon</a></em> is for the main character, Seto, to avert this trope and find someone else just to talk to. He prevents several characters from falling to this fate like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">P.F, Crow</a> and Chiyo and then finds the mysterious girl, Ren, thus averting this trope... until older, and possibly dead Seto mentions that something happened after many summers together and she's not there anymore, leaving him to die alone.
</li><li> It is all but spelled out in the ending sequence of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> —as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTowerOfOminousness">Kefka's Tower</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadBearingBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadBearingBoss">collapses</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">Magic vanishing from the world</a>, Shadow silently breaks off from the party to hide in a secluded niche, and face Death both as penance as well as defiance. He even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShooTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShooTheDog">sends Interceptor away</a> to spare him this fate.
<ul><li> It's less obvious but implied that this is what happens to Shadow if you don't wait for him at the end of the floating continent panic sequence - and it's also implied that this happens to anyone you don't retrieve in the World of Ruin: all you get for their part of the ending is their portrait floating above their last known location. With a couple of exceptions: Terra, who shows up regardless; and Sabin, who's mentioned in the scene he would normally share with Edgar - although he would likely survive regardless.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, this is what Roxas implies will happen to him when he talks with Axel as he's leaving Organization XIII. When Axel tries to convince him not to leave, telling him the Organization will kill him, Roxas says indifferently that "no one would miss me". And in a way, he <em>did</em> sort of end up dying alone. Or, at least, having the majority of his personality go dormant inside of Sora, with no one being there with him at the time when he returned to Sora's body.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, that happens to Asch. Probably. The fandom is still mulling it over.
</li><li> Somewhat subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>, where Porky traps himself in the Absolutely Safe Chamber in a self-induced version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a>. However, Dr. Andronuts states that because he was at heart a lonely child who lived his life on the fact that everyone hates him, dying alone is perhaps the closest thing he can ever get to being happy at this point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em>:
<ul><li> It was thought that Maiev the Warden had died on Outland some point during or after <em>The Frozen Throne</em>. A text from god-knows-where says that she died "alone on the red sand, unmourned, unsung, with none to remember her fall, her soul empty of all but rage". It was later retconned when she was brought back for the Burning Crusade expansion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>.</em> And after defeating Illidan with the help of the players, she admits that she is empty now, and as she's never seen again, is possibly subject to this trope. Maiev reappears in the novel <em>Wolfheart</em>, which takes place back on Azeroth, and has become something of a police sergeant for Darnassus until it's revealed she had gone mad without Illidan to chase, and was murdering the Highborne herself. Jarod hesitated and she escaped.
</li><li> Lilian Voss specifically requests this after she's possessed by Darkmaster Gandling and the players are forced to kill her. But she survives, as she returns in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> should you build an Inn in your garrison - apparently, she's looking for a weapon that can kill Necromancers with great efficiency.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em>, Noble Six, ironically enough, dies alone in an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">Last Stand</a>, seemingly the only human (or even non-Covenant animal) still alive on his continent of the titular planet, Reach.

Throughout the game, Six watches every member of his team die (except Jun), one by one, and three of the occasions were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifices</a> either directly or indirectly done to save Six's life. Still, given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">he died amidst the fresh corpses of a bunch of Elites</a>, it's perhaps slightly less alone.

</li><li> The player character of nearly every game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series is heavily implied to die alone. The Vault Dweller of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> has it particularly bad, he is implied in the original game to wander the wastes alone forever. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> you find out he did have a family (including you) but his wife died before him and he felt he had the leave the village so others could take his place as an elder. He wandered off into the waste alone again, this time as a frail old man with his life behind him. Ironically, The Lone Wander in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> averts this and will either die with a close friend nearby (if Broken Steel isn't installed) or is shown to walk into the wastes with his loyal dog.

The latter informs him that the mastermind behind the death of his sister and nephew wasn't the Chinese mafia, as he believed, but the major Gabriel Kaburaya. Richard goes the American army's HQ to kill Gabriel and gets his chest full of lead in the ensuing duel. Butler then quietly shows up and kills Gabriel with the already dead Richard's gun, to make it seem it was his doing (he tried to use him as an assassin from the start). The whole scene has a tragic and crepuscular feel to it that makes Richard really pathetic, as he has literally nothing left and dies like a mere pawn. And in the same scene, Gabriel sort of counts too.

<ul><li> Joe Simpson says in his memoir <em>Touching the Void</em> that he thinks it was not so much the fear of dying but the fear of dying <em>alone</em> that kept him committed to the apparently hopeless task of crawling back to camp after he suffered a broken leg in the mountains and was left behind by a climbing partner who believed him already dead.

With hundreds, perhaps thousands, of (nautical) miles to the nearest human being. Most drowning victims, in general, die alone, mainly because if someone else was present, they wouldn't <em>be</em> a drowning victim. People who go out swimming alone in uncertain waters, people who go out fishing by themselves and fall overboard (often men, standing to relieve themselves and losing their balance), even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">children in backyard swimming pools</a>.
</li><li> The fate of space probes and rovers sent out into the abyss of space. The scientists and engineers who build them often spend years dreaming, planning, constructing, and testing them, then wait years as they hurtle through the void towards their destinations, then see them shine in glory as they add to the sum of human knowledge. But, inevitably, and often all-too-soon, wires corrode, performance declines, and batteries fade. Then the people who have spent years together with both their colleagues and their creations must say goodbye as a chapter of their life closes. And far away, so far away that even their death is known only to themselves for minutes or hours because light itself is too slow to bring the news to their creators, a small, hardworking machine made of materials that have known a single world for 4.5 billion years only to be sped away on plumes of smoke and thunder has died while crushed under acid-soaked oceans of air, or while the screech of thin, frosty winds swept about it, or burned up like a falling star in an alien depthless atmosphere, or in the dim starlight that breaks the eternal darkness to which it has been consigned... forever.

</li><li> Anyone who has worked in a hospital or hospice can testify to the fact that many people actually <em>want</em> to die alone. They may want to face the mystery of death on their own, or (more commonly) they might want to spare their families the anguish of witnessing the death. Some will ask the family to leave the room "for a minute" (if they're able to communicate at that point), while others will simply struggle to remain alive until the family leaves for the night. Unfortunately, this often causes unnecessary guilt among survivors who buy into this trope and who punish themselves for "selfishly" not having been there. In recent years, some hospitals have made efforts to avoid this for their more isolated patient populations by implementing programs where volunteers are brought in to befriend and comfort the terminally ill during their last weeks of life.
<ul><li> One of the major ideas behind a hospice/palliative care is to <em>avert</em> this. While one reason is to ensure that the dying is both mentally prepared and physically without pain, it usually also provides the service that the dying isn't alone in their last minutes. Depending on how fast they die, they will either be with a nurse or said nurse will have alarmed the family so they can be with their beloved one last time.
</li></ul></li><li> In a veterinarian's personal account, though pet owners are given the option to leave the room when their pet is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">euthanized</a>, he pleads for them not to. The pets always become scared and confused, desperately looking for their master right when they're about to die.
</li><li> Cats, if dying, have a tendency to find a secluded place in which to die. This can be inverted, as a cat with a loving family will continue living in pain because it can't die alone. Some dogs will do this too.

In a way, its parting monologue is touching. On the other hand, its cold mechanistic appearance and GLaDOS style voice make it disturbing. A question that comes up is whether a cold, unfeeling companion in death is better than no companion at all. Which, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">according to its creator</a>, is the <em>point</em> of the machine - to highlight that dichotomy and, hopefully, spur people to change.

</li><li> Isolation is a problem for patients of obstetric fistula. This is a condition caused (most often) by prolonged labor, in places where C-sections are unavailable. (It is most prevalent in developing countries, particularly ones where girls are married off and become pregnant at a young age and/or have many closely-spaced pregnancies, there's famine and/or drought, and obstetric and prenatal care are limited to nonexistent.) What happens is the baby's head presses on blood vessels in the mother's pelvic region, cutting off circulation and leading to the necrosis of surrounding tissue. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ytxf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ytxf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ytxf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It <em>does</em> have other causes, too, such as violent rape, botched pelvic surgery, pelvic fracture, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease. But prolonged labor <em>is</em> the most common cause of this problem. </span> The result of this is a hole (fistula) left between the urethra and vagina, or between the rectum and vagina, or both, which leads to the uncontrollable leakage of waste through the vagina. Because of the bad smell (and sometimes other complications, such as infections, paralysis from nerve damage, and lack of energy), and sometimes cultural views of this condition as being a divine punishment for some type of wrongdoing or the result of evil spirits, many such girls and women find themselves abandoned and forced to live alone, often dying from infections in the process. (It is estimated that 50-80% of OF patients are divorced by their husbands.) Some <em>are</em> lucky enough to receive treatment and help to rejoin society, but most are not.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisFarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisFarley">Chris Farley</a> died of an overdose following a weekend-long binge of sex and drugs in his apartment in Chicago. The last person to see him alive was a prostitute, and his final words were a desperate attempt to get her to stay: "Please don't leave me. Please don't leave me." Sadly, she did, and Farley died alone.
