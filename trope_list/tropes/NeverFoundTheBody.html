</li><li> There are a couple of these in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> multiverse.
<ul><li> This happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quattro Bajeena</span> in the final battle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a></em>, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his</span> trashed mobile suit is discovered afterwards with the cockpit hatch open.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Gundam SEED</a></em> when the cracked helmet of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mwu La Flaga</span> is seen floating in space after taking an anti-battleship cannon head-on. Then played straight in the compilation special as the helmet is edited out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to set up his return in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny">Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em></span>.

<ul><li> Not that it stopped almost anyone else who seemingly perished in the last couple episodes of the season from then being confirmed as alive.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> title <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MobileSuitGundam00GundamMeister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MobileSuitGundam00GundamMeister">Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Gundam Meister</a></em> showed the body. Though whether that can be considered canon is debatable.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The final fate of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amon and Robin</span> in the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin">Witch Hunter Robin</a></em>. In fact, it is heavily implied that none of their colleagues believe the official story.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>: the body missing is of a person who can regenerate any injury, and the leader of one of the two allied armies present knows enough to find the body first, or he plans to betray his allies, and grab power for himself, one or the other.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> in the case of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> 2nd Lt.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> played quite a bit with this.
<ul><li> You could say that if a character doesn't explode inside a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> or isn't shown lying on the ground in a pool of blood, they're probably coming back. Case in point, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nunnally and Sayoko were thought to have been killed on their shuttle in the FLEYA explosion that destroyed Tokyo</span>. Justified later on because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there were actually two different escape shuttles and Schneizel had arranged the whole affair beforehand</span>. A few episodes later, it was revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Guilford</span> joined the club.
</li><li> One argument about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lelouch</span> is that despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyDeadMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyDeadMontage">Really Dead Montage</a></span>, part of what makes the epilogue ambiguous and/or open-ended is that it never explains anything about him beyond that, like what happened with the body afterward. While it remains unknown in the original version of the series, the <em>Re;surrection</em> movie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">confirms that Lelouch is alive</span>, revealing that Shirley (who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparedByTheAdaptation">Spared by the Adaptation</a> in the compilation movies) and Schneizel stowed away his body out of the country so that C.C. can resurrect him.

Lenalee and Lavi watched a recording of him apparently dying, but all that was left was a card and a bit of a bloodstain on the forest floor. Then BAM! Guess who wakes up by the end of the episode?
<ul><li> They never found <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cross Marian</span>'s body either. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His guards were put to sleep, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask">mask</a> was found with a bullet hole in it in the middle of a pool of blood large enough that the blood loss ought to have killed him, along with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a>. Recent chapter 222, which is 54 chapters after his disappearance, has confirmed that he's alive.

Intended as a one-shot character, he was apparently killed, but at an editor's behest Bob Kane scribbled up a final panel that left a back door open in case they wanted to bring back this clownish fellow. <br/><br/>Lampshaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ADeathInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ADeathInTheFamily">A Death in the Family</a></em>, where the Joker is in a helicopter that crashes into the sea. Batman shouts at Superman: "Find the body!", but he already knows that it won't be found, because the matters between him and the Joker always end up unresolved.

Problem is, you can't be sure he's dead even when you <em>do</em> have a body: Diabolik has occasionally left behind someone else's body in such a situation it would be mistaken for his, in one occasion fooling even <em>DNA tests</em> (he had swapped the sample that was to be tested), and not even seeing him being shot <em>and</em> checking the body is a guarantee of him dying (when that happened the guy who checked the body was an accomplice).

Ivan, his old "mentor", is constantly on the lookout for Jack Pherson, the closest thing to a true supervillain they ever faced, even though Pherson was last seen in an exploding building. While Ivan would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> in a straightforward superhero comic, in this one he just gets written off.

<ul><li> All <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a> are prime offenders, in order to allow for their equally copious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> moments. Many also subvert this, with a mangled body having been found and assumed to be that of the character in question. A few egregious examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em>. Characters go over waterfalls, drive off cliffs, or are lost in wreckage. Rarely is an established longterm character killed off without leaving such an opportunity to return.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a></em> has Colonel Mayer, who jumped into the ocean to avoid being captured by the police. He is presumed dead by the entire cast, but the viewers just KNOW he'll turn up again the second something is needed to drive (another) wedge between Luke and Noah.
</li><li> Colonel Mayer does return, but he gets sent back to prison.
</li><li> James Stenback has done this numerous times, having been a villain on the show for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">decades</a>. He is eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>, and everyone is shocked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">(and overjoyed)</a> that they have actually seen the body this time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DaysOfOurLives">Days of Our Lives</a></em>, with the original "death" of Roman Brady.
</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>By Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> The sixth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> ends with two baddies - Grechenko and Philip Bauer - supposedly dead, but as their bodies are never actually recovered (and Philip may well have the indestructible Bauer gene), they will almost certainly return in future seasons.
<ul><li> They don't. In fact, it is explicitly stated that Grechenko's body is found by CTU.
</li></ul></li><li> With the amount this occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, one would think people would be slower to assume a person's dead. Sara Lance, Malcolm Merlyn, Slade Wilson, and Isabel Rochev have all been "killed" at some point or another. This trope may even apply to Oliver himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Oliver's final death as the Spectre leaves no body behind, which is lampshaded. But, he's truly gone this time</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008">Ashes to Ashes (2008)</a></em>, it's said that the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeOnMars2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeOnMars2006">Life On Mars</a></em>, Sam Tyler, died in a car accident after spending seven years in 1973 onward. One year later, when Ashes begins, his body has yet to be found.
<ul><li> In the opening episode of Series 3 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alex rediscovers Sam's file and keeps it for later reading, and a new DCI alludes to Gene Hunt's secret, heavily implying that it may have to do with Sam's apparent death</span>.
<ul><li> It later transpires that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this death was indeed faked, however he had 'died' in that world, just in a different way</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAvengers1960s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAvengers1960s">The Avengers (1960s)</a></em>, Mrs. Peel's husband Peter is discovered to be alive in the Amazon after a plane crash years ago, signaling her character's exit from the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">John Sheridan</span>, on a hostile planet, dropped a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">nuclear bomb</a> on his own location. While jumping into a bottomless pit. The other cast members couldn't even make sense of the reports about what happened, let alone find the body. Some of them refused to believe that he was dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was. He got better.</span>
<ul><li> An established part of Minbari legend states that Valen, their warrior-prophet from 1,000 years previous, disappeared in this fashion, somewhere out in space. Some of them apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">believe he'll eventually return</a>... and they're right, in an odd sense.
</li><li> The same thing happens to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">John Sheridan</span> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a>. Because his ship was found with sealed airlocks and no trace of him on board, many believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingInTheMountain">he'll eventually return too</a>. And because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both characters make up part of the trio known as The One, many fans take it to mean the same thing also eventually happens to the third member, Delenn</span>.
</li><li> Delenn vocally invokes this trope when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lennier</span> goes missing in hyperspace and all the evidence says he can't have survived this long. (In this case, the audience already knows he's still alive, and how, but Delenn doesn't have this information.)
</li></ul></li><li> A grisly subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BadGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BadGirls">Bad Girls</a></em> - Prisoner Yevone Atkins. Apart from Jim Fenner (her prison officer killer) everyone else thinks she has escaped, which was her plan. The problem: the building plan she and her escape partner had used didn't feature a wall which turned a corridor into a cell because the door to the corridor only opened from the outside. Fenner shut the door behind her and left her there. Her escape partner after spending weeks in solitary confinement (for a different matter) saw the escape route as still being viable as it wasn't discovered by the prison officers. She goes to make her escape only to find the wall blocking her path and Yevone's rotting corpse.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers">Band of Brothers</a></em> when Easy Company is pulling out of a Dutch town swarming with Germans. Denver "Bull" Randleson was separated from the main force and forced to hide until he can escape. Meanwhile his friends are trying to organize a rescue, and when told he was probably dead "Wild Bill" Guarnere responded, "If there ain't no body then there ain't nobody dead."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em>
<ul><li> "Better Luck Next Time". Catwoman falls into what Batman says is a bottomless pit, and he says that she probably went straight to the bottom. She re-appears again in the 2nd season episode "Hot Off the Griddle".
</li><li> "Scat! Darn Catwoman". At the end of the episode, Catwoman falls off a building into a river. Her body is never recovered and Batman says he "doesn't think she'll be bothering us anymore", so he considers her to be dead. However, she appears again in the episode "Catwoman Goes to College".
</li></ul></li><li> In the Season 1 finale (which also ended the series) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blade">Blade</a></em>, Krista throws <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chase</span> down the stairwell (a pretty big drop). A few minutes later, she looks down and doesn't see either <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chase</span>'s body or ash. Van Sciver tells her that even if either of those things were found, he'd still look over his shoulder for the rest of his immortal life.
</li><li> On a Behind The Scenes video for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tio</span>'s actor jokes that, even though he was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">inches away from a large explosion</span>, this trope applies because the dead body wasn't shown onscreen.
</li><li> What with the deaths and returns of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Master, Angel, Spike, and Drusilla</span>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> variant seems to be "never count a vampire dead unless their bodies turn to dust". And even then, there are ways around it (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">case in point: Darla, who for the record has died <em>four times</em></span>).
<ul><li> Invoked improperly after the Spike/Drusilla fight in "What's My Line, Part Two", which takes place in a burning church. Later, in "Surprise", the Scoobies suspect Dru may have survived, with Buffy saying, "We never found a body." Oddly, no one points out that vampires don't <em>leave</em> bodies, and checking for vampire dust in a <em>burned-down church</em> is nigh-impossible. Still, points for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>, though.
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em> episode "Dead to Rights", a building explodes, killing recurring villain Larry and two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> security guards. However, the next day's newspaper headline simply said that two people were killed in the blast, indicating that Larry (who makes a habit of this) is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode a murder makes no sense... until near the end, Castle realizes this about an important participant in an event that took place 20 years earlier:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Ryan</strong>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Susan Mailer</span>, alive? <br/><strong>Castle</strong>: Her body was never found. <br/><strong>Beckett</strong>: Yeah, because she was vaporized in the explosion. <br/><strong>Castle</strong>: Well, maybe she was thrown clear.
</div></li><li> In a much later episode, Castle shoots a serial killer several times, knocking him off a bridge. They never find the body—in fact, Beckett goes so far as to state, direct quote, "they never found the body". Castle postulates that the killer had planned the whole thing in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">attempt to disappear</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Beautifully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em> in regards to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daniel Shaw</span>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Morgan</strong>: You checked for a pulse right? <br/><strong>Chuck</strong>: ...Well he fell into a river. <br/><strong>Morgan</strong>: He fell into a river? Of course <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shaw</span>'s alive. Haven't you ever seen a John Carpenter movie?
</div></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> episode "Blood Relations" features a killer more inspired by slasher movies than their typical fare, so it's no surprise that his body isn't found in the end, though most of the team is confident that he is in fact dead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> confirms that he managed to survive.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> episode "The List", the cops did find a torched car filled with the victim's blood and believed that proved she was dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She wasn't, and the steps she takes to fake her death, including <em>murdering her own sister</em>, are so awful that they make her lover/partner-in-crime realize she can't be trusted.</span>

Taylor's wife died on 9/11 and not a speck of her DNA has ever been found. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Interestingly, a flashback shows that she escaped the first tower's collapse...</span> Considering that, you know, 9/11 actually happened and thousands of real people died and haven't been found, she's probably not going to show up with amnesia in the season finale. Fan fic writers, on the other hand...
<ul><li> She did actually tell Mac during their cell phone call that she wanted to go back and help other people. Mac told her to stay out where it was safe, and then the call was cut off. So, it's possible she died going back to help others.
</li><li> Her death does seem more confirmed as of the season 8 finale since Mac saw her during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience">Near-Death Experience</a> and she gave him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsNotYourTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsNotYourTime">It Is Not Your Time</a>.

Fleeing to Mexico, Fernando <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">hid all evidence</a> of his first marriage from his family, until a letter from Sevilla turned up indicating that she may have survived.

</li><li> ...And Romana, meanwhile, had gone to E-Space some time before then, and it's never been stated<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0w09x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0w09x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0w09x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the TV series, anyway; the novels and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho">Big Finish Doctor Who</a></em> audios made her President of Gallifrey</span> if she came back for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen Time War</a> or not.

</li></ul></li><li> The TV miniseries of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dune">Dune</a></em>:
<ul><li> Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, upon receiving news that Paul and Jessica Atreides were dead after flying into a sandstorm, asks explicitly, "You'veseen the bodies?" He was right to doubt. In the novel it is more explicit, but his entire plan is based upon the fact that this means of executing Paul and Jessica would not <em>leave</em> bodies. Once his underlings are gone he himself states that they are undoubtedly dead, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">nothing could possibly survive a sandstorm</a>, and he was stressing the need to find the bodies as an educational experience to never take anything for granted, not because he actually feels this situation requires a body to be definite.
</li><li> They do, at least, recover the body of Duncan Idaho, even though we're not told or shown it (there probably wasn't much left after he received a missile to the face). It was a few years, but the Tleilaxu manage to regrow the remains into a ghola.
</li></ul></li><li> The first death of Dennis "Dirty Den" Watts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EastEnders">EastEnders</a></em> was perhaps the longest gap between killed and brought back, 14 years passed.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Irene Adler</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em>. All that was found was a pool of her blood, more than a person could survive losing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sure enough, she turns up alive in the penultimate episode of the first season. Furthermore, Sherlock eventually discovers that the man who supposedly killed her was actually set up by the mysterious Moriarty... which turns out to be Irene's true identity. She has been playing him all along, even managing to put on a very convincing American accent for the role of Irene.</span>
</li><li> Scorpius was shot and <em>buried</em> on-screen in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> but that didn't stop him from coming back anyway. Likely due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">his huge popularity with fans</a>. The fact that he came back only<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> two</span> episodes later makes it pretty clear that this wasn't as much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> as one would think.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Benjen Stark's horse returned riderless and two of his comrades corpses are found  reanimated by White Walkers. While he is officially only missing in action, his comrades-in-arms are not optimistic and he is 'presumed dead'. He returns in Season 6, alive and kicking, so to speak.
</li><li> Syrio Forel. We don't see him losing the fight, and there's no mention of his head being with the others on the spears. In "The First of His Name", The Hound inadvertently throws gas on this particular fire by pointing out how crappy a fighter Meryn Trant, the man who supposedly killed Syrio off-screen, really is. If Syrio was able to beat five Lannister soldiers with a wooden sword, he should have been able to beat Trant without breaking a sweat. In the books, one of the more common fan theories is that Syrio was actually Jaqen H'ghar in disguise. The second season might actually support this: in his last scene, Jaqen bids farewell to Arya by calling her "Arya Stark", a name that Arya never told him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven">Haven</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">The Bolt Gun Killer</a> tries to escape the heroes in a motorboat, they shoot the engine and it explodes. Since they don't find any remains, they assume the Killer survived and is still at large. They are correct.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em>, involving two men put on trial for murdering one of their business partners, with the fact that the body was never found raising questions about whether a murder was even committed. In his closing argument, the defence attorney dramatically declares that the 'victim' is in fact about to walk right through the courtroom doors, prompting everyone to turn in astonishment... but when he doesn't show, the attorney confidently declares that, since everyone was nevertheless convinced he would, the only possible option is to acquit his clients since no one can be certain that he is dead. When, against all probability, the jury convicts, the astonished attorneys corner one of the jurors, who reveals that while everyone was looking at the doors, she was looking at the defendants, who were the only people in the courtroom not to turn around.
<div class="indent"><strong>Juror:</strong> They knew he wasn't going to be walking through those doors.
</div></li><li> Simon Kingdom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kingdom">Kingdom</a></em> is presumed dead after leaving his belongings on the beach and walking into the sea.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He comes back in the first season finale, and in the end of the second season he disappears in a flood.</span>
</li><li> This happens to Nicole Wallace in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderCriminalIntent">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a></em> episode "Great Barrier". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She gets better.</span>
<ul><li> Nicole again and is Goren's reaction on when Nicole Wallace's heart is found, but a lab tech confirms it is, indeed, a DNA match. (Of course, if anyone could spoof that...)
<ul><li> It is later confirmed that Goren's teacher admitted he did in fact kill her.
</li><li> This confirmation is sketchy, since that entire conversation, as well as previous ones, make it clear that the guy is absolutely out of his mind. He may have only thought he killed Nicole, and Nicole is certainly capable of using that to her advantage. Since the series has now ended, we will probably never truly know whether Nicole really is dead or not.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the suspects in "Revolution", Axel Caspers, had previously been implicated in a firebombing which is presumed to have killed a banker, his wife, and their toddler daughter, but Nichols learns that only the adults were positively identified. And it just so happens that Caspers has a daughter exactly the same age as the banker's child despite the fact that Caspers was serving a prison sentence at the time the child would have had to have been concieved...
</li></ul></li><li> One of the earliest mysteries on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> involved Jack seeing hallucinations of his dead father on the island. When Jack finally found his father's coffin, the body was not inside. Over the course of the series, Jack's father started appearing more and more often, and to other character to whom he may or may not have any connection, and even began interacting with them, casting obvious doubt on whether or not "hallucination" is really a good term to use.
<ul><li> Later, Eko discovers his dead brother's corpse in the drug smuggling plane. But when he returns sometime later, the body has vanished. Suddenly, his brother starts walking around and interacting with Eko. Eko finally has a conversation with the "hallucination" of his brother and addresses him as such. The person then replies "you speak to me as if I were your brother" and walks off, leaving Eko rather confused. When Eko pursues the individual, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the smoke monster appears and kills him</span>. This scene cemented in many fans' minds the theory that the smoke monster can impersonate others if it has a body to steal.
<ul><li> Confirmed in season 5, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alex</span> is quite clearly the Smoke Monster judging <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ben</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> This theory ends up being thrown for a loop in season 5. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Locke</span>'s body is brought back to the island, and keeping with this theory, most fans assumed he'd come back to life.

<ul><li> After Blight is trapped in a sinking/exploding submarine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingCritical">Going Critical</a>, Batman drops by Paxton Powers' office. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalBroadcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalBroadcast">Coincidental Broadcast</a> mentions that Blight's remains have yet to be found. Paxton smirks and says "So, he melted with the sub." Batman responds "Sure he did," and walks off. Possibly a subversion, since Blight never appeared again on the show. He did return in the comic books based on the series, but was frozen at the end of the issue.
</li><li> The situation is repeated in "Inqueling" after Inque's daughter Deanna doublecrosses her mother. In an echo of the previous scene with Paxton Powers, Batman turns up to warn Deanna not to get too comfortable: "She's been dead before." Sure enough, Inque reappears in "The Call, Part 1," proving Terry right. (Deanna's fate is never mentioned. She's last seen reacting fearfully to every shadow, as her shapeshifting mother could be literally anywhere.) The storyline with Deanna is actually resolved in the comics, where an origin of Inque is also revealed. In the comic story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deanna is in the hospital, with the same disease her mother had that forced her to adopt her powers, and Inque seems willing to forgive, pausing to feed a small droplet of her own substance into Deanna's IV cord before vanishing</span>.

Gordon does point out that a body was never recovered, but doubts Harley would be starting trouble again after decades. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She is alive, and is not amused with the criminal activity of her granddaughters.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> A crime in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipNDaleRescueRangers">Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</a></em> episode "To The Rescue" has all the earmarks of a crime committed by Aldrin Klordane, who is supposed to have drowned over a year ago. However... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he still manages to be the mastermind behind a new crime, in addition to very much alive</span>. Detective Drake points out the possibility of his survival using the title of this trope.

There was no sign of Superman's body or anything that might have been his body but Batman was the only one who saw it as a reason to doubt Superman actually dying. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/VandalSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/VandalSavage">Vandal Savage</a> also figured out Superman was alive (he was sent to the future) but it's not clear if he already suspected it from the beginning.

The Spartan King, however, believes that Jack survived, as anyone as badass as Jack wouldn't die like that.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceGhost">Space Ghost</a></em>. In the episodes in which they originally appeared, most of the major villains (Brak, Creature King, Metallus, Moltar, Spider Woman and Zorak) suffered defeats in which they might have died but no body was found. Space Ghost even lampshades this: when Jan or Jace asks him if a villain survived or might return, he admits that they could have survived or that they might see that villain again.

All that remained was his business suit that he had hung up earlier <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the skeletal remains of his right hand clutching the gem fragment that forms the center of Ludo's wand</span>. Toffee was shown to have impressive regenerative powers (regrowing an arm in seconds after Star vaporized it) and later details <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> about his battles against Star's mother</span> describe him as "the immortal monster", so his death remains up in the air. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out yes, he <em>did</em> die, but he sealed his spirit into the missing half of Star's wand. He had to wait for someone to take his discarded arm so that he could free himself from the crystal and possess his new host.</span>

They'd had an argument over Bismuth's new weapon designed to shatter Gems, which Rose refused to approve for reasons relating to her "all life is precious" worldview, and Bismuth believed was necessary for them to win the war they were fighting. Bismuth attacked Rose, and Rose poofed her in response and hid her away inside Lion's mane. She could never tell her teammates what happened, given Bismuth's popularity, and so Bismuth was presumed to be missing and likely dead.</span>
</li><li> 1973/74 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em> episode "Dr. Pelagian's War".

Aquaman suspects that he's actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Dr. Pelagian, but an investigation discovers that Dr. Hillbrand died five years earlier in a deep sea diving accident. Oddly enough, his body was never discovered. Guess who Dr. Pelagian turns out to be?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em>, Young Lance notes at his Father's funeral that "He's not even in there" (the coffin). At first, Lance believed he might still be alive.

Ironically, it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>did</em> actually die, but he manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">come back anyways</a> with some help from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Raven's demon father</a></span>.
</li><li> Wreck-Gar of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> is seemingly killed when microbots react negatively with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">backpack</a> and he falls into a river. Ratchet is unable to recover his remains and only manages fish out trash. The episode ends with him at the bottom of the river trapped with no way of escape...until the next season where he simply frees himself when he hears of a new opportunity to be a hero.
</li><li> This wound up being very useful in the 90's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> cartoon. Initially, they intended to kill off Morph for real, but, after he "died" off screen, they just happened to never show his body or say what happened to it (probably for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">censorship</a> reasons). As a result, when the character became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">unexpectedly popular</a>, season 2 was able to easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retcon</a> Morph as having been rescued by Mister Sinister. The <em>X-Men Adventures</em> comic, a spin-off of the show, winds up partially averting this trope. In it, Morph is given an <em>on screen</em> death, with Beast at his side, and Gyrich even mentions having possession of his corpse. This is completely ignored come season 2 of the comic.

Occurs when no identifiable remains have been found, but either the circumstances (i.e., a plane crash) make it extremely unlikely that they have survived, or they have been missing for a very long time (typically at least seven years) and there is no evidence that they could still be alive. Of course, there have been very rare cases where people have been found to be alive after being legally declared dead, such as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Campden_Wonder">a particularly infamous one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that occurred in the 17th century

Although it has been officially confirmed, some still have doubt due to the fact that the Obama Administration never released any pictures of Osama's body before it was given a burial at sea. Not that a post-mortem photograph would have helped much; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">he took a bullet in the head.</a>
