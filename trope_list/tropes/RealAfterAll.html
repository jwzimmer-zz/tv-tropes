If an episode revolves around a haunting/alien visitation/lake monster sighting/whatever that turns out to be a hoax, the episode will end with a shot of a <em>real</em> ghost/alien visitor/lake monster/whatever.
</p><p>A variation is for the episode to end with the investigators remarking on one detail of the hoax they found particularly impressive, only for the hoaxer to say, "But... that wasn't me." Or, in haunting cases, for the investigators to remark how helpful Bob was, only for one of the locals to say, "Bob? But he's been dead for five years." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaveUpTooSoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaveUpTooSoon">Sometimes, the characters won't be around to see it</a>, especially if a real sighting would bring an end to a long-running mystery. Many times, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">"Scooby-Doo" Hoax</a> about a lake monster will end with the real one coming out of the water to watch the heroes leave.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Batman">Batman</a></em> manga story "The Monster of Gore Bay", a gang of criminals use a mechanical fake sea monster to cause chaos so that they can commit crimes, only for their machine to finally be attacked by a real sea monster.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinosaurKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DinosaurKing">Dinosaur King</a></em> features the Loch Ness Monster, sightings of which are initially thought to be the work of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">the Alpha Gang</a>'s submarine. The Alpha Gang themselves are only there because they believe that Nessie is really one of the dinosaurs that escaped from its card. Sure enough, the characters do face a dinosaur on the loch... but in the very last scene, after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">dinosaur</a> has been safely captured and returned to its card, the shadow of the real Nessie appears menacingly in the mist.

Fumoffu</a></em> episode "The Patient of Darkness" uses the "hoaxer goes 'but that wasn't me'" version—subverted when it turns out that the last "ghost" really was a living person the hoaxers just didn't know about.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kagewani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kagewani">Kagewani</a></em> has each episode ending with the revelation that the claims of a cryptid attack were actually real.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KissHimNotMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KissHimNotMe">Kiss Him, Not Me</a></em>, the group gets stranded and separated on an island, and experience supernatural phenomenon. Among them, Serinuma and Mutsumi get attacked by a vengeful samurai's ghost, but manage to fend him off and then banish him using talismans they had bought earlier. When the group is rescued, they are informed that they had mistakenly eaten hallucinogenic mushrooms earlier. Everyone dismisses their experiences due to this, but Mutsumi reaches into his pocket and finds his talisman has the same damage it took from blocking the samurai's sword strikes.
</li><li> The Florian Triangle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is a place where nearly a hundred ships go missing every year. In the course of the Thriller Bark arc, we learn that the arc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Gecko Moria has been assaulting ships that pass through and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow">stealing their crews' shadows</a> to give rise to an army of zombies. At the arc's very end however, a huge shadow watches the crew leave and the narration reveals that something has been destroying ships <em>long</em> before Gecko Moria ever set up shop.

This leads the student council dorm members to look around the surrounding forest before returning to the dorm. When these 'green lights' appear in front of them, they conclude that those were just fireflies.. before they realize these are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillOTheWisp">Will-o'-the-Wisp</a></em>.

At the end of the episode, as the narrator comments that aliens don't really exist, it's shown that the events are being watched by some real aliens in a real flying saucer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SengokuOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SengokuOtome">Sengoku Otome</a></em>, everybody gets trapped by samurai ghosts. After managing to appease them, the ghosts tell Nobunaga that she is the one destined to rule the land before departing. Later, Ieyasu meets her minion Hanzo and thanks her for the great special effects and using the fake samurai ghosts to stoke Nobunaga's ego so she will fall into her plan. Hanzo replies that she just arrived and didn't have time to set up the fake samurai ghosts. Though a little unnerved, Ieyasu shrugs it off, since the real ghosts helped her manipulate Nobunaga anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SquidGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SquidGirl">Squid Girl</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goro spends most of chapter 232 freaking out over a ghost story Eiko told him, involving a girl who disappeared while looking for her red sandal. After Eiko tells him the story was made up, he finally starts to calm down, but then we see a suspicious lone red sandal drifting ashore.
</li><li> In one chapter, the gang freaks out over a supposed ghost picture, which turns out to just be Takeru's hand as he waved to try and be in the picture in time before it was taken. But the end shows that there's also a suspicious, disembodied grinning face in there too...

The murders turn out to be a hoax, but at the end, the ghost briefly makes an appearance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em>, everyone goes to investigate the old school building, which is rumored to be haunted by a ghost. It's eventually revealed that it's actually just a group of stray aliens who played up the ghost rumors in order to squat on the property. However, in the end, it's revealed that there actually is a ghost haunting the place. Said ghost, Oshizu, ends up eventually becoming part of the main cast.

Suddenly they hear jingling bells out the window. When they go outside to check, they find several gift-wrapped packages with their names on them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBasilBrushShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBasilBrushShow">The Basil Brush Show</a></em> had a Christmas episode where Santa gets food poisoning from the cafe and the gang is forced to make and deliver presents in one night. The next morning when Santa comes round, everyone finds out that he is a department store Santa. After everyone leaves they find the flat full of presents and hear a loud "ho-ho-ho!". It transpires the department store Santa was the real Santa after all.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baywatch">Baywatch</a></em> episode "Strangers Among Us", a group of half-crazy UFO believers cause problems for the lifeguards as they misinterpret water phenomena on the beach as signs of aliens and almost drown and so on. They are led by the more sensible Dr. Faye Taylor, who has a more scientific view on UFOs. All seems to be normal until the very last minutes of the episode, where she disappears without a trace during something resembling a strange weather phenomenon.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Benson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Benson">Benson</a></em> involved a supposed UFO sighting. At the end, Benson and the Governor are out in a field and get flashed from overhead by a series of strange lights.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, a person is found dead in the middle of nowhere by a ufologist. At the end of the episode, Brennan and Booth manage to find the real killer. They are lying on the hood of a car in a field, stargazing and talking about whether or not aliens are real. Just then, all the crickets and other natural sounds disappear, leaving both of them a little freaked out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">complete silence</a>.
</li><li> In another, a murderer uses a myth about a witch in the woods (an intentional parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject">The Blair Witch Project</a></em>) to cover up the unintentional killing of his filmmaker brother. At the end though, Angela and Hodgins see what appears to be a <em>real ghost</em> on footage of the murder. They promptly decide to never mention it again.
</li><li> Booth is kidnapped and imprisoned on a derelict ship by the Grave Digger and interacts with a soldier who died by Booth's side in combat. This is initially presented as a hallucination but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to escape the ship requires physical strength beyond that of a single person. The next day Brennan interacts with the same apparent ghost.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> has quite a number of episodes that pit Castle's child-like belief in the supernatural against Beckett's rational skepticism, but most of them usually go for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane</a> ending. However, there are two notable exceptions:
<ul><li> In the 6th season episode "Time Will Tell", an episode about (gasp) time travel, Beckett <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spills her coffee on a letter that had been a key piece of evidence in the case after the case is over. The murderer had been using a stained copy of that letter to try to track down an intended victim but the cops had used the pristine original to find him first. The stain Beckett made that afternoon matched the one on the murderer's copy even though his copy predated the spill of the coffee.</span> The incident is not really "in your face" proof, but it is chilling because the only possible explanations are "time travel" or "1 in a million coincidence".
</li><li> But the 7th season episode "Clear and Present Danger" takes the cake for playing this trope straight as an arrow when it turns out that the victim really was killed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"the invisible man". (Well, an invisible <em>wo</em>man). A scientist working for a shadowy government agency made a breakthrough and had created a functional invisibility suit which was then, in an ironic twist, used to murder him. Beckett adjusted reasonably quickly to the reality of invisible people walking about and Castle's paranoia and creation of an "invisible man trap" suddenly seemed unusually reasonable.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> British medical soap/drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Casualty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Casualty">Casualty</a></em> pulls this one once.

An instant later, the Skipper, dressed normally, emerges — from the opposite direction — out the jungle, carrying the firewood that he went to get a moment ago.

At the end of the episode, Sophia reveals that the "spaceship" was just an experimental aircraft that the military didn't want anyone knowing about. When Dorothy goes out to break the news to Rose, the two sit for a while on the lanai, and Dorothy drops off to sleep...just in time to miss the sky suddenly flood with light and sound. Rose sits back in her chair and smiles, convinced that she's seen the real thing.
</li><li> In a non-supernatural example, Sophia, who's been struggling with memory issues, clings to the fact that her late husband carved a big heart that read "SAL LOVES SOPHIA" on the pantry door in their apartment in Brooklyn. When Dorothy and Sophia visit, they find the Petrillo family height chart instead, which deeply upsets her. However, at the end of the episode—and after a visit from a ghostly version of Sal himself—Sophia discovers the heart in question on the door of the bedroom closet.
</li><li> Both Blanche and Sophia have ghostly visitations in a Season 7 episode. Blanche insists that she hears the voice of her dead grandmother in her old room at the family plantation, which is set to be torn down; at the end of the episode, a set of wind chimes Blanche took from the room swings in the breeze, suggesting that Blanche is right. Meanwhile, Sophia has a near-death experience and talks with Sal in Heaven, only to be revived. When Dorothy tries to explain this away as a hallucination brought on by lack of oxygen, Sophia teasingly calls her "Spumoni Face," a nickname which Sal told her about while she was temporarily deceased. Dorothy's shocked—she's <em>never</em> told her mother about that nickname...

Piper begins doing various jobs and schemes while Jake continues to believe she's wasting her time.

</li><li> The Holy Grail in "Murdoch and the Temple of Death" is strongly implied to be the real thing. The killer jumps off a 60-foot cliff thinking it will save him, despite Murdoch telling the man to stop, and as Murdoch looks down on the man's corpse, a thunderclap sounds (seemingly in daylight) and Murdoch reacts to it. Later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Iris Bajali</span> steals it from the station house and flees with Murdoch in pursuit; he tells her it belongs to God, and when she shouts back, "There is no God," she is struck by lightning and dies. Later still, a museum staffer accidentally knocks it over and disposes of the clay outer layer, leaving a metal chalice standing on the shelf that appears bathed in a (heavenly?) shaft of light.

</li><li> Yet another episode involved a creepy castle with several characters, including the one Sam leaps into, believing themselves to be vampires. One of them gets zapped by lightning, after which Sam triumphantly takes off the dead guy's fake vampire teeth. Just before leaping, he looks into a metallic tray and doesn't see his own reflection. The previous episode ended with Dr. Ruth being replaced in the waiting room by a man with vampire fangs. It doesn't seem likely that fake teeth would be transported there.
</li><li> There's also an episode where a Yeti helps rescue someone, they only see it at the very end.
</li><li> In "It's a Wonderful Leap", Sam leaps into a cab driver named Max in 1958 who's due to be murdered. Sam is thrown by the arrival of Angelita, who claims to be an angel. Sam and Al naturally assume she's a nutcase, especially given how she can see and hear Al (as mentally addled people can). In the end, Sam saves Max's life with Angelita telling him she has to leave and once she does, everyone in this time will forget she was ever here. She stuns him and Al by calling "Max" Sam and "who do you think I was sent here to help?" She goes as Al asks if Sam is going to follow her. "Follow who?"

After they left, that final claim would come true (Penelope shrinking down as she took a phone call, or Liza herself—carrying the tomato—bursting through the door and declaring that she wanted to have a girls' night out).

George and Jerry are never able to find the missing <em>Tropic of Cancer</em>, but as the episode ends, we cut to Mr. Hayman muttering to himself in an alley, with the weather-beaten book at his side.

As he's kicked out, he drops the photo.

Myles assumes this is one of the team's practical jokes so, when the interviewer comes around, amps up his usual arrogant persona to insult and berate her as a fool ("I am Einstein with a gun!") and celebrates not falling for the "joke."

Later Zack and Cody go back to get Cody's blanket, and a woman (whose portrait is in the room) walks up to them and hands them the blanket. After they thank her, she walks into the portrait. The episode ends with Zack and Cody running and screaming. Interestingly, the portrait did come to life and speak to Zack while the prank was going on (she even said "<em>they're</em> out to get you", in retrospect a warning that it was a prank by his friends), but Zack never brings this up while they're explaining the hoax to him.

A few unreliable accounts and an unfruitful search lead to nothing more than an empty chamber where it seemed the government had created a living environment for this so-called alien, which is empty. The episode then rolls into the average fight scene at the climax of the story like all others, and has a fairly mellow ending... until an old tape is found that was supposed to be destroyed by the government, and it shows evidence of a real alien being discovered, though only a hand to maintain some realism and avoid dipping into science fiction.

At the end, they turned out to belong to a stray cat, leading Joe to believe that it was just a cat he saw all those years ago, ending his fear.

They find out Anteus' other son, Mael, jealous of his brother, drugged his father and used a megaphone to fake God's voice and order the sacrifice. As Anteus captures Ikus and steels himself to do the sacrifice, Xena battles Mael while Gabrielle tries to reach the megaphone to imitate God and call it off.

</li><li> In another episode, after Creepie and friends fail to find Bugfoot, the camera zooms out to show that the wilderness they're in is actually located on said giant arthropod's back.

Creepie then goes about her business, only for Gina's ghost to spawn as soon as she leaves the scene.
</li><li> "Children of the Pumpkin Patch" has Creepie and friends going to a Pumpkin Patch of course, worried about the scarecrow nearby that reminds them of an antagonist from a horror flick. The scarecrow indeed appears to be haunted, only for it to be revealed to be some guy trying to scare away potential customers. At the end of the episode, the gang leave the pumpkin patch, only to see Chris-Alice's mom sitting in the back with them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoIsDriving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoIsDriving">instead of behind the wheel</a>.

<ul><li> "Haunted Train" was an episode where Arnold, Helga, and Gerald heard the story of a train that takes you straight to a "fiery underworld" with the ghost of the conductor who'd supposedly driven the original off the tracks and down into the underworld. The kids go check it out and sure enough a train shows up and takes them through a hellish scene, just like in the story. It turns out it was just an average train that passed through a steelworks. At the end the train races past with the ghost conductor sitting on the front, playing accordion and singing the urban legend.
</li><li> "Wheezin' Ed" tells the story of the gangster Wheezin' Ed and his treasure, located out on Elk Island and hidden in one of the caves. Intrigued by the promise of treasure, Arnold, Gerald, and several of the supporting characters head out to the caves where instead of a ghost they come across two counterfeiters. They end up saved and the counterfeiters arrested while the scene ends with the sound of Wheezin' Ed's laughter echoing through the cave.
</li><li> "Ghost Bride" finds Gerald telling the story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsForKids">a woman who, left on her wedding day by a groom in love with her sister, puts on her wedding dress, grabs an ax and kills both her ex-fiancee and sister before jumping out the window to her own death.</a> Every year on the same day, the ghost of the bride returns to the cemetery looking for fresh victims, humming the wedding march the whole time. Of course the children decide to meet up that night at the cemetery. The boys are then chased through the graveyard by Helga dressed up as the bride, and later by Curly. After agreeing that there's no ghost bride, the group minus Curly leave...and then he hears humming.
</li><li> "Headless Cabbie" has the boys at the sleepover, telling scary stories. Arnold tells of a cabbie who finds himself approached by a woman, mourning the loss of her little dog. She asks for a ride through the park and gets into the carriage, offering the cabbie her scarf because it's such a cold night. When she hears barking she becomes mad, encouraging him to go dangerously fast, until a man with a golden hook for an arm causes him to swerve off the road, the scarf getting caught in the tree and taking his head off. When the boys go through the same park for ice cream later...they believe they're being chased by the cabbie who is eventually revealed to be Ernie, driving a carriage to earn more money. It ends with him being approached by the same woman, mourning the loss of her dog and offering him her scarf.
</li><li> In "Four-Eyed Jack" from season 2, Grandpa tells Arnold and Gerald a story about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who lived in the boarding house and was killed by an exploding bean experiment. Afterwards weird things start to happen that fit the tale.

After the villain (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unaffiliated to the hoaxers</span>) is arrested, the gang sees pictures taken by a previously lost underwater camera taken at a much greater depth than the submarines could have operated at, which show flippers and other body parts of a completely different entity.

Lisa and Bart, playing Hansel and Gretel, are captured by a witch, who claims she needs to get ready before her boyfriend comes over. She says that his name is "George Cauldron," a deliberate reference to Jan Brady saying she had a boyfriend named "George Glass" after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName">seeing a drinking glass on her nightstand</a>.

At the end of the episode Cartman declares that he actually learned a lesson from this and promises to clean up his life, lose weight, and become nicer. A man in a nice suit then walks up congratulating him on this decision, and introduces himself as the future Cartman, who considers this to be the defining moment of his life and assures the present Cartman that if he continues on this path, he'll grow up to own a time travel business and be very rich. Present Cartman assumes he's just another actor trying to trick him and says he's now going to live his life even worse than before out of spite. After he walks away, the future Cartman turns into a fat mechanic.
</li><li> In "Manbearpig" Al Gore is depicted as being an idiot for believing in the title monster. In the later "Imaginationland" episodes, Manbearpig is depicted as an evil resident, showing that he is imaginary. In "Time To Get Cereal", he finally appears in the real world causing havoc.

<ul><li> In the very first episode, "Help Wanted", SpongeBob wants to become a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, which Mr. Krabs considers him unfit for due to his clumsiness and naivete. With Squidward's help, Krabs sends him on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt">Snipe Hunt</a> to find a seemingly nonexistent "hydrodynamic spatula with port and starboard attachments" ("And don't forget the turbo drive!"). It turns out said spatula actually does exist, and SpongeBob found the last one in stock at the Barg'N Mart, much to the shock of both Squidward and Mr. Krabs. It was also helpful because they had to attend to a sea of hungry anchovies that moment.
</li><li> In "Christmas Who?", after Squidward dresses as Santa and gives away all his stuff as gifts to the entire town, the real Santa comes and thanks him.
</li><li> In "Yeti Krabs", Mr. Krabs tries to scare Squidward and SpongeBob into working harder by making up a story about a Yeti Krab who tracks down and eats lazy workers, along with anyone in the vicinity. When a real Yeti Krab coincidentally shows up after Mr. Krabs leaves, SpongeBob is terrified and runs around doing busywork to placate it, while Squidward, who never believed Mr. Krabs' story in the first place, simply assumes it's him in a costume. The Yeti Krab, who's merely hungry and was attracted to the Krusty Krab by the smell of food, eventually does try to eat all three of them out of desperation, but SpongeBob figures out the problem and wins it over with some fresh Krabby Patties.
</li><li> In "One Krab's Trash", Mr. Krabs makes up a story about how the soda drink hat he sold to SpongeBob is cursed to scare it off of him as he found out it's worth a lot of money. He claims it belonged to someone named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">Smitty WarbenJagerManJensen.</a> It turns out the story he made up on the spot is true.

Little kids know that if they're bad, <strong>The Stump</strong> will come and carry them off. Older kids know that The Stump is just a fable used to make little kids behave. Guess who's right?
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em>, a monster hunter comes to look for the "green man in the woods" after the turtles are spotted and videotaped; about halfway through the turtles discover that the green man is real and have to keep both it and themselves out of her reach.

The Boggy Ben he faces turns out to be Tygra in a costume, as they were trying to teach Lion-O a lesson. Just as they explain this, the real Boggy Ben shows up and attacks them.
</li><li> In "The Horror of Hook Mountain", Snowman rants about a monster called the Sparklemaw, but Tygra thinks he's making it up. It shows up at the end.

This confuses the Tick, who refuses to fight even when his fellow superheroes are viciously attacked by a dozen guys in Santa costumes: "Odds are it wasn't the real Santa, but how can you ever be sure?" Santa later appears, with an Elf Secret Service team, compulsively hands out gifts such as pencil sets, and tells the Tick to get a grip.

She eventually discovers that the "Yeti" is actually one of her father's old colleagues, Dr. McWhirter who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">dresses up like a monster</a> to protect the snow leopards. At the climax, of the episode, a Yeti approaches and helps Eliza fight off some greedy land developers. Later, Eliza thanks McWhirter, but he explains that he wasn't wearing his suit at the time and was instead in the snow leopards' cave, tending to them. Eliza ponders what this means, and a loud roar sounds from the mountains...
</li><li> Another episode "Spirited Away" takes place in Mexico had Eliza running into a friendly old woman who helps her solve her problem of the week. The episode's ending reveals that the woman has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">been dead for years.</a> Fitting, as the episode was centered on the Day of the Dead. In fact, the woman had been helping Eliza because Eliza had kindly decorated her gravestone with flowers as it appeared no one had done so in years.
