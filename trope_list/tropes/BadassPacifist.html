</li><li> Yugi Mutou of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> fame. He might beat you in a children's card game, sure, but he'll never use violence— he hates it— and, for the most part, tries to talk villains out of their evil ways, even befriending them.
</li><li> Vash the Stampede from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>. Anyone who can win so many battles without spilling so much as a drop of blood deserves all kinds of respect.
</li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu">Angel Densetsu</a></em>, Kitano Seiichiro, mostly qualifies for this. His fighting style consists of letting people hit him until they grow tired. Usually because he misunderstands the situation and believes himself to be deserving of the pain or, in one instance, *not* understanding the reason he's being attacked, and thus refusing to give up. Of course, he typically finishes off his opponents with a double palm strike, but he is actually attempting to push them out of the way, for one reason or another, not hit them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Only towards the end of the series does he intentionally hit enemies once and even then only in order to prevent further violence and protect his friends.</span>
</li><li> The main character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoldenBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoldenBoy">Golden Boy</a></em> is one of these as well — or at least is aspiring to be one. When he was attacked and resorted to punching his assailant out, he revealed that — among the other training he's done — he is a master black belt, but felt that he has failed all of his learning by resorting to violence, and that he still has more to learn.
</li><li> Yashiro Isana in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em> will use his powers to block attacks (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParasolOfPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParasolOfPain">with his parasol</a>), but he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">doesn't attack enemies</a>. His plans and solutions to the problems in the story instead mostly involve him getting <em>himself</em> hurt, and taking the bad guys (or their phlebotinum) with him. It's a good thing he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> immortal.</span>
</li><li> Yako Katsuragi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MajinTanteiNougamiNeuro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MajinTanteiNougamiNeuro">Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro</a></em> becomes this during the course of the series, able to use her ability to understand people and her sincerity to stop a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> expert, an AI of nearly unlimited intelligence based off of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a>, a shape-shifting superhuman killer who can read minds, and an entire rebel army. She gains the respect of the most powerful being in the human and demon worlds, and at the end of the manga, she has become world-famous for her abilities.

<ul><li> There's also N during the <em>Episode N</em> part of Best Wishes. Unlike his game counterpart, he never enters a single Pokémon battle yet does lots of awesome stuff and saves both Pokémon and people left and right. Of course, being able to understand Pokémon speech helps a lot.

He refuses to ever raise his hands against anybody and takes the aforementioned beating to protect Chad from two guys coming for revenge for Chad beating up their little brothers.
</li><li> Daisuke/Duke Fleed from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em>. Normally Daisuke avoids the fight if there not is a good reason. In an episode Goro, a child who sees him as a model, gets angry with him because he refuses to fight with Banta, but Daisuke makes him understand that fighting is not always the right choice.
</li><li> Henry of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> is this trope and like many things in his series, is a Deconstruction. He focuses so thoroughly on the Pacifist part (due to a traumatic incident where he misused his martial arts skill and injured another child badly) that he endangers himself and others. His character arc is learning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">there are times when you have to fight for the greater good.</a>
<ul><li> Henry is also something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">Martial Pacifist</a> or at least that's what he becomes. Before the story, he was an avid computer gamer and one of his faves was a Digimon fighting game, where he chose Terriermon. However, one of these battles went wrong and Henry became overwhelmed with guilt for making Terriermon fight in the first place. This outburst of compassion led to him getting his Digivice and Terriermon entered the real world and becoming his partner. This incident is why he is initially adamant about not letting Terriermon fight. Fittingly, he is also a martial arts student.

And being so good and noble, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Lelouch</a> can't bring himself to kill her, and her path to giving the Japanese their rights utterly derails his ambition to take power through bloody revolution. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sadly, it wasn't meant to be.</span>
</li><li> Thorfinn achieves his greatest moral victory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga">Vinland Saga</a></em> this way. In order to stop a war, he asks to see the king of one of the sides. One of the king's bodyguards tries to chase him off by punching him, only to discover that Thorfinn won't be persuaded no matter how many blows he lands. Thorfinn then makes a bet that if he can tank one hundred blows to the face, he'll be allowed to speak to the king — and pulls it off, completely exhausting the bodyguard in the process who at the end can barely lift his arms. When asked why he simply didn't punch out the bodyguard to prove his credentials, Thorfinn points out that negotiating for peace by punching someone is a self-contradiction. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He then proceeds to successfully solve the conflict nonviolently by telling the king that if he's going to keep pursuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany">The Needs of the Many</a>, Thorfinn is going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartMyOwn">build his own kingdom where the Few can flee to</a>. Canute is so amused he backs down.</span>
</li><li> Queen Otohime in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> is a much-beloved monarch, who despite her poor health, can convince criminals to turn their life around. Her crowning moment of achievement is when she managed to gain the Celestial Dragons' support for the motion for Fishmen to live in the surface. Let that sink in a moment. She managed to convince the most despicable, cruel, yet <em>immensely</em> influential tyrants of the setting to help her. Even better, when said tyrant returns later in the series he saves Shirahoshi (Otohime's daughter) from another Celestial Dragon and reveals that he's changed his attitude completely. She didn't just convince him to help her, she made him completely reform.
</li><li> Prince Halkenburg in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> abhors violence of any sort. He discovers he's been forced into a succession battle for the throne with a Last Man Standing format, and this disgusts him to no end. To that extent, he uses his charisma and genuine concern for the well-being of his subordinates to talk his way into and out of positions to gain political upper hands and survive dangerous situations unscathed. However, when he tries his negotiation skills against his father, the reigning king, and fails completely, he awakens a superpower inside of him—true to his nature, despite it being incredibly overpowered as far as powers go, it deals absolutely no damage at all.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0bab4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0bab4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0bab4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Said power consists of an arrow made of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingSpirit">life aura</a>, which can penetrate any defense, but at the sacrifice of one person who has sworn total dedication to him. The arrow does no damage but instead carries the soul of that dedicated person, and that person then inhabits the body of the target. Should lethal harm come to the target, the soul will return to its original body, provided the body is still alive.</span> Usage of said power causes rumbling in the surrounding area, which puts everybody nearby on high alert, as this rumbling is typically the sign of a person with tremendous power—and indeed, this much is true of Halkenburg.

When there was a switch of author and the new author let Bamse fight an octopus, there was an audience outrage so great that the authors had to issue a public apology. Bamse <em>will</em>, however, happily toss villains up trees to keep them out of the way... even pine trees. Ow.

</li><li> Doctor Leslie Thompkins is a close friend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bruce Wayne</a>, and she is never afraid to stand up to him and give a verbal beatdown about the life of violence he has chosen. She chooses to work in the worst, most crime-ridden areas of Gotham despite offers of more prestigious and high-paying positions because she believes that is where she is most needed. Doctor Thompkins is fully aware of what a cruel world it is out there, and that only makes her feel it is all the more important to not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a>.

With a ruined Gotham officially severed from the rest of the country, she stays behind to run a free clinic for anyone who needs it. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> serial killer Victor Zsasz is brought there unconscious and critically injured, she doesn't hesitate for a moment to save his life, knowing full well that he is likely to kill again, and quite possibly make Thompkins herself his next victim. Soon, Killer Croc arrives to finish Zsasz off, and Thompkins manages to get him to leave peacefully, telling him that he'll have to go through her to get to Zsasz. And once he wakes up, predictably he has his mind set on killing people at the clinic, and she again manages to talk him out of it.

</li></ul></li><li> Marvel's Wundarr the Aquarian. Initially, he was a child-like Superman expy/parody (he was rocketed to Earth by parents who mistakenly believed their planet was about to explode, for instance). However, after exposure to the Cosmic Cube, his power was altered to allow him to absorb and nullify any amount of energy, in proportion to how extreme it is. For example, people can walk or shake hands inside his sphere of influence, but a punch would be slowed to a light tap, a bullet would drop from the air, and even a nuclear explosion would be rendered into a mild illumination (and a bomb inside the field would fail to explode). He is also able to share the cosmic point of view the Cube gave him by touch, which tends to negate hostile intent. Badass Pacifism is basically his entire superpower.

Foggy happens to be at the hospital with Claire, trying to look for Matt, when one skirmish breaks out. Foggy is left stuck in the middle, and seeing how neither of the armed security guards present are in a position to do something, he speaks up.
<div class="indent"><strong>Foggy Nelson:</strong> Hey, asshole! How many priors you got? <br/><strong>Gangbanger 1:</strong> <em>[bewildered]</em> What'd you say to me? <br/><strong>Foggy Nelson:</strong> I asked you about your priors. <br/><strong>Gangbanger 2:</strong> Yeah, keep talking shit, I'll check you into ICU myself. <br/><strong>Foggy Nelson:</strong> You got face tattoos, friend. That's like telegraphing, "I know what prison meatloaf tastes like." <br/><strong>Gangbanger 2:</strong> You just better step back, now. <br/><strong>Foggy Nelson:</strong> I'm not gonna ask if you know what happens when you get charged with assault. I got a hunch you got more mugshots than baby pictures back home. <br/><strong>Gangbanger 2:</strong> Man, who are you? <br/><strong>Foggy Nelson:</strong> I'm the pro-bono suit you'll try to retain after you go down for this. Only not even my soft-hearted partner will take your case, or any other self-respecting attorney in Hell's Kitchen. Not because you're so badass, but because you're just. That. Stupid. <br/><strong>Gangbanger 2:</strong> You got a big mouth, asshole. <br/><strong>Foggy Nelson:</strong> You forget, I do this for a living. I could ask you to look at the faces of the other patients. Every last one of 'em scared to death, because the two of you can't keep it in your pants. But I'm guessing that neither one of you could give a collective shit. So I'm gonna do what attorneys do best and appeal to your selfish natures. Simply put, if you carve each other up now, in front of these witnesses, with cops right outside, you're screwed! <br/><strong>Gangbanger 2:</strong> I can't just walk away, man. <br/><strong>Foggy Nelson:</strong> I'm not asking you to lose the oh-so-serious stink-eye.

<ul><li> It must be stressed that the Doctor is not a <em>pure</em> pacifist, a mistake some of his enemies have made on occasion: he merely dislikes resorting to violence, and is such a genius that he can usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">think of some way to defeat the enemy non-violently</a>. He also frequently sabotages the weapons of evil aliens so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">they blow up in their faces when fired</a>; e.g., "reversing the polarity" on an alien mothership's doomsday weapon so it blows up the mothership itself. Even in these circumstances, the Doctor will try to urge the invading aliens not to attack, and if they do and get destroyed, it could be argued that it made karmic sense for them to be destroyed by their own doomsday weapon. Still, there have been even rarer occasions when the Doctor actually shoots and kills an enemy, plain and simple, when he felt he had no other choice.

As they prepare to fight to the death, Surak insists to Kirk that they must attempt to make peace with the "Evil" representatives. Kirk is ready to give the same speech he's given in half a dozen other episodes to native aliens of several planets about the imperative to rise up and bravely fight off evil — but for once, the "alien" points out to Kirk that just because they <em>disagree</em> about how to handle violence doesn't mean that Kirk's way is automatically morally superior. Surak (politely but firmly) informs Kirk that he is <em>fully aware</em> that if he heads to the "Evil" camp offering peace, they will almost certainly kill him. However, as a man of peace, Surak refuses to abandon his principles of non-violent pacifism, believing that this isn't a test of their ability to survive, but of their values and belief in peace. Surak leaves for the "Evil" camp, alone and unarmed. Even Kirk is moved to remark to Spock that "your Surak is a brave man", to which Spock replies "Men of peace usually are, Captain". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Surak is indeed later killed by the "Evil" characters after offering them peace: the audience is left to decide on their own if Surak's actions were better than Kirk's.</span>

The Romulan commander is proud that they have created a place where Romulans and Klingons can live in peace, but Worf sees that it has come at the price of the young Klingons being ignorant of their culture and their heritage. Without committing or encouraging a single act of violence, Worf teaches the young Klingons about their heritage. Even as the Romulan commander threatens to execute Worf, he doesn't fight back because he wants the Klingons to see how threatened the commander is by Worf, despite his non-violence, so that they will see that their home is really a prison.

His activism is considered a major factor in winning India's independence. Gandhi repeatedly insisted that pacifism is a braver action than violence, and even admitted that he found violence preferable to cowardice. The full quote is, "It is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence." Nonviolence must be pursued with zeal, courage, and conviction; you must be willing to accept death, injury or imprisonment. If you think fighting is a good idea but you're simply unwilling to risk your life yourself, then you have no place in a nonviolent movement.

Note that medics <em>are</em> allowed to act in self-defence or in the defense of their patient(s). The penalty for a medic who engages in offensive action is that the medic's protected status is considered void. Likewise, medical vehicles and personnel have to be clearly identifiable and must conform to many other rules. Against nations or organizations which do not obey the laws of land warfare, this punishment is rather lacking in teeth.

The naval officer took a wooden sword and attempted to strike O-Sensei repeatedly, but O-Sensei <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyDefenseNeedNotProtectMeForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyDefenseNeedNotProtectMeForever">simply dodged his attacks until the officer collapsed from exhaustion</a>.
</li><li> Paul Rusesabagina, whose story was chronicled in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotelRwanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotelRwanda">Hotel Rwanda</a></em>. During the massacres in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Rwanda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Rwanda">Rwanda</a> in 1994, he managed to save over a thousand people who had been marked for death by sheltering them in his hotel and transporting them to safety, and standing up to corrupt military officials and screaming, machete-wielding mobs, all without raising a single firearm.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, many members of the Religious Society of Friends, more commonly known as the Quakers, attempted to reconcile their church's strict pacifism with their desire to see the fall of fascism. To this end, they often volunteered to serve as medics, going unarmed onto battlefields to save lives, rather than end them. Dangerous enough in a normal conflict, but in the Pacific Theatre and South-East Asian Theatres, where the Japanese had a habit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">targeting non-combat personnel such as medics</a>, this was borderline suicidal. But they did it anyway. Because they were Badass.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a></em>, raised as a Quaker, joined the U. S. Naval Reserve after four months at a dead-end job of replying to correspondence with the tire rationing division, was involved in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a></em> in a logistics person in charge of loading and unloading aircraft as well as preparing manifests and flight plans for C-47 operations, and moved up from lieutenant junior grade to a Navy lieutenant, lieutenant commander, and eventually commander, followed by serving as Eisenhower's vice-president, and his eventual election as President in 1968.
</li><li> 36 of them went even further, volunteering to be guinea pigs in experiments on the treatment of extreme starvation. The participants were fed diets of 500 calories per day while maintaining heavy physical labor so that doctors could get a better idea of what was needed to recover. The data from these experiments was critical for concentration camp survivors and other refugees at the end of the war and still informs the treatment of people who have been in conditions of extreme deprivation.

Just to be clear, these were <em>Nazi camp guards</em>, and they didn't have the heart to shoot him.

In other words: John Rabe told the Japanese Army to leave his people alone, and they did. Moreover, he did it without the help of his government at the time - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>, who were allies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">the Japanese</a>. In fact, the Gestapo actually censored his letters and upon his return, arrested him. Were it not for the intervention of Siemens AG (yes, the company), he probably would have been executed. His association (despite never really being a part of it) with the Nazi party would go on to plague the remainder of his life. But his deeds in Nanjing resulted in the people of the city sending monthly care packages to his family so they wouldn't starve and he was called 'The Living Buddha of Nanjing'.
</li><li> Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mexico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mexico">Mexico</a>.

</div></li></ul></li><li> Elizabeth Fry, a Quaker who worked toward prison reforms in England. Early on, she heard about the terrible conditions in women's prisons for women and their children (who at that point in history usually stayed with their mothers in prison) and went there with stacks of blankets and clothes. The guard tried to stop her from going in, saying that he would not even risk his own life in there with the rowdy prisoners. The story goes (for nobody wrote it down while it was happening, so "the story goes" is as best as we can do) that Elizabeth looked the guard straight in the eye and said "I am going in - and alone. I thank you for your kind intentions, but you are not to come with me." That, my friend, takes guts.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt">Egyptian</a> protesters in Tahrir Square. They faced assault by riot police and gangs of thugs armed with machetes, molotovs, and even firearms. They responded by erecting barriers, establishing their own community-organized security to keep out government infiltrators who would initiate violence, and repeatedly calling for nonviolence. There were a few situations where they would strike back at isolated attackers or throw rocks to keep their oppressors from getting too close, but for the most part, they maintained their dedication to peaceful protest. And in doing so, they overthrew Hosni Mubarak, who led one of the most firmly entrenched military dictatorships in the world.
</li><li> The citizens of the Baltic states during the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_Revolution">Singing Revolution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who, during the peak of their uprising against Communist rule, formed a huge human chain, 600 km (373 mi) long through the capital city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Estonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Estonia">Estonia</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Latvia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Latvia">Latvia</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Lithuania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Lithuania">Lithuania</a>. When the Soviet military cracked down on them, they linked arms and sang in the face of tanks and armour-piercing bullets that cut them down. Yes, they brought down their oppressive dictatorship <em>through singing</em>.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnation_Revolution">Carnation revolution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that toppled the military dictatorship of Portugal. Okay, it was a Military coup, but it succeeded because it had massive public support, and because the military forces loyal to the government flat out refused not only to fire on civilians but refused to fire on their former comrades in arms in the revolutionary faction (The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">GNR Republican guard</a> had no such qualms and killed 8 civilians). The revolution is so named because when troops marched into crowds with orders to disperse them, the crowed put carnations in the troops gun barrels, and the soldiers let them. The revolution is probably best summed up by these extract from the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Carnation_Revolution">timeline on Wikipedia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

One time a local tough guy tried to bully Norris into giving him his seat at a bar and Norris quietly complied. Later, tough guy realized who he was talking to and asked Norris why he didn't kick his ass. Norris replied "What would it prove?"
</li><li> The American Plains Indians (Lakota, Sioux, etc) had a practice called counting coup in which warriors would go unarmed into a battle and touch an enemy warrior with a coup stick. Although they were not pacifists all the time, they did this purely to be badass, thinking it more honorable than violence.
</li><li> Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dr. Hawa Abdi has been running a hospital in Somalia for 29 years. During this time, the hospital has been attacked numerous times, and was once even invaded outright by a militia group who barricaded her in her office and held patients captive. They eventually wound up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PityTheKidnapper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PityTheKidnapper">begging</a></em> her to reopen the place, and she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">refused to do so unless they left her alone completely and issued a written apology</a>. Which she got. She also once walked out alone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamingTheMob">confront</a> (another) rebel militia group that was blocking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRedCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRedCross">Red Cross</a> supply truck, and came back not just with the supplies, but with the militia acting as an honor guard.
</li><li> Chinese philosopher Mozi preached the pacifistic school of Mohism which competed with Confucianism and Daoism in its day. He once wrote how during the Warring States period he walked from warring state of Song to Chu in ten days. Once there he participated in nine war games with the chief strategist and defeated the strategist every time. When the strategist threatened him with death, he informed them that his disciples had already trained the soldiers of Song so it would be pointless to kill him. The state of Chu ended up calling off the war.
</li><li> Similarly, disciples of Mohism were sought after because of their brilliance in military strategy and siege engineering. Why? Because their pacifist philosophy meant that they believed in using defensive warfare to protect smaller states from aggressive warfare.

</li><li> After the murder of a British soldier in Woolwich, England in May 2013, a whole series of attempted far-right demonstrations (for those where any people actually bothered to turn up) sprung up around the country and tried targeting mosques. What did a mosque in York do when it found itself victim to one of these demonstrations? It invited in the EDL and BNP members who had marched on it in for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotOfTea">tea and biscuits</a>, plus a friendly game of football (soccer to you yanks).

</li><li> Daniel O'Connell, aka "The Liberator", aka "The Emancipator" was an Irish politician who campaigned for equal rights for Catholics in Ireland and for Irish Independence in the 19th century. Though he killed a man in a duel when he insulted Dublin Corporation, this haunted him for the rest of his days and he tried to compensate the widow. Gandhi and Martin Luther King directed cited him as an inspiration.
</li><li> When the government started cracking down on protestors in Turkey in 2013, a performance artist known as "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2013/06/19/turkey-protests-standing-man.html">Standing Man<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" (or in Turkish, <em>Duran Adam</em>) <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5iegz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5iegz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5iegz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">real name Erdem Gündüz</span> responded by simply walking into Taksim Square, putting his hands in his pockets, and silently standing motionless. Gradually onlookers started to join him, eventually sparking a series of similar demonstrations. Turkish officials remarked, "This is not an act of violence. We cannot condemn it."

As most fit young men were gone off to war the forest service was very glad to have them. Some British conscientious objectors volunteered as Bevin boys to work in coal mines for similar reasons. Other British conscientious objectors worked as firefighters during the Blitz or as sappers defusing unexploded German bombs.
</li><li> In 2013, a gunman broke into a school in Decatur, Georgia with an AK-47 type weapon, intending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">to open fire on children</a> and first responders. However, front office worker <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/21/us/georgia-school-gunshots/index.html">Antoinette Tuff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> stood her ground and... <em>talked</em> with him, telling him about her own struggles, sympathizing with his anger, and eventually persuading him to put down his gun and give himself up to the police. What could have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">a massacre on the scale of Sandy Hook</a> was averted merely with kind words.

She said in an interview about the Taliban still coming after her, if they did, while her first instinct would be to take her shoes off to hit the assassin, she realized this would make her just like him, so she would sit there and ask for a chance to explain her choices and beliefs. Once she said her piece and if he didn't wish to speak in response, she would not fight him if he still wanted to shoot her. The result of this? She's become one of the biggest figureheads for advancement of women's rights and education, and even became the youngest recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">St. John Paul II</a> also deserves a spot. Without resorting to violence, he opposed both the Nazi occupation of Poland (even being ordained during a time when the Nazis were executing priests and seminarians, and he also helped to hide Jews to keep them from being sent off to concentration camps) and the Communist puppet government installed by the Soviet Union. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MikhailGorbachev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MikhailGorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> has said that he helped break down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IronCurtain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IronCurtain">Iron Curtain</a>. Perhaps also his greatest moment of mercy came after an assassination attempt; after recovering, he visited his would-be assassin in prison and personally forgave him.

What's the best thing about the video? In spite of the constant verbal abuse and physical assault, <em>none of the abused so much as raise a fist</em>. The most they do is block a punch or move her arm out the way, and get some damn good snark in. As some of the commentators put it:
<div class="indent"> <em>Well done to the gentleman for keeping his calm, even though he may speak a different language or possibly have non-national heritage, he is a much better representative of England than she ever could possibly be!</em>

The pastor went over to meet him, gave him a hug and some kind words, took away the gun, offered to pray for him, and invited him to stay for the service. The gunman ended up making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn">HeelFaith Turn</a>.
</li><li> In June 2017, a man deliberately crashed his van into a crowd of people outside a mosque in Finsbury Park, London, killing one and injuring ten. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/imam-hailed-as-hero-for-calming-crowd-and-defending-attacker/news-story/46343335fba56ca4f5a6ba5ab7bd04f8">Local imam Mohammed Mahmoud stepped in to protect the driver from an angry mob<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, with some others coming to help him, while the driver was laughing and shouting "I want to kill all Muslims!" The imam and his helpers managed to flag down a passing police car and helped the driver into the back of the car, while warning the police that an angry mob was trying to get to him.
</li><li> Despite knowing that being caught would almost certainly be a death sentence, the White Rose movement decided to defy the Nazis authorities by publishing leaflets of text that called the Nazis out for their lies and barbarity as well as criticise the indifference of the German people to the suffering of their victims. The White Rose would make the ultimate sacrifice to protect the truth with the only blood spilt being their own.
