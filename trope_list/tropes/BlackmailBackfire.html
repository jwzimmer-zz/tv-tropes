It can happen in a few ways.
</p><p></p><ol><li> The blackmailer doesn't have much (if any) leverage.
<ol><li> The victim has no problem with the information being made public — he doesn't really care very much, feels that there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">No Such Thing as Bad Publicity</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreatBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreatBackfire">even considers the "blackmail material" something worth boasting about.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserOfTwoEvils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesserOfTwoEvils">The victim decides that the blackmailer's terms are worse than having the information publicized</a>, and may even reveal the information themselves.
</li><li> The information isn't as secret as the blackmailer originally presumed it to be. The blackmailee's wife/girlfriend/other-individual-of-importance is already well aware.
</li><li> Whatever the blackmailer held over the blackmailee ceases to have any importance.
</li><li> The blackmailee makes it clear that if the blackmailer tries to push him around, he will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">destroy the blackmailer even if that means his own ruin.</a>
</li><li> The blackmailer is blackmailing the wrong person (because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity">Mistaken Identity</a> or some other issue). The blackmailee really couldn't give a damn.
</li><li> Turns out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">Everyone Has Standards</a>: the blackmailer has enough lack of scruples to look for dirt and then <em>threaten</em> someone with blackmail, but doesn't has the guts (or lack of heart, in more heartwarming/humanizing examples) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">to actually follow through and ruin someone's life</a>.
</li></ol></li><li> The blackmailee is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">the blackmailer has bitten off more than he or she can chew.</a>
</li><li> The scheme doesn't just go wrong for the blackmailer; it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">goes horribly wrong</a>, and the blackmailer is <em>screwed</em>.
<ol><li> The blackmailer made the unwise choice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster">blackmailing someone who has no qualms about murder</a> (or in the best-case scenarios, either unleashes all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">his power and influence</a> and destroys the blackmailer socially and/or financially before he can do any damage or is so violent that a significant amount of the blackmailer's money is probably going to go into paying the eventual hospital stay).
</li><li> The victim has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">been</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">so</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">ruined</a> by their life experience that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">he or she has nothing left to lose</a> and only wants one thing: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> (or at least to stop the blackmailer in his/her tracks).
</li><li> The blackmailee asks "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouToldAnyoneElse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouToldAnyoneElse">Have You Told Anyone Else?</a>" and the blackmailer hasn't, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderIsTheBestSolution">Murder Is the Best Solution</a>.
</li><li> The victim is already being blackmailed (or protected) by a different criminal, and in the ensuing war of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollidingCriminalConspiracies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollidingCriminalConspiracies">Colliding Criminal Conspiracies</a>, the blackmailer is the one with insufficient firepower.
</li><li> The victim obtains blackmail-worthy information on <em>the blackmailer</em> (which, for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>, will probably be even worse than what the blackmailer has on him) and either makes clear that if the blackmail continues <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyAssuredDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyAssuredDestruction">Mutually Assured Destruction</a> will ensue or will use it to force the blackmailer to suffer an equal or worse indignity.
</li><li> The blackmailer is blackmailing someone over a murder they <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">know</a></em> that person has committed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">not stopping to consider that if a target has already killed his/her way out of a previous dilemma, they're unlikely to have any problem with doing it again</a>.

The discussion between Kal-El and a still somewhat-unapologetic Lois is that Lois thinks the removal of the threat was a good idea, but Superman insists that the threat was his (and <em>only</em> his) to bear, and Lois seemed to him a bit <em>too</em> eager to try to cut the knot.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBusinessOfDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBusinessOfDying">The Business Of Dying</a></em> has two instances of blackmail backfiring on Miriam Fox. Blackmail A backfired, because the person she was blackmailing said they didn't care if she revealed her information, because it would be 'the word of some junkie prostitute' against a rather respectable person. Blackmail B ended up getting her killed.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> story "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton", the title character is a blackmailer. Sherlock and Watson are determined to destroy papers that he has that he intends to publish to ruin various powerful men of society. While they're burglarizing his house, a woman shows up ostensibly visiting him to give him more dirt on someone. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She isn't  she is a woman whose life Charles has ruined and she's there to kill him so he can't ruin any more lives.</span>
</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkHalf">The Dark Half</a></em>, the protagonist Thad Beaumont is a not well-known writer, who published several thrillers while using the pen-name of George Stark (said thrillers being a lot more successful than his mainstream work). A man named Fred Clawson discovers the link between Beaumont and Stark, then tries to blackmail Beaumont, threatening to reveal to the media that Beaumont and Stark are the same person. Beaumont was already pondering to stop writing as Stark, and this threat is the final push he needs to do so. He reveals his second identity to the media himself, staging some mock funerals to symbolise Stark's death, and thus prevents Clawson from gaining anything. This was actually a series of events which happened before the novel's beginning. In the proper novel, a being with Stark's mind comes to life and starts a murderous trip to reach Beaumont with the intent of becoming fully human. One of his first victims is the unsuccessful blackmailer, as a revenge because the blackmail attempt was partly responsible for Stark's "death".
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DirkPittAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DirkPittAdventures">Dirk Pitt</a> novel <em>Vixen 03</em>, Pitt and lover Congresswoman Loren Smith are secretly photographed during a tryst. Fellow Congressman Daggat tries to use the photos to force Loren to back one of his plans, saying the photos will ruin her and Pitt's Senator father. However, Pitt interrupts a meeting to note that Daggat has no leverage as Pitt's father is considering retiring soon anyway. He then says he's already gotten Daggat's accomplice to spill the beans. As Pitt states, which is a bigger scandal: Two unmarried adults carrying on a relationship or a Congressman blackmailing a colleague to get his own way? Realizing Pitt is right, Daggat is forced to back down.
<div class="indent"><strong>Pitt:</strong> Congressman Daggat is about to retire from the blackmail game. He doesn't have the talent for it. He wouldn't last ten minutes against a tried and true professional. <br/><strong>Daggat:</strong> Like yourself? <br/><strong>Pitt:</strong> No, like my father.
</div></li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DifferentSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DifferentSeasons">Apt Pupil</a></em> involves Todd Bowden discovering that his neighbor Kurt Dussander is an escaped Nazi and the former commander of a concentration camp. Todd is morbidly obsessed with the Holocaust, and he forces Dussander to tell him about the concentration camp by threatening to expose his past. Dussander complies for a few months, but eventually decides he's had enough. He points out that, by not exposing him sooner, Todd is now complicit in hiding Dussander from the authorities — Todd can't expose Dussander without exposing himself to punishment as well. To further twist the knife, Dussander claims that he left a complete account of Todd's actions in a bank deposit box, to be opened and read if Dussander dies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's lying about the safe deposit box. But the psychological strain of being counter-blackmailed is one of several factors that leads to Todd completely snapping at the end of the story.</span>

</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>'s unspoken rules is that any person who stoops to blackmail will be dead by the end of the story. It's not always because threatening murderers with exposure tends to lead to getting murdered, but this is very common.
</li><li> This trope also frequently pops up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe">Nero Wolfe</a> mysteries:
<ul><li> <em>Fer-de-lance</em>, the first novel in the series, starts the pattern with the reveal that Carlo Maffei, the missing man whose disappearance caused Wolfe and Archie Goodwin to get involved in the case, unwittingly designed a tool that was used as a murder weapon and, on realising this, thought that blackmailing the person who hired him was a good idea. Naturally, he was very much mistaken.
</li><li> An interesting variant pops up in <em>And Be A Villain</em>, in which it's revealed a blackmail syndicate has been targeting people with slander in order to pressure them into paying up to get it to stop. The variant is that the blackmailers in this case actually made up <em>false</em> stories about their victims that would nevertheless do serious damage to their reputations if it got out, but they ended up approaching someone with what they thought was a lie about them committing murder only to realise too late that they'd accidentally stumbled onto the truth. It ends about the same way you'd expect this trope to end for a blackmailer in a murder mystery.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em>, a craftsman making a copy of Lord Vetinari's signet ring for the Lord-V-obsessed Cosmo Lavish bumps up his price considerably to "forget" he made it (the ring is made of a highly illegal material only available to licensed Assassins), and then a bit more because Cosmo's secretary agreed to the first price increase too quickly. The secretary reluctantly lets Cosmo's personal assassin deal with the problem.
<ul><li> Later on, Cosmo and his newfound criminal friend Cribbins stake their plans on the belief Moist will go along with their planned blackmail. The entire thing collapses when Moist instead confesses to a lifetime of con artistry in public court, derailing his trial until new evidence appears against Cosmo.

In most cases the motive is money, but once or twice the blackmailer is a lonely woman who is in love with the killer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove">and wants to force them into marriage</a>  in one such case, the killer is <em>relieved</em> to be caught just to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">avoid this fate</a>. Nine times out of ten, the killer either murders the blackmailer, or the blackmailer becomes the murderer after their victim threatens to expose them. The second pilot is perhaps the only time the killer actually agrees to pay the blackmailer off, and even <em>that</em> doesn't work because the "blackmailer" in question was working with Columbo the whole time.

When they find it, Veronica is confused to read the file's notes on smoking causing cancer and the dangers of various building materials. It turns out the CEO hasn't updated the folder since he hid it and thus all the "secrets" are things that have been public knowledge for years.

He uses this ability to blackmail three of these people into paying him to keep quiet, but neglects to properly research his victims first to learn what exactly it is they did, and more importantly if they are likely to retaliate or not. Sure enough, his third victim, Sallinger, has Erik and Jessica attacked, severly injuring the latter and thus kicking off the plot.

</li><li> The 1989 mini-series <em>Twist of Fate</em> has SS Colonel Helmut von Schreader hunted for his part in a failed plot against Hitler. He hatches a desperate plan to get plastic surgery and then pose a Jewish prisoner named Ben Grossman. He ends up in the wrong camp and, upon being freed, circumstances soon lead him to become a major fighter for Israeli independence and marrying a Jewish woman. 25 years later, he's a well-regarded colonel in the Israeli army when two former SS buddies come to him and demand he supply them with some uranium or they'll expose his identity. Smirking, Grossman asks which of these two <em>wanted Nazi war criminals</em> is going to be the one to testify in an <em>Israeli</em> court (without any actual evidence) that a concentration camp survivor turned war hero was once an SS officer. Realizing Grossman is right, the Nazis go to the back-up plan of threatening Grossman's wife and son. He seems cowed but really goes to his long-time friend who's a high-ranking Mossad agent. Grossman sells the story that he was on vacation when they found him, claiming to recognize the two while in the concentration camp and they're threatening his family to force him along. His friend buys it and soon comes up with a scheme of Grossman pretending to pass the uranium as a sting.

<ul><li> The KGB had several women pose as flight stewardesses and seduce Indonesian president Sukarno. The orgy was secretly filmed and the KGB showed it to Sukarno with the intention of blackmailing him. Instead, Sukarno thanked the KGB for a lovely night and asked for a copy of the tape  he wanted to release it to Indonesian theatres so his subjects would see how virile their president was.
<ul><li> Allegedly, in an attempt to leverage him, the CIA tried to do the same with similar results.

<ul><li> Apparently, something similar was considered by the CIA: to discredit a Middle Eastern leader, they were going to leak fake pictures of the man having sex with other men. It wouldn't have worked; apparently, in this man's country, such acts were considered a minor transgression, like a French president's mistress.

Indeed, a good rule of thumb is to presume that a person's proclivities are known to their superiors.
</li><li> The author of the book "Silk", about the KGB blackmailing Westerners, revealed that the CIA tried something similar, which didn't work because Eastern Europeans didn't care; being seduced by foreigners was considered one of the perks of the job.

</li><li> When the famous London courtesan Harriette Wilson was about to publish a tell-all memoir, one of the famous names involved was the Duke of Wellington, a national hero known for his defeat of Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo. The publisher contacted Wellington, letting him know that unless Wellington paid up, Wilson's stories about Wellington would be included. Wellington's response was simply "Publish and be damned!" His reputation not only survived, he became Prime Minister; Wilson and her publisher had a brief windfall from the memoirs, but the publisher was soon devastated by libel suits and Wilson fell on hard times and died in obscurity.

They offered to bury the story in return for retracting claims he'd made against their parent company. The problem was that Bezos was already planning to end his marriage and marry his mistress, and wasn't particularly concerned with being publicly exposed. He publicly admitted everything in a blog post, including publishing the blackmail messages, which exposed them to possible criminal charges. It didn't really cost him anything that he wasn't planning to give up anyway.

As soon as he saw the information, Letterman said that he contacted the Manhattan District Attorney's office and partook in a sting operation.
