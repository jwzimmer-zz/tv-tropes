He provides no plot impetus in and of himself, and has essentially spent the entire story thus far in a reactive state. Whatever is going on in the world, be it war or intrigue, it just drags him along in its wake.
</p><p>This is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Designated Hero</a>. Designated Heroes actually <em>do</em> things. The things they do may not be considered heroic, but they still do things and thus have an impact on the world around them. Eventually they pick up the Plot Ball and move it around. Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleHeroBigWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleHeroBigWar">Little Hero in a Big War</a> still has the hero do something important to affect the larger mess around him. The Pinball Protagonist spends a decent amount of time failing to actually have <em>any</em> effect at all. They aren't even lucky enough to <em>be</em> the Plot Ball. If the writing and tone of the tale all imply that the character is the protagonist, and yet they can be lifted right out of the story and have little to no impact on anything that has or will happen: then they're just a little silver ball in the cosmic pinball game of life.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Why in the hell is this character the protagonist, the reader might be wondering? Perhaps the protagonist is like a vehicle or a touchstone for the reader, a way of exploring some strange new world or meeting interesting characters. However, many characters will have pinball episodes where they are simply overloaded with too many problems in far too short of a time frame to be able to do anything effective. This does not make them a Pinball Protagonist.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonPeripheralNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonPeripheralNarrator">First-Person Peripheral Narrator</a>. Also compare the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIngenue">The Ingenue</a> archetypal character, defined by the ability to bear up under hardship (an undervalued heroic quality often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized">Flanderized</a> into a passive characterization). This can be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact">Villains Act, Heroes React</a> taken to an extreme. Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessProtagonist">Useless Protagonist</a>, where the main characters make <em>no</em> attempt to make themselves seem important, although these tropes may overlap over time. Contrast with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungConqueror">Young Conqueror</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroProtagonist">Hero Protagonist</a>, who actually drives the plot and makes the villains react to them.

</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BouncingBattler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BouncingBattler">Bouncing Battler</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeTheBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeTheBall">Be the Ball</a>, where the protagonist fights by acting like a literal pinball.
</p><p><strong>Before adding an example:</strong> It is too easy to label a hero as a Pinball Protagonist when that is not the intent. The character must be completely (or nearly completely) superfluous <strong>all the time</strong>. Having an episode or two where s/he accomplishes nothing does not make an example. As mentioned above, a character is a Pinball protagonist <strong>if and only if</strong> the character can be completely removed from the entire story, with little to no impact on the actual events or characters.
</p><p>Also remember that not having agency (i.e. only does things because somebody else told him to) does not mean it's this trait. Even if he did things on other people's instructions, if the hero's actions impact the story, than he's not a Pinball Protagonist. Similarly, if the hero's actions have different outcomes than he wanted them to have, even making the situation worse, that's not this trope. That is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>.
</p><p>Finally, keep in mind that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, and the title of Pinball Protagonist should not be automatically viewed as a bad thing. As mentioned above, it can be a deliberate tool to help explore a world or society, where the character is merely an observation point, or it can be that the character grows through his experiences.

<ul><li> Ichigo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is like this in a way. He does have an impact on the story but only due to reacting to his newfound duty as shinigami or rescuing his friends from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Since he is not under the <em>direct</em> influence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Yamamoto</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Aizen</a>, he never really confronts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> directly until said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> threatens to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">annihilate his hometown</a>.
</li><li> Renton of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em> actually spends a great deal of the series completely in the dark and out of control of the events that transpires around him. He doesn't even come face to face with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series despite being the protagonist.
</li><li> Brandon Heat all throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gungrave">Gungrave</a></em> is a quiet and obedient henchman. He initiates nothing, suspects nothing, and says almost nothing. Even his undead rampage is less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">roaring</a> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">sedate</a>.
</li><li> Kyon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> spends a lot of time mostly just watching things happen and doing whatever people tell him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">That isn't to say that he's boring or without personality, however,</a> and his apathy is a source of frustration to other characters, which is amusing.
</li><li> Shiro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em> seems to be this initially, but is eventually subverted later as he starts actively searching for the answers to the mystery surrounding his situation, and then even more when it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">revealed</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's actually the Silver King, and thus, essentially the person single-handedly responsible for setting <em>the entire series</em> in motion.</span>
</li><li> Natsuru in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kampfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kampfer">Kämpfer</a></em> gets dragged around by other people and he just goes along with them in the end anyway. Much worse in the anime than in the manga and light novels, although it's still pretty bad in the latter two. The main difference is, in the latter, s/he at least <em>tries</em> to make a token effort to undermine the Kampfer War and learn the truth behind it, whereas in the anime, s/he just sorta stands there with a confused expression.
</li><li> The protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonoSuba">KonoSuba</a></em> have no interest in fighting the Demon King's forces. They only do so because circumstances force them to.
</li><li> Until the climax of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em>, Kenichi and Tima spend most of their time wandering from one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a> locale to the next, occasionally getting shot at. Tima may also qualify as a walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>.
</li><li> Shu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere">Now and Then, Here and There</a></em> attempts a lot of heroic stuff, but his actions have little to no effect on the series' plot or resolution. Remove him and the same things would have happened.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SteamBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SteamBoy">Steam Boy</a></em> spent the majority of the movie doing whatever grandpa, Scarlet, father or Mr. Stephenson wanted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">To his credit</a>, when circumstances finally did leave him alone for a moment, he quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">came up with a plan of his own</a>, rejected the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardUnderstudy">Bastard Understudy</a>'s advice and became the hero of the day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrangeDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StrangeDawn">Strange Dawn</a></em>: Eri and Yuko don't really do much throughout the story, except for just communicating with the other characters. This is one of the main criticisms the anime received from reviewers.
</li><li> Ichise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze">Texhnolyze</a></em>. There doesn't appear to be much consideration of his actions, reacting like a rabid animal when he's not simply following orders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em>: If Rito had his way, he'd just have a normal, boring life, pining away after the girl he likes. Of course, we wouldn't have the harem comedy we have right now, so the girls keep pulling him into his antics, whether he likes it or not.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KaraNoKyoukai">Kara no Kyoukai</a></em>. Shiki and Mikiya are the central characters of the story, but they do very little to drive its main plot along — mostly because both are dragged into said plot against their will. Within individual chapters, they often do find motivation to get involved, with Mikiya usually drawn to protecting the victims (whom he often knows personally), while Shiki only gets excited when either a really powerful opponent appears for her to fight, or Mikiya is threatened in any way. While both undergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> in the process (Shiki moreso than Mikiya), their story is much more about <em>staying</em> human in the face of an onslaught of supernatural weirdness than about achieving any particular goal.

Frobisher is the viewpoint character and creates plot development by total accident, the Doctor is absent from large chunks of the plot and the one-shot companion Eugene is explicitly unable to intervene in events, being as he is a scribe whose job is to write down everything that happens.

</li><li> There's a comic book where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomOfTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomOfTheOpera">The Phantom of the Opera</a>; it follows the original Leroux book, with Holmes tacked on to watch the show.
</li><li> Spider-Man himself tends to turn into this in any multipart story in his own series that has lots of guest stars. He's always been a guy who works best alone, and quickly takes a back seat as part of a team. The biggest example was the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaximumCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaximumCarnage">Maximum Carnage</a></em> storyline; the cover of one issue even lampshaded the trope by having Spidey shout, "Hey! Whose mag is this, anyway?!" Fortunately, he was indeed the star at the climax, both defeating Carnage himself and preventing Venom from killing him to show he'd still hold onto his principles, despite all that had happened.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a> in his backstory comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThanosRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThanosRising">Thanos Rising</a></em> spends much of each issue acting on suggestions from Death who is constantly nagging to commit murders. Even when he becomes a space pirate captain it's because he accidentally won a duel with the old captain. He swings a sword with his eyes shut and kills him without meaning to, and so gains authority by sheer accident.
</li><li> In several issues of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a>'s first limited series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> actually got more screen time.

<ul><li> Because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disneyfication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disneyfication">Disneyfication</a>, Mowgli in Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJungleBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJungleBook">The Jungle Book</a></em> spends all his time reacting to the other characters and doesn't instigate any plot events; he <em>does</em> resolve the plot in the end, but he needs Baloo's help to do so. This is totally ironic if you know the character from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>'s original stories.
</li><li> The titular unicorn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLastUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLastUnicorn">The Last Unicorn</a></em> leaves her forest to find the rest of her kind...and does practically nothing else for the rest of the story.

The only thing she does of her own volition is run into Phillip; everything else she does is at someone else's order or suggestion. She has a total of eighteen lines of dialogue in the entire movie. Phillip doesn't do a whole lot, either, as even in the final battle, the fairies are clearly doing most of the work.
</li><li> The heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a></em> is also an example of this trope. The dwarfs, the wicked queen, the huntsman and the prince are the characters who actively drive the plot, while Snow White's role is to inspire their actions and have things happen to her as a result of how the others feel about her. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowWhiteAndTheSevenDwarfs">the original Grimms' fairy-tale</a>, the queen is essentially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>, who takes the most action and gets the most attention out of all the characters in the text; while Snow White gets more emphasis in the Disney version, she's still mainly important for what happens to her, not for anything she does herself.

He undergoes no notable character development or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>, which makes his burst of heroism in the movie's final act come across as an unexpected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a>.

She's found by a fairy prince, who takes her on a ride during which she's spotted by a toad who then steals her. The toads then just leave her on a lily pad, and she spends the rest of the movie bumping into various antagonists. The only proactive thing she does is to get Jacquimo to fly her to the Vale of the Fairies for the climax.
</li><li> The narrator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/WaltzWithBashir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/WaltzWithBashir">Waltz with Bashir</a></em> is a decidedly tragic example. When his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldPromotion">commanding officer is killed</a> he doesn't rise to the occasion and completely fails to get any of his squad mates out alive; afterward he bitterly realizes that there was a lot more he could have done but was just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt">confused kid who got in over his head</a>.

Even his initial action, shooting an officer in a duel, turns out to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> have been a fake duel, planned all along by his friends</span>.

This is still an <em>improvement</em> on the original book, in which Charlie does almost <em>nothing</em> upon arriving at the factory. His only act of any significance is at the end, when he informs Mr. Wonka that he is the only child left. Mr. Wonka then immediately announces that Charlie has won <em>by default</em>.

</li><li> Jen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkCrystal">The Dark Crystal</a></em> spends much of the film's first and second acts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">commenting on</a> how he has no idea where he is going or what he is looking for as various characters comment on prophecy and destiny and the like.

His biggest part in the story is to be declared Messiah and become the focus of hope for the Jewish people, but by that point it's clear they're so desperate for a savior that any person would have sufficed and they completely ignore Brian's own attempts to stop or guide them.

Whereas in the previous three movies he had been largely pursuing Will and Elizabeth's agendas, and he still had motivations of his own in the first two, he's supposedly the central figure of these two movies. Yet he's still being dragged along and following someone else's agenda in both cases, and his contribution is largely limited to making jokes or being the butt of them.

The actual climax of the film he is a passive figure as the Ark is opened and all the bad guys are immolated by the wrath of god. Viewing the events of the movie knowing that was going to happen, all of the hero's efforts seem to merely complicate a situation that was going to dispose of the bad guys eventually anyway. The <em>only</em> action he took that was of any significance was making sure Marian didn't gaze upon the Ark as well.

She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">told practically nothing about her mission</a> and Matt and Alejandro do pretty much everything of actual importance to the plot.

After his daughter is killed by a bomb set off by terrorists claiming to be affiliated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists">the IRA</a>, he sets his sights on Irish politician and former IRA member Liam Hennessy simply because of this connection. He subjects Hennessy to a campaign of psychological warfare, setting off nonlethal bombs around his properties and beating up his bodyguards in order to get the names of the bombers out of it. The thing is, Hennessy is already cooperating with the police in order to find the bombers, whose targeting of civilians horrifies him. By the time he knows the names and gives them to Quan, the police have already been informed as well. Quan finds the bombers and kills almost all of them, nearly causing even more deaths because the police (who had already gotten a raid ready to go when Quan showed up) needed to get the location of a final bomb out of the last surviving terrorist before it blew.

Jake Epping, a man from 2011 living incognito in the late 50s and early 60s on a mission to prevent the Kennedy assassination, has to study Lee Harvey Oswald's actions to make sure that he is in fact acting alone, but he must also be extremely careful not to alert Oswald to his presence. In other words, Oswald's actions drive the plot of the book for the most part, and Jake just has to follow him around and actively avoid doing anything important until he's positive that killing Oswald will in fact save Kennedy.

</li><li> Most fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em> would describe Aziraphale and Crowley as the protagonists, but the pair only even get focus in the first third of the novel; they're barely in the middle section and accomplish nothing during the climax. The main plot is all about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAntiChrist">Adam</a> accidentally starting and then preventing the Apocalypse, which Aziraphale and Crowley aren't even around to observe.

</li><li> Many, many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> protagonists. Most of them just stumble into otherworldly places and characters and spend more time trying to survive than actually being heroes or fighting monsters. Often enough the conflict is between different entities and is resolved regardless of the kids.

</li><li> Tyrone Slothrop of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GravitysRainbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GravitysRainbow">Gravitys Rainbow</a></em>, who never solves the mystery he's after, spends his time on various sidequests instead, avoids death only by accident and eventually simply goes mad, gives up and disappears from the story.

If something isn't directly affecting her right then and there, she'll forget about it.

</li></ul><ul><li> Nora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HushHush">Hush, Hush</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Inkheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Inkheart">Inkheart</a></em> by Cornelia Funke (Meggie spends a lot of her time just reacting to things the adults do.

However, various circumstances typically get Kino wrapped up in the affairs of the places she comes to and forces her to act, whether she wants to or not.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MasqueradeCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MasqueradeCycle">Prophecy</a></em> is largely told through the perspective of an enslaved soldier who has next to no impact on the plot of the book.

Naturally, this makes the two times she stands up for herself all the more impressive and the other characters all the more shocked.
</li><li> Both the book <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheManuscriptFoundInSaragossa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheManuscriptFoundInSaragossa">The Manuscript Found In Saragossa</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSaragossaManuscript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSaragossaManuscript">the movie adaptation</a>: Alphonse van Worden has various bewildering or scary things happen around him and to him, and is told lots of stories. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Most of it turns out to be a show staged for van Worden in an attempt to convince or convert him.</span>

He doesn't influence the trial in any way, or have anything to do with the murder — he could just as easily have been left out, and the story written in third person, and while the feel of the story would be different, the plot wouldn't change at all.
</li><li> Terisa Morgan of Stephen R. Donaldson's <em>Mordant's Need</em> novels (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMirrorOfHerDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMirrorOfHerDreams">The Mirror of Her Dreams</a>, A Man Rides Through) acts this way through most of both books. (This is deliberate. She has a cripplingly low level of self-confidence thanks to an oppressive father and passive mother; the narration makes an analogy to a princess imprisoned by a curse.)
</li><li> Cosette in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LesMiserables">Les Misérables</a></em>. She mostly exists as a catalyst to inspire other characters to do other things. Her existence is what drives her mother into prostitution to pay her evil foster parents to keep her — and her mother's death spurs Valjean into finding her and rescuing her. When she's all grown up, she then attracts Marius's attention. She doesn't actually do anything herself and she's mostly along for the ride when Valjean flees from the police. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And she's one of the few characters to survive the book, presumably because she did so very little</span>. Most commentators agree that she serves more as a symbol of hope, love and goodness than as an actual character.
</li><li> Case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamGibson">William Gibson</a>, it's difficult to name one decision made in the book that's solely his as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the real chess game is played by two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a>, mostly offscreen</span>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">Richard</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a></em>. It takes him over half the book before he <em>really</em> does anything terribly useful, and it wasn't exactly proactive on his part, either. He finally does start to take more initiative down the road, but for most of the story he is merely a vessel for viewing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">London Below</a> and the events unfolding around his companions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OliverTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OliverTwist">Oliver Twist</a></em>: Oliver is a helpless orphan boy who is pushed from one set of circumstances to another without any real power. In fact, his inaction is his greatest triumph, as he never gets corrupted by his ill fortunes.
</li></ul><ul><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePinballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePinballs">The Pinballs</a></em>, where Carlie's speech about the three protagonists being pinballs evokes a very dark interpretation of this trope. Justified since she's an abused child, also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she ultimately renounces her claim</span>.
</li><li> Since he serves as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonPeripheralNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonPeripheralNarrator">First-Person Peripheral Narrator</a>, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APrayerForOwenMeany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APrayerForOwenMeany">A Prayer for Owen Meany</a></em>, Johnny Wheelwright is this. Owen is the driving force of the plot. Johnny is there for the ride.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RavenorVsEisenhorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RavenorVsEisenhorn">Ravenor vs. Eisenhorn</a></em>, Beta spends most of the novel either fleeing from or captured by various groups that want to exploit her unique abilities. She tries to be proactive and assert her own agency, but seldom gets the chance, and her escapes are due as much to the intervention of complete strangers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0c70k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0c70k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0c70k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who <em>also</em> want to exploit her</span> as to anything she does.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewReilly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewReilly">Matthew Reilly</a> books, Shane Schofield spends the first few chapters of every book he's in in this state, usually because he's reacting to whatever group is trying to kill him this time and finding out what they want. <em>Then</em> he starts hitting back.
</li></ul><ul><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSharingKnife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSharingKnife">The Sharing Knife</a></em>. In terms of plot, almost everything that happens is because of her primary love interest, with her dragged along for the ride. When fighting starts, said love interest is impressive even for a member of the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">Superior Species</a>, whereas she's physically unsuited to combat and tries to stay out of the way. However, as the series progresses she learns more self-confidence. To the point that when her husband is threatened, she defies an entire camp of sorcerers to ride out and rescue him.
</li><li> Bernadette Manuelito is this in the murder mystery <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyHillerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TonyHillerman">The Sinister Pig</a></em>. She asks interesting questions as a Border Patrol officer and talks to a variety of people, but the murder mystery is solved by other officers Chee and Leaphorn; the whole plot is resolved when Bernadette walks straight into a trap, and a different character (who's been developed in other parts of the book) solves everything.
</li><li> Out of all the point of view characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, Sansa Stark stands out as being the most reactive and passive, spending much of her early page time being pushed around by other characters. This is justified — she's a naive preteen girl, and unlike the others, she's in no position to be proactive. Part of her storyline is shedding this trope and gaining her own agency, which ironically starts happening once she's under the guardianship of the biggest manipulator in the series. One notable thing she does accomplish is showing kindness to Sandor, despite his antagonistic nature. This has rippling effects down the line, including possibly affecting his decision to escort her sister, Arya.
</li><li> The protagonist and narrator of Iain Bank's <em>A Song of Stone</em> is an aristocrat called Abel living during in a civil war. He starts the novel trying to escape from the country with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">wife/sister Morgan</a> but gets caught up with a group of soldiers and has very little control over the plot from that point onwards.

In terms of rebuilding society in the wake of an apocalyptic event, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> actually do quite a bit.

Then again, they <em>are</em> very interesting characters.
</li><li> <em>Stuck in Neutral</em> by Terry Trueman has a justified example that's probably impossible to top. The main character can't control his muscle movements enough to communicate in any fashion, and it's commonly assumed by those around him that he doesn't even have a mind. The "plot", such as it is, is his commenting on how his life is and how people react to him, with him unable to change anything <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even to save his own life.</span>

<ul><li> Despite being the main protagonist and narrator, Bella does very little to move the plot forwards of her own accord, mostly just reacting to events around her whilst the others characters (mostly Edward or Jacob) resolve conflict for her. This may be partly justified in that she's human and so stands little chance against supernatural enemies; case-in-point, she only actively starts contributing to the plot of her own volition towards the end of <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after she's turned into a vampire</span>.

Sheldon can't find any flaw in this logic, which causes a temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>; he spends the rest of the episode watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie">Little House on the Prairie</a></em>, Amy's favorite TV show, in an attempt to find flaws in it (mostly historical inaccuracies) and get revenge on her. The guys later watch the movie again to see if there is any way around it, and the best they could determine is at least Indy was present to actually recover the Ark (but again point out that it was taken from him to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretGovernmentWarehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretGovernmentWarehouse">Secret Government Warehouse</a>, so he couldn't even get it to a museum like he hoped).

The Doctor has only very few lines in the story because William Hartnell's health was failing, and even spends a whole middle episode asleep (apparently for no reason); and his plan for dealing with the evil planet draining the Earth's energy is incredibly passive  simply to wait for it to die, which he says it will do in a couple of hours. Unfortunately, his expansive apparent knowledge followed by his sudden absence ramps up the paranoia among the humans to a fever pitch, to the point where everyone turns against him and the General even accuses him of killing his son. Even after his prediction turns out to be right and the planet dies, it's a hollow victory, as the Doctor's unconsciousness is revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> foreshadowing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">majorly controversial plot decision</a>.

His only action that really affects the plot is increasing the power of the electromagnetism on the satellite segment, with most of the other victories being the payoffs of other cast members with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>.

He does help create a device for affecting the gravity problems but it's clearly shown Romana could have done it just as easily on her own and would have done it without his help. He is present while the Anethians get out of the labyrinth but K-9 is the one who actually does all of the work, and the Doctor even argues with K-9's solution and is proven wrong. Even getting Romana and K-9 there in the first place can't be attributed to him, since they all got pulled down there by the gravity device. The only things he does that affect the plot are getting K-9 back from Soldeed and discovering the Nimons' ship. This was likely an intentional attempt to control Tom Baker's level of involvement, as he'd been getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector">very controlling</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">unstable</a> at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E7Logopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E7Logopolis">"Logopolis"</a>. The Doctor only does three things in the story that affect events at all, two of which are just landing the TARDIS in the first place (one to fall for the Police Box trap, and the other to go to Logopolis). The third is sending the Charged Vaccuum Emboitment into Cassiopeia.
</li><li> The Doctor spends almost half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E3Kinda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E3Kinda">"Kinda"</a> in a jail cell, and subsequently is mostly just there to explain what's going on to Todd while the Kinda solve their own problems. Tegan spends most of the story possessed and Nyssa is completely missing in action. The most proactive character from Team TARDIS is Adric; sure, everything he tries fails, but at least he's <em>doing something</em>.

Orcini completes the job by blowing up Davros' new Dalek army, something he could have done without the Doctor's assistance, and the Doctor's sole contribution is to prevent collateral damage by helping evacuate the area first.

The Doctor <em>does</em> deactivate the explosives Halpen had set up to destroy the Ood brain but he's a very minor player in events.

Rory is used as the viewpoint character for much of the episode, and doesn't influence events at all beyond being a prop through which Oswin can interact with the plot. Amy, meanwhile, is only there for some rather contrived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">Cannot Spit It Out</a> romantic drama, and has even less to do with anything that happens.

They'd have little fits of trying to do something, only to be completely stymied, and then they'd go "Oh... no..." and sink back into frustrating helplessness. Early on, the show was mostly about introducing the various... erm... pinballs and the Island and there were many pinballs in play. Later on, the show began to conform to this trope less and less.

He wanders all the way to the Perilous Lands where he's promptly knocked unconscious by a spirit-destroying bracelet given to him by Morgana. Merlin follows in his wake, meets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FisherKing">Fisher King</a>, retrieves the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin">McGuffin</a> (the trident is useless) and is told that the entire journey was for <em>his</em> benefit.

<ul><li> Fans of the NFL, when discussing which quarterback is better than another, tend to fall into two distinct categories. One school believes that a quarterback's statistical achievement determines his greatness. The second cares less about the stats and more about his leadership—the best quarterbacks are the ones who win games and bring home championships, even if their stats don't always impress. When the Baltimore Ravens won the Super Bowl in 2001, it was due almost entirely to a defense of almost legendary repute. Their quarterback that year was Trent Dilfer, who bounced around from team to team his entire career and was never any better than strictly average throughout. He won the Super Bowl that year and was unceremoniously dumped by the team soon after. Because of this, Dilfer embodies this trope among NFL fans, and if the topic is ever brought up for any reason, Dilfer's name inevitably follows as an example. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> even drew attention to this, apologizing to TV viewers on the NFL's behalf for the MVP award not going to linebacker Ray Lewis and flat-out stating: "Trent Dilfer sucks."

Manning has the better stats in almost any regard, but he has won "only" two Super Bowls (and lost another two) whereas Brady has won five and taken his team to another three (two of them lost to Peyton's little brother Eli Manning and the Giants). While Peyton's teams did have traits of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">Every Year They Fizzle Out</a>, it is hardly the fault of the quarterback when he leaves the field with a lead and the defense fails to make a stop and it's also rather hard to blame dropped passes on the throw, rather than the catch.
</li></ul></li><li> Gene Chizik coached Auburn to the 2010 college football national championship...officially. But the most important factors that led to the championship (a powerful offensive scheme, great recruiting, and signing Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Cam Newton) happened because of his offensive coordinator, Gus Malzahn. Two years later Malzahn left to become the head coach at Arkansas State, and Auburn promptly stumbled to a 3-9 record. The school bought out Chizik's contract and replaced him with...Gus Malzahn.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series by its nature falls into this as the games all star criminal defense lawyers and prosecuting attorneys and follows them through their work on individual murder cases. In other words, they have nothing of relevance in the plot until someone drops dead and they get pulled in to defend them/prosecute them and they must rely on other people a good amount of the time to get all the information they need to win their case. That said, while the protagonists often have a reactive nature to the cases themselves, they still have their own individual character plots that play out during the game to ensure they remain a central part of the story. They're not so much irrelevant to the story (no, not even Apollo, who gets played like a puppet in his self-titled entry) as they are required to wait for something to happen so the player will have something to do. Though, really, this trope more or less comes with the territory of being an attorney, proactive work usually isnt in the job description.

Even though a major plot point of the game was exploring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conflict">Man vs. Fate conflict</a>, many players weren't sold on it and viewed it as a step back from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">first game</a>, where they could make world-changing choices. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">third game</a> returned to the old formula as a result.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> The conceit of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> — that the protagonist <em>himself</em> would decide the villain needed to be killed, and be the active aggressor while the villain acted in self-defence — was an attempt to avoid this, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact">Villains Act, Heroes React</a> is so omnipresent in eastern RPGs that the staff felt the traditional JRPG hero was a passive doormat who only sought to do what the King told him, and wanted to do something completely opposite. This is so adhered to so strongly that the plot sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">contorts itself</a> just to ensure that Cloud is the one with the agency. Of course, since the twist is that Cloud is under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">More Than Mind Control</a> this ends up being less 'the good King told him to do it' and more 'the villain compelled him to do it by taking advantage of his ignored personality problems', which may or may not be an improvement.
</li><li> Tidus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> starts off the game as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfWater">Fish out of Water</a> and while he can fight (and play blitzball better than anyone else), his ignorance of some of the most fundamental tenets of life on Spira grind rather heavily on his companions (such as his carefree talk of what they'll do after Sin is defeated, as he doesn't learn until a long while that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuna is going to willingly sacrifice herself, as all Summoners do to keep Sin away</span>).
</li><li> For roughly three quarters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, all the party does is try to survive in a world where virtually everybody wants to kill them for being L'Cie, something that was done to them without their consent for being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Most of the remaining quarter is their coming to terms with the fact that as L'Cie, they are little more than pawns in a centuries-spanning scheme that they have virtually no hope of stopping — even dying to spite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> will just delay his plans until he can find a new batch of pawns to run through the same situation.

</li><li> The characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em> get bounced around very efficiently by the villains, and (due to their social position) they can only really continue to collect all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a> required to become the King, on a pilgrimage already laid out for them. Even the eventual victory is part of a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>" prophecy and involves the payoffs of plans set in motion by side characters.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GemsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GemsOfWar">Gems of War</a></em>, the plot is linear, and the protagonist only speaks in the form of short sentences which fit on what is effectively a "continue" button. As such, the player character comes across as very laid back and obliging to whichever character is serving as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestGiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestGiver">Quest Giver</a>. ("Can I join you?" "Okay." "Will you help me?" "Sure, why not." "We must attack immediately!" "All right.") There are occasions where the player character attempts to point out the silliness of certain decisions, but he/she almost always gets carried along anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The mainline games usually avoid this, as the Master Chief (and the Arbiter) almost always end up saving the galaxy (or at least a planet) in some way or another. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em> falls pretty hard into this; if Blue Team and Fireteam Osiris had stayed home, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the titular Guardians would still have been dispersed through the galaxy, hundreds of AIs would have still defected to Cortana, and the <em>Infinity</em> would still be on the run</span>. That said, Osiris are able to make a difference in the war between the Covenant and the Swords of the Sanghelios by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Jul 'Mdama and saving the Arbiter</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotlineMiami">Hotline Miami</a></em> goes through the whole game simply following orders from his answering machine (until his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> in Part 4,) and consequently both he and the player never learn anything about what's going on behind the scenes. Richard even tells him in Part 4 that nothing he does from that point on will mean anything. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">The Biker</a>, on the other hand, is much more proactive, with his storyline revolving around figuring out who's pulling the strings.

The player has a few different paths to choose from but the Nazis are almost always one step ahead and they reach Atlantis and its god-making machine regardless of Indy's actions. The machine doesn't actually work so the antagonists would have presumably killed themselves with it or given up even if Indy had never got involved. In fact, the final puzzle is to convince the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to (fatally) use the machine on himself instead of the player.

He possesses an incredible power few characters in-story can match, but instead of completing his original quest, he tends to be unwillingly dragged in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> by multiple Chessmasters at once, each of whom tries to use Raziel for their own agenda (while he's supposed to be the <em>only</em> person in Nosgoth to have genuine free will — as a walking paradox, he stands outside of fate's control — there are so many schemes going on that no matter what he does, he ends up inadvertently advancing <em>somebody's</em> plot), so he often ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordOfPlotAdvancement">Sword of Plot Advancement</a> of sorts, rather than actual character. This quote of his sums it perfectly:

These sections do not change based on which side of the war you play on, giving the impression that the player's actions have no impact on the war whatsoever. As events are playing out by the canon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">the tabletop game</a>, any impact the player has is meaningless in the end, causing it to edge into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">Doomed by Canon</a> territory.

This was deliberate on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiInafune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeijiInafune">Keiji Inafune</a>'s part, as he wanted to set up the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a></em> series and make up for not getting to use Zero's design for X like he originally wanted.

Apart from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saving Madeline Bergman from the Metroid Queen and retrieving Adam's Helmet</span>, she doesn't really accomplish a great deal and most major issues or plot points are given to other characters.
</li><li> The playable duo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil0">Resident Evil 0</a></em>, Rebecca and Billy don't do a whole lot over the course of the game.

Any plot developments happen in cutscenes, involve Wesker and Birkin, and are completely separate from what the protagonists are doing. Though really, this is true of all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> games until the fourth came along. Typically, the plot involves running around just trying to stay alive amidst odd enemies and even odder puzzles while the plot works independently of you. All those storylines would have had the exact same outcomes had Chris, Jill, Claire, Leon, Carlos, and the rest died within the first 30 seconds.
<ul><li> You can honestly say this about the majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivalHorror">Survival Horror</a> protagonists, not just the ones from <em>Resident Evil</em>, where the biggest concern for the player characters is usually just staying alive long enough to escape from whatever horrific situation they've gotten into. It's right there in the genre's name, as a matter of fact.

As such, he is recruited by the HCU, and his main job is to help them with their investigations. While the player as Akira does most of the grunt work by exploring various locations and gathering up clues, the majority of plot-important actions are actually carried out by the other members of the HCU. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also, it's eventually revealed that Akira never really had free will in the first place, as he was mentally conditioned by the FSO syndicate to become a future iteration of Kamui Uehara.

Sonic is a very reactive character, whose's mission is to save Princess Elise from Doctor Eggman, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">for no special reason</a>". However, Sonic's storyline doesn't deal with the bigger picture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mephiles</a> who fooled Silver to kill Sonic, with Silver just appearing randomly to fight him and then deciding that "circumstances have changed"; nor Sonic ever finds out about the Solaris project that Shadow discovers as he fights with Mephiles, even when Shadow and Rouge just randomly appear in the future Eggman sends him in. The storyline purpose is to build Sonic's friendship/romance with Elise for the final story arc, which plays a role in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Elise reviving Sonic with a kiss</span> (<span style="display:none">invoked</span><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">which is gross</a>). This in turn is reflected on Sonic "amigos", Tails and Knuckles, who like Sonic just appear out of nowhere in Soleanna to help him, but have no arc or plot to themselves, which is baffling for Knuckles as his role as the guardian of the Master Emerald is never acknowledged. That, and Sonic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">literally a pinball</a> in some games.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em>, where the main character constantly asserts that everything he's doing, no matter how horrible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">is because Konrad keeps forcing his hand</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then it turns out Konrad was a hallucination the entire time, and he could've easily stopped at any point.</span>
</li><li> Alex from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a></em> coined the Japanese counterpart of the trope, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">main character (lol)</a>." He was meant to be the next hero of the series representing a new generation of fighters. But with no projectile and two command throws, he fit the grappler image better. Which would have been fine except combined with his all-rounder stats, nothing about him really stood out. Worse, Ryu was still where the Player 1 cursor started and Alex's ending had him losing horribly to said previous protagonist. Not fitting the main character mold was one thing but becoming completely overshadowed as well sealed it.

But as these games were turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a> series en masse by Kyoto animation, the fact that the boys simply bounce from girl to girl helping them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">resolve</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">issues</a> can be bothersome.
</li><li> Luke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em> is this trope for the first part of the game. He's just a sheltered noble who by circumstance ends up kidnapped and dragged halfway around the world and back by others.

</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> series, as the overall progress of the war depends on your performance in certain key missions; later games in the series give you the opportunity to make decisions and influence the story with dialogue options.

<ul><li> Lampshaded (like everything else) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/FreemansMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/FreemansMind">Freeman's Mind</a></em>. Gordon mentions at various points that he's "just a rat in a maze...with no cheese", and that he's "caught in the middle of some cosmic politics."
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PoohsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/PoohsAdventures">Pooh's Adventures</a></em> series on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">The title character</a> doesn't do anything to change the plot of whatever movie he is in, just spouting off random comments. In fact, when it does come time to fight off the major enemy, it's usually someone else who defeats the villain.
</li><li> Most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em> falls into this, especially in the first five seasons. Calling the Blood Gulch crew "reactive protagonists" would be stretching for a compliment, honestly. When left to their own devices, the most they'll instigate by themselves is childish bickering.
</li><li> Although they're nominally the main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>, Team RWBY tend to have little, if any effect on the plot's progression in the first three seasons. Most of their battles tend to end with the bad guys escaping unharmed, someone else swooping in to beat the bad guys, or the bad guys just winning outright. Only by Season 4 have they actually truly taken steps to confront the bad guys directly, which also coincides with those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTakesAnInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTakesAnInterest">bad guys taking an interest</a> in <em>them</em> (or at least Ruby), for their special powers that could prove a threat. Later seasons have taken strides to avert this trope, especially in regards to Ruby, by giving them more pivotal moments in defeating villains than letting someone else do it for them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>: Most of the episode "Monster" is Finn and Jake tracking down Lumpy Space Princess, listening to her story about her adventures since running away from home, and being there for her when the villagers she was extorting confront her and cause her to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">Jerkass Realization</a>. At the end, when Lumpy Space King and Lumpy Space Queen thank them for returning their daughter, Jake lampshades it by saying "Eh, we really didn't do much."
</li><li> Omar of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockAndRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockAndRule">Rock &amp; Rule</a></em> just sits back and look petulant while his sidekicks take the initiative to find Angel. Once he realizes what kind of danger she's in, he turns around and actually comes off as quite heroic.
