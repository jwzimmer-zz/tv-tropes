</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A person who represents themselves in court without the assistance of an attorney, whether as the defendant or the plaintiff, and whether or not the issue before the court is criminal or civil, is said to be operating <em>pro se</em> (a Latin phrase meaning "for oneself"). In the United States, at least, the right of a member of the public to represent themselves predates the existence of the U.S. Constitution, and it is generally considered a part of the protected right to seek a redress of grievances.
</p><p>In general, most legal professionals consider a person going to court without the aid of an attorney to be a really bad idea, even when the litigant <em>is an attorney themselves</em>. Not all attorneys are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryLawyer">versed in all forms of law</a>; how many alleged murderers does the average tax lawyer defend in their lifetime, after all? Furthermore, even if said attorney <em>is</em> an expert in that precise field of law, being that close to the matter at hand is a great way to lose sight of the big picture.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mhxc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1mhxc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mhxc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For similar reasons, it is also considered a bad idea for a lawyer to represent a family member or close friend. To illustrate the need for a certain amount of emotional distance, picture a scenario in which a lawyer represents her brother and is offered a plea deal of ten years when going to trial means a potential life sentence. She might feel strongly that her brother is innocent and should not serve any time for a crime he didn't commit, where another attorney would recommend taking the deal. Conversely, she might advise him to take the deal out of fear of him going to prison for life, when there's a good enough chance of winning to justify fighting the charges. Being emotionally involved, whether the client is oneself or a loved one, can color one's (otherwise good) judgment.</span> There is a reason why the adage in full often reads as some variation of "The man who represents himself has a fool for a client <em>and an ass for an attorney.</em>"

</p><p>Almost always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by someone asking the character if he is aware of the adage. Naturally this appears quite often in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawProcedural">Courtroom Drama</a>. In comedies, the <em>pro se</em> character often engages in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics">Courtroom Antics</a> that would get him thrown into jail in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, but because it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, the character will often get away with it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2fpqf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2fpqf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2fpqf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A bit of Truth In Television here, as judges are usually more tolerant of irregularities from those who are appearing <em>pro se</em> and don't know the rules than they would be of an attorney, who should presumably know better; though it's still possible to take it way too far, and repeatedly engaging in behavior you've been warned against WILL get you jailed for contempt</span>.

While this is met with shock (and his lawyer rubbing her temples), the defense itself goes pretty smoothly thanks to the Justice League stepping in.
</li><li> In the 2011 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> series, this actually becomes attorney Matt Murdock's new business plan. Since Matt Murdock is widely suspected of secretly being Daredevil, it becomes difficult for him to represent clients effectively. So he and his partner Foggy Nelson start a new business — coaching clients who can't afford or don't want to hire counsel to effectively represent themselves in court.
</li><li> In the 2015 Free Comic Book Day strip for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo">Atomic Robo</a></em>, Dr. Dinosaur represents himself in court.

He manages to get himself acquitted despite a signed confession, a murder weapon, and motive. The way he was able to do this was that the investigating detective was sleeping with the victim (the killer's wife) making the confession suspect when the detective's testimony of it was undermined, and the murder weapon had never been fired (he had switched it with the detective's weapon as they were identical models). As for motive, without evidence it's useless. This was helped by the fact that the prosecutor had his foot out the door as he was about to get a job at a prestigious law firm and wasn't taking the case very seriously due to the mountain of evidence. Crawford also purposely used an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> angle to appear like an easy win to the haughty and uninterested public prosecutor. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When the prosecutor then finds a way to try Crawford for murder, Crawford hires a defense team of 4+ lawyers.

They find books on law at his home when they arrest him. He's not a lawyer, but he's smart enough to handle his defense purely on what he taught himself. Also, he never goes to trial, it's just at his bail hearing, and he mocks the judge for accepting his legal arguments to provoke her into sending him to jail. All part of his plan.

If the Chanels had just bothered to get a half-decent lawyer, they would have gotten out scot-free.

<ul><li> In 1961, Clarence Earl Gideon, a drifter who had recently taken up being an electrician, was accused of breaking and entering after a Panama City, FL pool hall was robbed of some small change and beverages. Too poor to afford an attorney, he was subsequently denied a public defender by the judge (only in capital crimes did the judge have to provide a public defender). He represented himself in his criminal trial, and although observers say he did a pretty good job for a <em>pro se</em> defendant, he was found guilty of breaking and entering and sentenced to five years in prison. While in prison, Gideon appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, who (in a unanimous decision) ruled that all criminal defendants have the right to legal counsel. Gideon received a new trial, and with the aid of an attorney was acquitted of the crime. This was made into the movie <em>Gideon's Trumpet</em> (starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryFonda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryFonda">Henry Fonda</a> as Gideon).

Despite a lack of any tangible legal knowledge, and despite angering both the prosecution, the judge, and <em>the other defense attorneys</em> (and their clients, the other mobsters) with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics">Courtroom Antics</a>, he was eventually found not guilty, along with the rest of the defendants, following a trial which lasted over a year (which some felt was the reason for the mass acquittal by the jury, as revenge on the prosecution for keeping them there so long).
</li><li> Serial killer Ted Bundy acted as his own attorney in his 1980 trial. The judge complimented him on doing a good job, in fact, and commented that Bundy might have made a good attorney. Even so, he wasn't good enough to keep himself out of the electric chair (Bundy had represented himself while on trial in Colorado earlier, and escaped by jumping out of a law library window where he had been allowed access to research his case).

It didn't quite work the way he wanted, especially since he had already been declared a vexatious litigant by the State of Florida by that time and was not able to file anything without prior approval from another member of the Florida Bar.
</li><li> Courts, especially lower courts (County, District, Local, Magistrates, etc.) will bend over backwards to accommodate self-represented litigants who at least are trying to get their matter resolved. The rather amusing spectacle of a Magistrate actively helping a defendant with their case (and sometimes even Police Prosecutors, who while not allowed to directly help, may slip the defendant copies of exonerating evidence they forgot to bring to the court) is fairly common in most courtrooms. They also tend to be far more tolerant and forgiving of behavior that would usually be considered improper (as the average pro se litigant cannot reasonably be expected to have sufficient knowledge of proper courtroom behavior and procedure), but only up to a point; blatant abuse of the court's largesse or malicious, vindictive litigation will get a litigant torn apart and potentially barred from ever filing anything again without prior court approval and (usually) posting a substantial contempt bond in case the court decides to fine them.
</li><li> David Irving represented himself in his libel suit against Deborah Lipstadt for calling him a Holocaust denier. It was not a great success, seeing as how the judge <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hdot.org/en/trial/judgement">ruled in Lipstadt's favor, officially declaring Irving to be a racist, anti-Semite, misogynist and Holocaust denier who associates with neo-Nazis in the final verdict<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Particular lowlights included pedantically arguing with defense witness Richard J. Evans over which of them was an "expert in pit-digging" for five minutes, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">addressing the judge as "mein Führer" in front of the entire court</a>.
<ul><li> The latter trial was fictionalized in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Denial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Denial">Denial</a></em>, although the movie does not feature the afforementioned lowlights.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://asianhistory.about.com/od/profilesofasianleaders/p/fmarcosbio.htm">Ferdinand Marcos<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was once accused of taking part in a politically-motivated assassination. Long story short, he represented himself and won. He became the President of the Philippines before implementing martial law and becoming a dictator. He was removed from power following the People Power Revolution (also known as the EDSA revolution) in 1986.
</li><li> Cult leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesManson">Charles Manson</a> was notorious for demanding to represent himself at his trial for his mass murders despite the pleas of the judge to reconsider. Of course, the fact that he is completely deranged made him hopeless at doing that, making insane motions and requests.
</li><li> Legal practitioners wince when they hear in a bankruptcy court that a bankruptcy order should not be made against a debtor because... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">"I don't have any money."</a> It's so natural to say it! However, that's why they're in a bankruptcy court.
</li><li> Pornographer Larry Flynt was known for defending himself occasionally, and to cause quite a spectacle when doing so, as portrayed by Woody Harrelson in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePeopleVsLarryFlynt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePeopleVsLarryFlynt">The People vs. Larry Flynt</a></em>. In fact, Flynt's most outrageous antics were in response to the U.S. Supreme Court not allowing him to appear <em>pro se</em>.
</li><li> When can you represent yourself and have two fools for a client? When you're representing yourself <em>against</em> yourself. See <a class="urllink" href="https://loweringthebar.net/2011/04/the-man-who-sued-himself.html">Lodi v. Lodi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, 1985.
</li><li> As explained above, most <em>pro se</em> defendants and litigants are actually arguing in good faith and making a genuine effort to be reasonable within the standards of the law. However, an increasingly large class of people, defined as 'OPCA litigants' by Judge Rooke (in Alberta, Canada) stand before the court on their own because their antics are so outrageous that no sane lawyer would represent them. A recent and infamous example is Ryan Bundy, who <a class="urllink" href="http://wonkette.com/604979/surprise-ryan-bundy-goes-full-sovereign-citizen-declares-self-idiot-not-subject-to-your-damn-laws">not only decided upon pro se representation but subsequently claimed that he was incompetent to stand trial -- in his own words, declaring himself an idiot -- and attempted to charge the court millions of dollars for his time.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Similar courtroom antics have led to many judges growing increasingly frustrated with <em>pro se</em> representation, whether warranted or not.
</li><li> Like most of his revolutionary peers, Georges Danton was a lawyer by trade and an eloquent orator to boot, so when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchRevolution">French Revolution</a> (or rather, Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety) turned against him and put him in front of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a>, Danton - who was denied counsel - was more than willing and able to handle his own defense. His death may have been pre-decided (and indeed it was) and the proceedings may have been a farce, but by the Supreme Being, Georges Danton would not go down without a fight. He used any trick in the book and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics">Courtroom Antics</a> to get justice and sway the opinion of the spectators; he nearly got away with it, but when he demanded his right to call witnesses (which he clearly had according to the letter and spirit of the law), the tribunal whose only purpose was a guilty verdict had enough and denied Danton and all other defendants the right to appear before the court again. The "guilty" verdict was handed down shortly afterwards, and Danton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">had his date with Madame Guillotine</a> a little after that.
</li><li> Dylann Roof, the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina church shooter, attempted this in 2016 and was quickly found guilty of nine counts of murder.
</li><li> James Romine of Digital Homicide represented himself in his lawsuit against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jimquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jimquisition">Jim Sterling</a> for the reason that he couldn't afford an attorney. A look at the details reveals exactly why getting a lawyer is heavily advised: Romine attempted to sue in the name of Digital Homicide LLC (a company cannot represent pro se, it has to have an attorney), via a court in Arizona (Jim Sterling isn't a resident of Arizona nor does he strictly speaking conduct business in the state, so the court had no jurisdiction over him) and with poorly presented arguments that fell straight into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">Frivolous Lawsuit</a>, claiming damages of <em>$10 million</em> which only rose as the case went on. Romine's incompetence was to the point that in Sterling's post-mortem of the case, he notes that he and his allies' reaction to Romine's antics boiled down to 'I have no idea what he's doing'.
</li><li> In ancient Athens, there were no lawyers, so parties had to represent themselves (unless they were women or children, in which case their male guardians did). They were allowed to hire speechwriters, but that was it. Naturally, this led to a lot more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntics">Courtroom Antics</a>, and the judges too were ordinary people selected by lot. See the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApologyOfSocrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApologyOfSocrates">Apology of Socrates</a></em> for a famous example of such a trial.
</li><li> An infamous discussion of the concept: During the infamously inflammatory court hearing of Denver Fenton Allen, a convict who demanded a different public defender than the one he got (supposedly because that defense attorney was demanding sexual favors from him), Judge J. Bryant Durham explicitly told Allen that his only other choice would be to represent himself, which he then explains is a terrible idea.
<div class="indent"><strong>Judge Durham:</strong> Well, you've got two choices. One, you can go to trial with him, or, two, you can try the case yourself. Now, I definitely, completely think that that's- Wait a minute. Listen to me. That would be the biggest mistake you've ever made in your life. <br/><strong>Denver Fenton Allen:</strong> So, basically you're sitting here telling me you're going to find me guilty if I-if I go to trial and try to defend myself? <br/><strong>Judge Durham:</strong> You're probably right. That would be my best guess if you try to defend yourself. You-you don't know anything about selecting a jury, do you? <br/><strong>Denver Fenton Allen:</strong> No. <br/><strong>Judge Durham:</strong> Do you know anything about cross-examining witnesses? <br/><strong>Denver Fenton Allen:</strong> No. <br/><strong>Judge Durham:</strong> Do you know anything about criminal procedure? <br/><strong>Denver Fenton Allen:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">I know I don't have to let this guy suck my dick to get some legal representation.</a>
</div></li><li> High School dropout Harold J. Stewards <a class="urllink" href="https://jonathanturley.org/2008/03/17/no-fool-i-high-school-dropout-represents-himself-and-beats-murder-charge/">defended himself against a first-degree murder charge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and managed to get an acquittal. He previously refused a proposition from his former defense attorney to plead guilty for second-degree murder.
</li><li> Averted with French <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchCourts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchCourts">''Cours d'assisses''</a>, where any accused has to have a defendant.
</li><li> Bradley Cunningham, who murdered his wife Cheryl Keeton in 1986, acted as his own defense attorney. Given the gap between the murder and the actual criminal trial, plus the lack of physical evidence <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5s6tl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5s6tl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5s6tl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Well, <em>actionable</em> physical evidence; a big problem in spousal murder cases is that, with shared spaces and property (in this case, the car), there are too many normal reasons for someone's fingerprints, hair, etc to be there for it to count.</span>, a real lawyer would probably have gotten him acquitted, but Cunningham's rambling egotistical tangents about how rich he was, repeated slut-shaming of Cheryl, and total ignorance of legal procedure (he tried to <em>argue with the judge</em> about how things were supposed to work) utterly destroyed whatever chance he might have had of getting away with it.
