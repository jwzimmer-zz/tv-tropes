In most cases, this is used to create comedic tension; for example, when a character has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSecret">Big Secret</a> he must struggle to divert conversation away from. In stark contrast, some cases of the trope create a <em>tragic</em> vibe, with an Elephant so awful that nobody can bring themselves to raise the topic.
</p><p>For cases where there is a subject within the series that simply cannot be questioned, or else the whole premise will fall apart, it's a case of why they don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan">Just Eat Gilligan</a>.

It refers to an issue which the electorate both feels strongly about, and is sharply divided on what to do about it; therefore, a compromise solution is unlikely to satisfy anyone and will just make everyone angry. As a result, no one attempts to do anything.
</p><p>In Anime, this trope is known as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterSeahorse">Pregnant</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma</a> Problem</em>, based on the following anecdotal discussion between the author/artist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> and a random fan at a convention:

<ul><li> One public awareness commercial has a man walking into an office accompanied by an elephant, with the nametag of "AIDS." Certainly a very effective message.
</li><li> Ads for AXA Equities invoke this trope by having as a spokesperson the proverbial 800-pound gorilla in the room, reminding people to invest for retirement. Which is a <em>bizarrely</em> mixed metaphor. The proverbial 800-pound gorilla represents the ability to do whatever you want because nobody dares to stop you...
<div class="indent"> Where do you invest your money when there's an 800-pound gorilla in the room? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce">Anywhere he tells you to.</a></em>
</div></li><li> An ad shows a couple's living room and points out new things, whenever the curtain is pulled back. The third time this happens a huge fluff dinosaur is standing behind them  the announcer points to a small cactus on the coffee table.
</li><li> A PSA about drinking and driving shows a party where the guests are drinking alcohol. One of the guests puts down his glass and grabs his car keys. The hosts ask him if he is OK to drive. He says that he is fine to drive, which triggers a large inflatable elephant to inflate in a manner similar to a car's air bag. The message is not to ignore drinking and driving like the proverbial elephant in the room.
</li><li> An ad for an asthma inhaler has a guy mentioning how trying to breathe when you have asthma can feel like this, then the camera pans back to show an elephant sitting on his chest. And then it shows the person going about his/her activities with the elephant following. It isn't doing anything, it isn't bothering anyone, it is just THERE. (The idea being that the inhaler isn't a cure for asthma, but it makes it possible to live with it.)
</li><li> A Doritos ad has an office worker with an elephant that keeps smacking his coworkers for trying to take some Doritos. At the end, one asks, "Are we gonna talk about this?" The worker simply replies "No."
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One of Kousaka's major character traits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em> is that he has absolutely no awareness that the elephant in the room is supposed to be hiding. As a result, he says what everyone's thinking without hesitation. A key example is when the rest of the club is unsure of whether Ohno and Tanaka are dating; as everyone else vacillates, he just yells, "Hey! Are you two going out?"
</li><li> The big one from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>, eventually brought up in a recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novel</a> for the series: what will happen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance">Keiichi and Belldandy's relationship</a> as Keiichi grows old? Interestingly, Keiichi and Peorth <em>did</em> have a rather evasive conversation about it. Keiichi's biggest concern, to Peorth's surprise, was how it would hurt Belldandy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kanokon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kanokon">Kanokon</a></em>. The female lead is some 25+ times older than the male. That means, by the time he dies of old age, she'll only <em>just</em> have got out of adolescence. Yet no-one mentions it, ever. In the manga, Kouta does angst about it a bit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CromartieHighSchool">Cromartie High School</a></em>, no one but Kamiyama and Hayashida seem to realize that Mechazawa is a robot, and even they never directly say it. This and the general weirdness is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the last scene of the anime: Hayashida and Maeda ask Kamiyama what they're going to with their lives. Kamiyama then points out the window to Mechazawa, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">Freddie</a>, his horse, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys">Gorilla</a>, stating that's whatever the three of them might do doesn't interest him nearly as much as <em>what those other guys</em> might do.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, Conan's increasingly noticeable failure to act as a normal little boy arouses suspicions from just about everyone in the cast not privy to his secret, yet nobody really thinks of just sitting the kid down and asking him just how on earth does he know so much, rather preferring to harbor vague suspicions relatively forever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's revealed that Captain Komamura, whose face was concealed up to that point, has the head of a wolf. Some characters are surprised by it, but literally no one questions why he looks like that. It's (much) later revealed Komamura comes from a werewolf clan that was cursed for their ignorance a long time ago; the curse traps them in an animalistic form, and the further into ignorance they descend, the more animalistic they become. Full descent results in a member of the clan becoming a proper wolf.
</li><li> In one filler arc, Ichigo indignantly demands to know how the members of two noble clans didn't figure out that the others were noble in spite of using their distinctive clan names. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">Rukia hastily convinces him to ignore the issue.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: Villetta Nu is one of the people who informs the Black Knights about Geass. The Black Knights do not put her to task for her connections to Britannia or her secret tryst with Ohgi, who isn't questioned for the latter either, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> threatening to gun down Kallen along with Lelouch on suspicion of being Geassed, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">jumping to conclusions regarding Lelouch himself</a>. (Then again, neither is the fact that Schneizel is the most notorious of the opposing royals, in the case of R2 19.)</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>
<ul><li> Kishimoto rarely, if ever, touches upon the largest example in the series: The subject of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a>. Late into the manga, though, there's some talking about it.
</li><li> It wasn't until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie">The Last: Naruto the Movie</a></em> that Hinata's love confession to Naruto during the Pain arc was acknowledged. Granted, immediately after the Pain Arc, Naruto was faced with the issue of Sasuke being marked for death, and shortly afterward, the Fourth Shinobi World War broke out, so there wasn't much of a chance to sit down and talk with Hinata about it. In-series it took Naruto <em>three years</em> to mention the elephant in the bedroom. The reason given is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because of his background as an ostrasized orphan, Naruto has trouble understanding the different types of love. He thought that Hinata's confession was <em>platonic</em> for three years.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo">Oreimo</a></em> doesn't touch upon the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> aspects of the series (past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestSubtext">subtext</a>), especially compared to the manga and light novel.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a>, Commander Pixis states the awful truth that everyone knows but refuses to talk about: that they are fed and alive today because thousands were sent to their deaths five years ago, after the fall of Wall Maria, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">"reclaim lost territory from the Titans"</a>, simply because the land inside the two remaining walls couldn't support everyone. He goes even further and says all of them bear the weight of that sin and that things will get <em>worse</em> for humanity if Wall Rose falls as well. This harsh realization is what motivates everyone to stand their ground.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>
<ul><li> In the original series, it was opened questions among the cast to what Goku was. He was a strange boy with a tail who was exceptional strong to the point several characters questioned if he was human before eventually saying nothing more about it. It becomes a wonder why anyone was surprised when they learned that he was an alien. Then again, they are many strange things in this version of Earth.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>'s Cell Saga, it's blatantly obvious that Krillin has developed feelings for Android 18; when he tries to use a wish to turn her and 17 human, only Gohan doesn't get why...but then he realizes it and just blurts out "Hey, you've got a crush on her, don't you?", prompting an exasperated Krillin to punch him in the head.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Fables">Fables</a></em>, the protagonists rarely talk about much of their pasts, even if it was full of abominable deeds. Which, considering they're all old-school <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grimmification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grimmification">Grimm</a> storybook fables, can be extensive indeed. The in-story explanation is they were all given amnesty when they entered the mundane world. This doesn't keep them from being wary of each other, nor from falling back on old habits.
</li><li> Despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>'s version of New York City has been the site of multiple alien invasions, a demonic infestation, has suffered through every kind of cockamamie plot imaginable, and is routinely targeted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supervillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Supervillain">supervillains</a> of every stripe, there has never been any sort of mass exodus or serious damage to the economy in spite of all the upheavals. (Probably because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DamageControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DamageControl">Damage Control</a> repairs everything so efficiently.) When 9/11 rolled around, it portrayed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>, and Dr. Doom as sincerely moved. Problem is, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> has had much worse. Magneto was actually <em>killed</em> in such an attack, on Genosha, which killed 16 million people. 9/11, by MU standards, was actually a low-impact event. Furthermore, while the Kingpin might be moved by love for his city, there is no real reason why Dr. Doom would care either way. All comics publishers were in a bind there, because with New York as the home of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> in the same state, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> <em>on Earth</em>, it's hard to believe it could still happen, but would have been seen as disrespectful to ignore it. It gets worse. Juggernaut was seen there crying. Juggernaut, in the past, has actually knocked down one of the two buildings himself and laughed out loud about it.
</li><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> is that there is a group of people born with random super powers who are the next step of human evolution. Society fears those mutants and their powers, and all mutants have to endure the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>. So what about the <em>other</em> superheroes of the Marvel Universe? How can mutant heroes be feared because of their powers while non-mutant heroes, such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, be loved as celebrities? Why do the people fear Sunfire, a guy who can fly and light himself on fire, and love the Human Torch, another guy who can fly and light himself on fire? As a result, most adaptions of the X-Men to other media simply skip the Marvel Universe as a whole, and focus just on the parts of it related to the X-Men.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, Spider-Man's secret identity becomes this among Peter Parker's group of friends. Eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Kenny "Kong" McFarlane:
<div class="indent"> <em>What, you want us to have some kind of secret code? "Oh, if only Spider-Man were here and could go after our friend!"</em>
</div></li><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>'s home town of Gotham City never suffers from any long-term economic damage or loss of population, even though a number of psychopathic supervillains routinely use the city as a stage for their grisly "performances" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>), a giant petri dish for their scientific experiments (the Scarecrow), or a base for their environmental crusades (Poison Ivy). Ignoring them, the city has long been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> of endemic police and civic corruption and mob activity, making it curious that anyone would willingly choose to live there. Although the population <em>did</em> take a permanent nosedive after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanNoMansLand">Batman: No Man's Land</a></em> and sections of the city were rendered uninhabitable, it was still a rather busy city.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shadowpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shadowpact">Shadowpact</a></em>, it is implied that the ancient entity (who later takes the name "Dr. Gotham", after the city that's been built over him) sleeping beneath Gotham City for untold ages has been influencing the dark trend of everything in the city.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Stormwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Stormwatch">Stormwatch</a></em>, city-speaker Jack Hawksmoor has a tête-a-tete with the personification of Gotham, who is shown as a demented goblin/gargoyle.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">The Question</a></em> on the same topic. Hub City was so crime-filled that the honest citizens eventually <em>evacuated</em> the place and abandoned it to the gangs.
</li></ul></li><li> This issue <em>is</em> actually addressed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em>: people continue to live in the eponymous city in spite of the constant super-crime because of the sense of community fostered by having to work together to rebuild after battles. And because having a lot of superheroes around is cool.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MiniMarvels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MiniMarvels">Mini Marvels</a></em> parodies this trope with Elephant Steve. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">really hates</a> this expression, by the way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddWinick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuddWinick">Judd Winick</a>'s <em>Pedro and Me</em> has a sequence where he compares living with cameras filming your every move to living with elephants. You just feel the need to point them out.
</li><li> An old example is the way white people are overrepresented in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">The Golden Age of Comic Books</a>. We the readers know that this is because that's how you made superheroes comics back then, but it's very strange how nobody in-story ever notices the lack of super-powered non-whites.
</li><li> The last arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> involves several elephants from the previous two arcs (Karolina's depression after losing Xavin, Nico's growing Machiavellian tendencies, Chase's bitterness over losing Gert, Victor's resentment at Nico for dumping him, and Klara's unresolved trauma issues) all suddenly colliding with each other when an ill-conceived party results in a terrible accident that leads to serious divisions in the team.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye">Transformers: More than Meets the Eye</a></em>, Krok obsessively carries a small device that he insists is sending a signal to his old squad, whom he got separated from years ago. Except it's soon obvious that it's <em>not</em> doing so and the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesJustHiding">missing squad</a>" is actually dead, with Krok being delusional from the trauma. All of the Scavengers can see it plain as day, but they're terrified of broaching the subject and just try to pretend they don't notice, to increasingly poor effect. Misfire grows steadily more fed up with dancing around the issue, eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> forcing the others to confront it by ripping the device out of Krok's hand by force.</span>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/AlleyOop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/AlleyOop">Alley Oop</a></em>, the character Oscar Boom went straight so many decades ago that many current readers weren't aware that he started out as a crook, and that he had never gone to trial or served jail time for his crimes. Recent storylines have finally addressed this.
</li><li> A literal one from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide">The Far Side</a></em>, in which a detective accuses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButlerDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButlerDidIt">the butler</a> of goring and trampling the victim, ignoring the elephant in a trench coat next to him.
<ul><li> Another strip has the elephant hiding behind a fairly small piece of furniture while the homeowners search for him.
</li><li> A similar strip features a wasp detective trying to figure out why there is a rock-shaped hole in the wasp nest that appears to have been punctured from inside the nest, somehow. Standing inside the nest is also a gigantic human child, whom everyone is ignoring (Larson apologies for the lameness of the joke in the strip's caption, saying "it was late and I was tired).

At no point does anyone explicitly mention the fact that Daisy and Violet are joined at the hip. The whole thing is going to be very awkward.
</li><li> A literal and classic example appears in the play (and later film) <em>Billy Rose's Jumbo</em>. Jimmy Durante's character is attempting to "sneak" an elephant out of his failing circus as the creditors close in. He and the elephant are of course promptly confronted by the sheriff and the repo squad:

It's never remarked upon and no one finds it strange. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationSpeciesChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationSpeciesChange">Of course, this was changed in the animated series.</a>
</li><li> The old variation in which the elephant-in-the-living-room analogy is used in reference to the obviousness of drug addiction/alcoholism is addressed in two different books of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em>. In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> says that the reaction loved ones of the addiction have upon discovering the elephant (addiction) was there is usually, "Oh, I'm sorry, was that an <em>elephant</em>? It was there when I moved in! I always assumed it was part of the <em>furniture</em>!" In the other King makes the analogy: that the reason the addict himself/herself doesn't see the "elephant in the living room" is because this elephant isn't just any ordinary elephant; it is like The Shadow in that it has the hypnotic super-ability to cloud men's minds so as to appear invisible to them.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DouglasAdams">Douglas Adams</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DirkGentlysHolisticDetectiveAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DirkGentlysHolisticDetectiveAgency">Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</a></em> features a man at a university with a very long nose. He never speaks, and is never spoken to because people are too startled by the sight of his nose, and don't want to bring it up. He also constantly taps his fingers and makes other odd gestures, and nobody asks why due to their reluctance to speak to him. Finally one character ends up addressing him after accidentally knocking on his door. The man stops twitching and calmly announces that nobody has spoken to him in almost two decades (quoting the exact time to the second). Apparently all the gestures were him counting the seconds.
<ul><li> The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLongDarkTeaTimeOfTheSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLongDarkTeaTimeOfTheSoul">The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul</a></em> features the Norse god Thor. He complains to the female protagonist, Kate Schecter, that even though gods walk among humans, no one notices them.
<div class="indent"><strong>Thor:</strong> If I walk along one of your streets in this... world you have made for yourselves without us, then barely an eye will once flicker in my direction. <br/><strong>Kate:</strong> Is this when you're wearing the helmet? <br/><strong>Thor:</strong> Especially when I'm wearing the helmet!
</div></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels, one of the Canting Crew is a beggar named Duck Man, for the very simple reason that he has a duck on his head. Most people don't mention the duck out of politeness, and those who <em>do</em> bring it up will be met with the response "What duck?" It's mentioned that he used to be quite normal "before everyone else started seeing ducks".
<ul><li> Another member of the Canting Crew is Altogether Andrews, who has several split personalities, none of which is named Andrews. This is never brought up.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, Shawn Ogg's parentage is this. His father is publicly accepted to be Sobriety Ogg. The only problem with this idea is that Sobriety Ogg died some ten years before Shawn was born. Most people avoid the issue (probably out of fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Nanny</a>) and are quick to silence outsiders who try to mention it.
</li><li> Death himself is visible to all inhabitants of the Discworld, but he is so frightening in his appearance that most people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">unconsciously choose not to notice anything strange about him</a> to preserve their sanity, even when having a conversation with him.
</li><li> Dwarves don't identify themselves as male or female and never even discuss in public that there are female dwarves. When the more progressive Ankh-Morpork dwarves start ignoring this taboo, it takes multiple books to avoid a civil war. It's mentioned that mating rituals among dwarves mostly involve attempting to surreptitiously verify what sex the other dwarf is.
</li><li> There's also the Librarian of Unseen University, who is an orangutan due to a magical accident. People found it odd at first but now barely think about it. It's been said that if someone told the staff that there was an ape on campus they'd go ask the Librarian if he'd seen it.
</li><li> It does come up with people outside the university - they have no idea how anyone can understand what the librarian is saying ("oook." vs "oook?"), and the wizards reply they've never had an issue.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> series, Dragaerans who are the offspring of two or more Houses are the objects of prejudice, pity, or mistrust by the vast majority of the Empire's nobility, who regard such inter-House miscegenation with contempt and disgust. Yet nobody <em>ever</em> mentions that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Sethra Lavode</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">older than the Houses</a>, so she's not a pureblooded member of any House.
<ul><li> Most contemporary people don't <em>know</em> how old she is; she's currently a somewhat mythical figure. And as the Houses antedate the bloodlines (they're mostly a recognition of the wildly varying species which were all engineered into biologically similar and interfertile Dragaerans), Sethra comes closer to being pureblooded than the current generations. Whether she shares a bloodline with House Dzur or one of the tribes which died out before the Empire is unclear; she herself simply doesn't seem to care (or seem willing to share; effectively the same thing).

The actual nature of the operation he's pressing, however, and the reason for it are conspicuously never mentioned.

This renders Slartibartfast's spaceship, which is described as resembling an Italian bistro with fins and engines, invisible to bystanders.
<ul><li> It's perfectly visible to whomever the "Somebody Else" in question is, however; in this case, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfazedEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfazedEveryman">Arthur Dent</a>.

Neither is the fact that Fenwick and Duraugh are the only surviving of eight children, and that's because they were sent away to foster care. The protagonist, Ward, thinks about this, but no one says it. It remains unclear whether the other children died because the grandfather was abusive, too, or whether it's the family curse. Maybe both. Likewise, no one ever talks about the adultery that Fenwick and his father committed, the bastards are euphemistically called "cousins", although everyone knows what they really are. Ward has his blind spots, too - he complains that his mother was never able to protect him, but the fact that his beloved aunt Stala, who was a lot stronger, both mentally and physically, didn't protect him either, is not mentioned. And uncle Duraugh also gets off scot-free, even though he spent a lot of time on the Hurog estate, and acted like best buddies with his jerkass brother.

They knew that she was with him, and that he was raping her, but they sat back and did nothing. Roarke tells Eve that he intends to hunt them down and make them pay for this. Eve wants him to leave it alone. So they try to ignore it and focus on other matters. Later, he brings it up, and Eve can only think "Here it was. The big glowing elephant in the room that she hoped to ignore. And it was trumpeting."
</li><li> A more serious example can be found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InvisibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InvisibleMan">Invisible Man</a></em>, in which characters do their very best not to bring up the subject of race relations.

</li><li> A fairly common interpretation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>'s actions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeMorteDarthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeMorteDarthur">Le Morte d'Arthur</a></em> is that he knows that Lancelot is sleeping with Guinevere, or has at least heard the rumors, but refuses to address the issue because he knows the damage it will cause. The rest of the court seems similarly inclined, because even while they circulate rumors they never address the king with their suspicions. At least not until Agravain decides he wants more space in the room.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing">The Once and Future King</a></em> is more explicit about King Arthur knowing about the affair but staying silent. There are some very good scenes with the three of them carefully not mentioning it.
</li><li> The alternative theory (which the RSC theatrical adaptation implies) is that he's become so oblivious to Guinevere as a person he barely notices what she's doing most of the time.
</li><li> Later in the final book, Arthur is actually said to be willing to forgive Lancelot for all of this, but Gawaine won't let him because Lancelot <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> accidentally killed Gareth</span>.

All that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent">Chiron</a> is willing to say is that it's a "metaphysical" debate and that the existence of the Olympians is a "much smaller matter". The implication is that even the Olympians are just as clueless as mortals are regarding whether there is an all-powerful being above them or not.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard">Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard</a></em> is a bit braver by introducing Samirah al Abbas, who worships God over the Norse gods (as a Muslim, she views them as simply genies). However, the matter is still inconclusive since Sam basically veers into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a>: she refuses to worship the gods despite fully understanding that they have godlike powers. When Magnus (a self-described atheist) asks her about this, Sam says that it reinforces her belief in God even more, as, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">unlike the Norse gods</a>, He doesn't make Himself known to mortals and never try to interfere with their lives.

If you see something with your own eyes, something that should not exist according to Munsell, then you just pretend you didn't see it. If you absolutely must refer to it (say, to warn others about speaking of it) then you call it "apocryphal". The town of East Carmine has an apocryphal man. He regularly steals food from others' houses in broad daylight, and no one will stop him for fear of breaking the rules by acknowledging his existence.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShamanBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShamanBlues">Shaman Blues</a></em>, the spirits following Gardiasz seem to have this status. They never speak, Witkacy has no idea who they are and why they're following the lord of the afterlife, and the one time he asked, his relations with Gardiasz soured permanently.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, the incest between Cersei and Jaime is this trope after King Robert's death. Initially, it was known only to a few people who had spies or performed some research (Varys, Littlefinger, Renly, Stannis, and Jon Arryn). However, after the end of the first book where the Lannisters have performed a coup and killed Robert and Ned, Stannis sends letters all across Westeros with the news of incest. While the fact is known to even the Lannisters' allies, it's something that can't be discussed because the reveal of the incest would result in the whole reign of Joffrey (and later Tommen) being considered illegitimate and treasonous.

This comes to a head at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, which proves to be the catalyst of the war when the Templar order in the city (which has begun ruling it with an iron fist by making mages Tranquil for the slightest of reasons or no reason at all or other such things <em>despite it being illegal under Chantry law</em>) fails to prevent an uprising and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> (pun intended) commander declares a Right of Annulment (basically "kill every mage in the place") over the actions of one mage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedRetribution">that she knew to be an apostate who was never a member of Kirkwall's Circle</a>.

Perhaps to deliberately invoke this trope, she <em>never</em> talks about her body in her videos, and the interviews she's done gloss over it as well.

Everyone involved denies this, saying the split was amicable, with Arin explaining that they didn't bring Jon up so much because they were trying to respect his desire to form his own identity separate from his work on <em>Game Grumps</em>.
<ul><li> This whole controversy has been referenced a couple of times on the show, most often by Danny himself. During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> playthrough, he says he's aware of the conspiracy theories, but they never bothered him because they're completely untrue.

</li><li> Timmy never makes any sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">world-benefitting wish,</a> like no discrimination (the closest he got to doing that was wishing everyone was the same, but that didn't change people's attitudes like he had hoped), world peace, a cure for cancer, etc. While this could be justified in that he's a self-centered 10-year-old child and when he grows up all remnants of his fairies' magic will disappear unless he keeps the mindset of a child, it seems implausible that he never thought to wish for something like this not even <em>once</em>. In the live-action movies which take place in a possible future, Timmy can only make selfless wishes, and even if he does, there <em>is</em> a limit to how far he can go with them.
</li><li> Even the more good-natured Chloe doesn't consider making such wishes, even though she does occasionally make world-benefitting wishes on a much smaller scale.

Lois insists that Peter should go see a doctor, but Peter says that it would be better not to talk about it, "just like we do with the squid." The camera pulls back to reveal an actual giant squid at the table, who knocks various objects to the floor; Peter and Lois make excuses.

The problem is that these revelations cause her brother and parents to start fighting endlessly with one another, prompting Meg to realize that she needs to be the target of the family's derision to keep them all alive.

</li><li> In April 1967, Ron Jones, a history teacher at Cubberley <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchool">High School</a> in Palo Alto, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/California">California</a>, found himself struggling to explain to his class how the German people could have fallen behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">the Nazis</a> so easily. So he decided to show them personally, creating a student movement called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Wave_(experiment)">the Third Wave<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (after the common belief that the third in a series of waves is the last and largest). The movement emphasized conformity and the greater good, treating democracy and individualism as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad">the downfall</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill">of civilization</a>. Jones started with things like drilling his class in proper seating and posture, before moving on to discipline, salutes (which conspicuously resembled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">the Nazi salute</a>), and the transformation of himself into an authoritative figure. By the end of day three, over two hundred students had been recruited, membership cards were being given out, banners were flying, and Third Wave members were telling Jones when others were violating the rules — all completely unexpected developments. Realizing that he was losing control of the Third Wave, Jones decided to end it. On day four, he announced that the Third Wave was actually part of a nationwide youth movement, and that tomorrow at noon, an assembly would be held in which the movement's national leader and presidential candidate would be revealed on television. At the assembly, the students were met only with an empty channel. Jones revealed a few minutes later that the entire Third Wave was an experiment in how fascism can so easily claim the hearts and minds of the masses (even those who had sworn "it can't happen here"), and played a film about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>. It's said that after everything occurred, it was so scarring that no one at the school even talked about it for three years, as the students realized that they had willingly gone along with ideologies similar to the Nazis with very little prompting. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWave">The Wave</a></em> details everything that was going on, with only slight exaggerations made to actual student behavior.
</li><li> The Ryugyong Hotel was possibly the most literal example of this trope. Made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NorthKorea">North Korea</a>, it was said when it was completed it would be the largest hotel in the world. However, after spending an obscene amount of money on it (2% of the nation's entire GDP) construction stopped and the government pretended it didn't exist, even though it dominates the <a class="urllink" href="http://obviousmag.org/archives/uploads/2009/09092901_blog.uncovering.org_ryugyong.jpg">skyline of the city<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Construction has been picked up by an Egyptian company who wants to make it the first cell tower in the nation, now they happily talk about the achievement it will be.
</li><li> A "<a class="urllink" href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/missing-stair.html">missing stair<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" refers to an abuser who gets away with their actions when other people who live with the abuser know how to avoid the abuse, while also having to instruct new people who enter into the situation on how to prevent it from happening to them. The metaphor refers to a missing stair in a house's staircase; everyone who lives there knows how to avoid the missing stair, but they also have to instruct guests in the house on how to avoid falling when the guest comes in. The term thus suggests that long-term abuse occurs when people would rather work around the abuser than confront them.
<ul><li> The original context of the above-cited blog post is <a class="urllink" href="http://pervocracy.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/scene-is-not-safe.html">regarding abuse in kink communities<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. No one wants to admit that sometimes, the negative stereotypes regarding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BDSM">BDSM</a> as an excuse for abusive behaviour can be true in specific cases. So people become reluctant to name and shame abusers, or kick them out of the community; instead, people will simply be advised that (for instance) John once added things to a scene that the submissive hadn't agreed to, or that Mary got convicted of rape that one time. If bad things then happen relating to John and Mary, well, no one could say they weren't warned. John and Mary continue to have access to new victims (who may or may not actually know about the missing stair in advance), while everyone else allows abusers into their shared spaces. The obvious solution would be to prevent John and Mary from coming back, but that would bring up the point that everyone else let John and Mary go on doing terrible things to people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkCostFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SunkCostFallacy">and they don't want to admit that they wasted all that time</a>.
<div class="indent">Tons of people, including several in the leadership, instantly knew who I meant. The reaction wasn't "there's a rapist among us!?!" but "oh hey, I bet you're talking about our local rapist."
</div></li><li> Other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> examples in recent memory include the Catholic Church's massive coverup of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PedophilePriest">child molestation</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>'s neglectful attitude toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile">Jimmy Savile</a>'s horrific sexual offences. Predictably, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/12/25/a-famous-porn-star-claims-she-was-raped-on-set-will-she-receive-justice.html">this issue also exists<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pornography" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pornography">pornography</a> industry. Corey Feldman of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoonies">The Goonies</a></em> fame has likewise <a class="urllink" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/08/business/la-fi-ct-hollywood-molesters-20120109">spoken<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/corey-feldman-pedophilia-problem-child-actors-contributed-demise/story?id=14256781">about<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the phenomenon in Hollywood, and he in turn faced criticism from his late costar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoreyHaim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoreyHaim">Corey Haim</a>, who accused Feldman himself of letting an adult molest Haim. Then in 2017, a slew of accusations against <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein">Harvey Weinstein<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (co-founder of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiramaxFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MiramaxFilms">Miramax Films</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheWeinsteinCompany">The Weinstein Company</a>) set off a chain reaction dubbed the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinstein_effect">Weinstein effect<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, emboldening survivors of sexual violence to come forward with similar allegations against <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too_(hashtag)#Aftermath">countless prominent men<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and expose the figurative elephants.

</li><li> For nearly a decade after the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> in 2009, the lingering question of whether or not he molested children was largely ignored by the media and general public. Indeed, posthumous projects spearheaded by Jackson'ss estate include such family-friendly projects as two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MichaelJacksonONE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MichaelJacksonONE">Cirque du</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MichaelJacksonTheImmortalWorldTour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MichaelJacksonTheImmortalWorldTour">Soleil</a> tribute shows and a 2017 animated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenSpecial">Halloween Special</a>. This elephant, however, would trumpet its trunk with a vengeance in January of 2019, when the documentary <em>Leaving Neverland</em> publicized new accusations against Jackson that spawned a much bigger public and media backlash than even the first accusation in 1993, to the point where Jackson was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">Unpersoned</a> in a few places — his music was dropped from several Canadian and New Zealand radio stations, and his appearance on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, "Stark Raving Dad", became the show's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingEpisode">Missing Episode</a>. However, due in part to the efforts of his estate (which has sued HBO over the documentary and pushed new projects involving his work, such as a biopic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JukeboxMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JukeboxMusical">Jukebox Musical</a>, into development/production) and the massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a> surrounding Jackson, he and his work remain popular.
</li></ul></li><li> In 1937, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar">Spanish Civil War</a>, many of the European powers met in Nyon, Switzerland to discuss a growing problem of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubmarinePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubmarinePirates">Submarine Pirates</a> and what to do about it. What nobody was willing to outright say was that the Italian Navy (in support of the Nationalists) was carrying out unrestricted submarine warfare against shipping from nations supporting the Republicans. Such attacks were an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar">act of war</a>, and nobody was yet ready to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">the war that this would light off</a>, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">all of the horrors of what happened last time</a> were still fresh in their minds.
