</p><p>These (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">usually female</a>) characters are obsessed with dieting in order to reach the ideal; commenting on their figure is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">a sensitive point</a> for them. However, not all characters with Weight Woe are overweight; many are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">Hollywood Pudgy</a>, and some are even told in-verse that they don't need to diet at all.
</p><p>Sometimes this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DietEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DietEpisode">a one-episode affair</a>, usually because someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreFat">brings their weight up</a> or they want to impress their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, but just as often it is a character quirk. In the latter case, the character is usually a yo-yo dieter or has too little willpower to keep it up so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">nothing about their figure changes</a>.

Media often dictates that one must be thin in order to be attractive, sometimes unrealistically so. However, eating disorders are more complicated than that, involving many factors ranging from feelings of lack of control to loneliness to inadequacy in other ways. Eating disorders can contribute to fatality if they go untreated.
</p><p>In fiction, however, Weight Woe is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, most likely because of its sensitive nature and prevalence in real life. Even in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a> they are portrayed as easily treatable, with the sufferer getting over them by the end of the episode when in truth recovery can take months or years. Additionally, the cause is almost always solely to do with a character's physical appearance, whether the issue is genuine or perceived.

</div><ul><li> At another point in the same episode, Luna simply advises that Usagi should avoid overeating or eating junk food and that she'll get plenty of excersize just by being Sailor Moon. However, Usagi notices Luna is drawing something on a sheet of paper. Luna reveals a drawing of an extremely overweight Sailor Moon, saying it's future Usagi.
</li></ul></li><li> This is occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in Chibi-Usa's side stories, usually in regards to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">Sweet Tooth</a>. One such story told of two celestial lovers who were pretty much barred from being together because they didn't focus on their heavenly duties. The wife ended up alleviating her boredom by snacking and watching TV, resulting in her gaining weight. This coupled with her rather plain face caused her to worry that her husband was cheating on her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He wasn't and shows up to conclude that skinny girls are best for dating, but strong women are the ones for marrying.</span>
</li><li> In another side story, it's mentioned that Ikuko is putting Kenji on a diet because he put on a little weight.
</li><li> In an episode of SuperS, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> traps Sailor Moon in a tutu that forces her to dance endlessly. However, Sailor Moon's gut causes the tutu to break, allowing her to finish the monster off. Tuxedo Mask says he feels like advising Sailor Moon to drop some weight, but it ended up helping her this time.

The only people known to have completely escaped it are Artemis (a rather hyperactive <em>alien cat</em>), Wakagi (a cop that hates sweets, and Debrine's plan was based on chocolate) and Hikaru (who <em>didn't even notice</em>, as she always eats healthy foods), while Minako, upon being informed she was getting fat, trained so much she not only missed Valentine but lost the weight in a few days and then regained it in <em>muscles</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Natsumi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> sometimes fusses over her weight. This even drove the plot of one chapter in the manga.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors">Pet Shop of Horrors</a></em> had a story called <em>Diet</em> which dealt with three people and their personal struggles concerning their weight; a chubby young girl who wanted to slim down to get her boyfriend back before a school dance, a boxer who is trying to keep his weight down before his next match, and a model whose colleague visited Count D's shop for a miracle diet pill.
<ul><li> The girl receives a personal trainer who helps her lose the weight for the dance, but in doing so, the girl has come to take pride in herself with a new sense of self-confidence, and realizes that her ex-boyfriend is a total ass.

</li><li> The boxer receives a parakeet that constantly tries to get him to eat or drink something while training, which the boxer considers as a form of motivation. He loses his next match but is grateful that he gave it his all and decides to retire.

<ul><li> Being about a chubby heroine finding love, it's no surprise that this trope would be played with. It's largely averted with the main character of Tsumugi. Despite growing up teased about her weight and coming to think no one would ever love her, Mugi decided she had love herself first and foremost. It was this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatAndProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatAndProud">Fat and Proud</a> attitude that attracted her first boyfriend Tagami, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChubbyChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChubbyChaser">Chubby Chaser</a> who is attracted to her confidence as much as her appearance. Since then the only time we have seen her worry about weight is an early chapter where she had overeaten to the point she was literally bursting out of her clothes. Even then she only focused on dieting enough to drop the unwanted excess.
</li><li> Akane Itou, a character introduced later, is a much straighter case. She has many of the same woes as Mugi used to but has not yet had the same "love yourself" epiphany as Mugi did. Mugi takes Akane under her wing with the promise of helping her find that self-love for herself. Since Akane <em>doesn't</em> want to feel fat, this takes the form of helping her with diet and exercise, hoping that the two of them together could do what one alone could not.

Tomoko is so hurt by this she starves herself out of desperation to become beautiful. One night her mother finds her sitting in front of the open fridge, content to just look at the food but never eating it. Sometime later, Tomoko discovers that she's become slender and attractive and decides to speak to her old crush. The jackass doesn't even recognize her as the girl he called a whale and they start to make out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At that point, Tomoko is so overcome with hunger, she <em>bites off the guy's face</em> and starts eating him.

While waiting for a bridge to be repaired, Zorori and the boar twins take up residence in an old castle. The castle comes with a robotic cat maid capable of cooking large and exquisite meals. When Zorori tries to tell her she doesn't need to cook so much the maid bursts into hysterical tears, so not wanting to upset her, Zorori, Ishishi, and Noshishi eat everything she makes. A few days pass, and all three have become very large and very fat, so much so that they aren't allowed to cross the repaired bridge because they might break it. Zorori finally takes matters into his own hands and has to reprogram the maid so she won't have any more crying fits... of course, Zorori and the twins are still fat and have to work off the excess weight the slow way.
</li><li> <em>IC In A Doll</em>:
<ul><li> One chapter focuses on Hanako, an award-winning author suffering from extreme bulimia. In her adolescence, Hanako was repeatedly molested by her stepfather and makes herself vomit to stay thin in order to wear clothes for younger women to give herself a second childhood. Her maid doll, Cherry, silently stood by and only laid out towels whenever Hanako prepared to purge, but Cherry goes against her orders and tries to stop Hanako when she has a nervous breakdown. The final chapter of the series shows a much healthier and happier Hanako preparing to get married.
</li><li> The first chapter in the series focused on the relationship being a nameless boy doll and a rich woman named Kaya. When Kaya was younger, she was also bulimic like Hanako.

But according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, he's gaining <em>muscle</em> rather than fat.

Her team helps her out once she confesses her worries to them, though she's reminded to focus on building muscle instead of just getting smaller. As the series progresses, it focuses more on her getting physically stronger and doing strength training to prepare for her high-level races.
</li><li> This downplayed (and discussed) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> with Sakura (and Ino) mentioning that she was on a diet to make herself pretty enough to win Sasuke.

</li><li> As combat sports have weight classes, this is a recurring plot point in series dedicated to them. Some examples:
<ul><li> Often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AshitaNoJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AshitaNoJoe">Ashita no Joe</a></em> due to various boxers finding serious trouble at staying in their preferred weight class:
<ul><li> Nishi is a natural heavyweight (weighing over 200 lbs at his licence exam), but the scarce number of heavyweight boxers in Japan pushes Danpei to put him on a diet for a middleweight-meaning he has to slim down to 160 lbs <em>at most</em>. Needless to say, he has <em>immense</em> trouble, and for a while, he would sneak out of the gym to eat more.
</li><li> Joe and Rikiishi had all but promised themselves to have a professional bout... But the former was a natural flyweight (up to 112 lbs) fighting as a bantam (between 115 and 118 lbs) specifically to work his way up to Rikiishi's class, and the latter a welter (between 140 and 147 lbs) that, to work his way <em>down</em> to Joe's class, was fighting as a featherweight (at the time between 118 and 126 lbs)-prompting Rikiishi to take a nightmarish diet to get in the bantamweight limits before Joe can get too fat. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It plays a part in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualtyInTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualtyInTheRing">Rikiishi getting killed by Joe</a>, as the toll taken by the diet means his body cannot survive long enough for him to be brought to the hospital and possibly healed after one of Joe's punches caused him a brain hemorrage</span>.
</li><li> Later in his career, Joe gets a late growth spurt that makes it hard for him to stay in the <em>featherweight</em> class, when, out of respect for Rikiishi and Carlos Rivera, he's planning to take on Jose Mendoza, the bantamweight world champion. With great hardship, Joe manages to stabilize himself at exactly 118 lbs, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it may have played a part in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">his death by exhaustion</a> against Mendoza</span>.
</li><li> Averted with Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation bantamweight champion Kim Yongbi, who not only has no problem staying at exactly 117 lbs and half, he just <em>cannot put more weight</em> due <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the shock from when, during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a>, he discovered that the soldier he had killed to steal his food and survive a few days more was his father, who had deserted to bring him that food</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is one of the main driving points of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePoundGospel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePoundGospel">One Pound Gospel</a></em>. Kosaku Takahara is an incredibly talented boxer... who is also an incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">big eater</a>. He has very little control over his appetite and as such he keeps switching weight classes. He goes through multiple crash diets as a result of this since his coach is trying to keep him in one weight class, and he's been disqualified a couple of times due to vomiting in the middle of his matches.
<ul><li> Amusingly enough, a rival boxer named Matsuzaka has the opposite problem: after Kosaku passed his license exam by knocking him out with one punch, Matsuzaka trained to have his revenge, but every time he was about to issue his challenge he'd find out Kosaku had got in a higher weight class. When he <em>finally</em> got around to challenge him he instinctively threatened Kosaku when he heard him considering switching weight class again, as he couldn't get any heavier... And on the ring, differently from Kosaku, he's visibly pudgy (for non-heavyweights, a whale).
</li></ul></li><li> Not as important as in the previous examples but still featured in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AllRounderMeguru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AllRounderMeguru">All Rounder Meguru</a></em>: while Meguru doesn't have much trouble with his diet, at least one fighter was disqualified from the Kanto Amateur Shooto Championship for failing at the weigh-in (allowing Meguru to enter in his place, as he had been admitted as a reserve only), and Maki is quite creepy as she savors the incoming release day, the one day of the week she doesn't have to be on a diet.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em>, Haruyuki Arita is an overweight boy who has severe self-esteem problems that, among other things, are related to his weight. In the second OVA, Haru's weight means that he's in danger of possibly being forced to attend a special health session, which would prevent him from participating in the territory battles.
</li><li> The central conflict of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HowHeavyAreTheDumbbellsYouLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HowHeavyAreTheDumbbellsYouLift">How Heavy Are the Dumbbells You Lift?</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> Sakura Hibiki trying to lose weight by exercising properly after getting teased about her weight one day (despite the fact that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">only slightly soft rather than outright fat</a>). The manga has proper (albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a> laden) exercise techniques <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">once per chapter.</a>
</li><li> Owing to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat">Formerly Fat</a> past, Hime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WastefulDaysOfHighSchoolGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WastefulDaysOfHighSchoolGirls">Wasteful Days of High School Girls</a></em> is extremely sensitive about high-calorie foodstuff and exercises religiously to, as she puts it, "stay thin despite pigging out".
</li><li> Fujiwara starts trying to lose weight over winter break in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>. The fact that she applies very loose logic to her eating habits like "cold foods don't have calories because calories are a measurement of heat" and "eating lots of spicy food is the same thing as exercise because both make you sweat" doesn't really help.
</li><li> Mari is the only cast member of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove">Asteroid in Love</a></em> who is anxious about her weight; this is apparent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSpringsEpisode">Chapter 6</a> as she forgoes dinner since she noticed she has put up a few pounds. Sakura thinks it's her breast than anything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LapisReLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LapisReLights">Lapis Re:LiGHTs</a></em> has Millefeuille of supernova.

One has to imagine that her frequently having to perform in public in revealing outfits doesn't help.

<ul><li> Fred Andrews, father of the title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie</a></em>, is perpetually dieting and cheating on his diet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a></em> Blue Beetle grappled with weight gain and a heart condition for a while. His diet was going very poorly until his doctor got the idea to use Ted's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">Manchild</a> tendencies to their advantage, by pitting him against someone <em>else</em> who was also on a diet and making him see it as a competition. That person happened to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a> (during her "diet root beer" phase) and Ted managed to develop the willpower to slim back down for good for the sake of rubbing it in Karen's face.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the Silver Age, Matter-Eater Lad once got hit by a ray gun which altered his alien metabolism. As a Bismollian he can consume any form of matter and his metabolism processes it rather quickly. However, the ray had slowed it down to that of a normal human, which caused his body to swell up after he devoured a ton of dirt to form an escape tunnel. He was stuck like this for a while until a doctor managed to undo the ray's effect.
</li><li> Conversely, Bouncing Boy once lost his power to inflate into a ball-like form and became so slim his teammates didn't recognize him. Rather than worrying about his looks, Bouncing Boy was sad that he couldn't be in the Legion anymore without a power. His powers were eventually restored. He'd lose them again a few times afterwards, but during those times his weight wasn't affected at all.
</li><li> Lightning Lad in the comic tie-in to the Legion cartoon once had his powers swapped with Bouncing Boy due to an alien virus, causing himself to get fat in the process. The end of the issue implied Garth was going to be stuck like that longer than his teammates because the virus lasts longer on people with greater mass.
</li><li> During the Five Years Later era, Cera Kesh tried to join the young Legionnaires only to be mocked for her bad skin and weight by Live Wire, who called her a cow, and Inferno. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">Hollywood Pudgy</a> comes into play because Cera wasn't even that chubby. When Cera became the new Emerald Empress, she briefly used the Emerald Eye to exact some revenge on Inferno by giving him zits and making him fat, so he would know what it's like to be "a cow." It should be noted that the two aforementioned Legionnaires were the only ones who had a problem with Cera's looks, and the rest of the team were very disappointed by their bullying.
</li><li> Averted with Five Years Later Dream Girl, who indeed put on some weight since she left the Legion and became High Seer of Naltor, but became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">Big Beautiful Woman</a> instead of lamenting her size.
</li><li> A more subdued version of this trope occurred during "Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes" arc. The majority of the Legion who were still present in the 31st Century after the Justice League of Earth drove them underground were featured with redesigns by artist Gary Frank. In Frank's notes, it's mentioned the Legionnaires were purposefully drawn with a certain amount of gauntness, even in the ones who still looked muscular, in their builds (most noticeable in their faces), a likely indicator that many of them lost weight from lack of sleep and being unable to eat properly while on the run.
</li></ul></li><li> A certain running gag pertaining to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> Family during the Silver Age had most of the characters getting fat one way or another. This includes Superman, his younger self Superboy on <em>four</em> separate occasions (including most of Smallville save for Jonathan and Martha Kent on two of those occasions), Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Supergirl in her secret identity as Linda Lee.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Peter Parker</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, and Jean Grey all let themselves go in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EarthX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EarthX">Earth X</a></em>. Peter as a result of retiring from superheroics and the police force, and Logan and Jean (in that world married) as a result of retirement and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife">Awful Wedded Life</a>. Logan even smugly stated he couldn't get fat because of his healing factor. Peter went back to being Spider-Man and started to lose weight near the end of the first Earth-X book though, though a few people snarked about him being bitten by a "radioactive spare tire" due to his badly fitting costume.
</li><li> In an issue of the second volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Titans</a></em>, Raven discovered she had six evil brothers with powers corresponding to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins">Seven Deadly Sins</a>, and her evil side manifested as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>. After taking down her brothers, she planned to transfer their powers to her teammates using Beast Boy as the transference catalyst (which would've killed him). Roy Harper was briefly turned into the conduit for Gluttony and became fat, though this was immediately reversed when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> Raven implemented stopped her evil side. This appeared to have been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a> reference to Roy's thrill-seeking womanizing tendencies, and his history as a recovered drug addict rather than any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> tendencies. So this worked to tie in the stereotypical association of fat people with gluttony and the sin's actual nature as excessive over-consumption.
</li><li> This is just one of the many insecurities that plague the titular heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered">Empowered</a>.</em> She's not really overweight (apart from a naturally big butt, although she's the only one who considers this a problem) but because her super suit is skin tight to the point that she can't even wear underwear, she's very insecure about her looks. She admits to starving herself and exercising constantly.

Jokey led the others in a series of pranks tricking her into believing she was overweight. After Papa finds out, he gives her the makeover to help restore her confidence.
</li><li> Just as its cartoon namesake has done a few stories about this trope, so has <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSimpsons">Simpsons Comics</a></em> tackled it a few times.
<ul><li> In one issue, the heftier townspeople of Springfield are ordered to lose a set number of pounds by Rainer Wolfcastle and the President of the United States. If they can, everyone gets treated to an all-expenses-paid vacation at a water park. Everyone is able to lose the amount of weight required, except for Homer who gains three pounds and has to work even harder after the town labels him a pariah.
</li><li> In another, Mr. Burns tries to cut costs by giving his workers highly addictive and delicious donuts instead of pay. The plan works, although Homer and the other employees are starting to put on a couple of pounds. It's not until a month goes by that Burns has to stop making the donuts, as it's costing him millions and productivity has dropped significantly because his workers are too obese to get anything done.
</li><li> In another story, Nelson Muntz starts living with the Simpsons and spends a lot of his time making repairs around the house due to Homer's stupidity. As a result, he spends most of his time in school asleep. Without Nelson's bullying, the kids are able to use their lunch money to actually <em>buy</em> lunch, but because the cafeteria food is grossly unhealthy (they serve Cream of Lard), most of the student body becomes very overweight. Lisa's an exception because she brings a vegetarian lunch to school.
</li><li> In a summer special, Homer can't accompany the family on their vacation trip because he's too fat to be allowed on an airplane. He's given an alternative route on a flight company owned by Mr. Burns specifically for heavyset people, but the plane is in such a need of repairs Homer has to fix it himself. In his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">determination</a> to be with Marge and the kids, Homer ends up losing a lot of weight by accident through all the physical labor he employs. However, when he finally gets on the cruise the rest of the family is on, he's shocked to discover Marge and the kids have all gained weight. Without Homer's hijinks to keep them occupied, they had nothing to do but sit around and eat. Marge and the kids are then told that <em>they</em> are the ones too fat to fly home.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DialHForHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DialHForHero">Dial H for Hero</a></em> revamp <em>Dial H</em>, main character Nelson Jent is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFit">Formerly Fit</a> example whose life started going down the drain after he lost his job and his girlfriend. His friend Darren is concerned over the fact that Nelson had a heart attack and he's not even past 30.
</li><li> Swordsman was one of the few characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HeroesReborn">Heroes Reborn</a></em> who was left behind on the Counter-Earth. When he was seen again in the <em>Heroes Reborn: Remnants</em> story, he essentially became his world's version of Deadpool but got really fat in the process of binge-eating on junk food.
</li><li> <em>Common Grounds</em> #4 had a short story about a support group for superheroes struggling with their weight, with a Batman expy named Red Fox insisting they be called "density challenged" and suggesting they embrace their overweight status. It's pretty clear the guy is only suggesting this because of deep self-loathing with his body image, and the other members leave because they just want to lose weight.
</li><li> In the eight-issue to the comic tie-in of Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperheroSquadShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSuperheroSquadShow">The Superhero Squad Show</a></em>, most of the Squaddies had tried to retrieve an Infinity Fractal before the Blob could get it for Doctor Doom. But the Fractal activated and somehow made the Blob slender while making the Squaddies fat. The effect only lasted as long as Blob held onto the Fractal, which he did on Doctor Doom's orders to incapacitate the Squad. The story ended with the Squaddies attempting to utilize their new girth to stop crime before they turn back to normal. On the other end, the Blob was depressed that he'd gotten so small and finally dropped the Fractal because he wasn't comfortable with his thin body.
</li><li> Longtime member of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GlobalGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GlobalGuardians">Global Guardians</a></em> Rising Sun has not aged well by the time he appeared making things difficult for the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperYoungTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperYoungTeam">Super Young Team</a> after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em>.

</li><li> As an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>, Shaft of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood">Youngblood</a></em> apparently had an eating disorder during the team's first volume, and was very self-conscious about his weight. The seventh issue included a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareSequence">Nightmare Sequence</a> where he gorges himself and becomes obese. Strangely, this is one of the most original storylines created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobLiefeld">Rob Liefeld</a>, as it's virtually impossible to find comic books about male characters with eating disorders. This plot wasn't seen again in Shaft's later appearances.
</li><li> Two examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables">Fables</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mrs. Sprat, the wife of Jack Sprat, has a complex over being one of the few physically ugly women in a community of fairy tale princesses and queens because she's fat. And her sour personality makes her look even uglier because no one can stand to be around her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As of the hundredth issue, Mrs. Sprat joins the side of Mr. Dark, and gradually becomes thin, beautiful, and completely evil.</span>
</li><li> Jack Horner, in his spin-off comic, claims to have never been fat a day in his life. Which is why he's horrified when, in an issue appropriately titled "Fat Jack," he's suddenly sporting a large beer gut. Not only that, but he's also getting progressively uglier and losing his hair. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out Jack's obesity and ugliness are part of his transformation into a dragon, due to his years of hoarding an obscenely large treasure inside his magic briefcase.</span>

<div class="indent"><strong>Jon</strong>: Sensitive about our weight, are we? <br/><strong>Garfield</strong>: My weight, my business.
</div></li><li> The rarely seen "can't gain weight" variation shows up now and then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Foxtrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Foxtrot">Foxtrot</a></em>. Despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a>, Peter never gains any weight. Occasionally this becomes a source of annoyance for him because he's perpetually scrawny and unable to gain any muscle. Compare his father Roger who eats as much as he does, but actually shows it. Roger has no real problem with his weight, but his wife Andy will sometimes force him to go on a diet for his own good.

In another, Roseanne puts Dan on a diet after his heart attack, but his refusal to stick to eating healthier food leads to one of the worst fights the two have ever had, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> only it turns out Dan had already died from his heart attack in the series finale.</span> It's also been implied that Roseanne's weight, as well as her anger issues and her controlling nature with Dan, stems from her father's abusive nature and her mother's tendency to make everything better with food when she and Jackie were little girls.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun">3rd Rock from the Sun</a></em>, Dick begins stress eating as a result of his break-up with Mary in <em>Moby Dick</em>. He tries dieting and tries using a girdle, but upon learning Mary has also been stress eating, Dick decides to just buy bigger pants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> has dealt with this a couple of times. In "The Non-Fat Yogurt" Jerry, Elaine, and George discover that the supposed non-fat yogurt they've been enjoying every day actually contains fat and they've gained weight. Though this actually involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">Hollywood Pudgy</a> since none of them look any bigger. Even so, Kramer starts calling Jerry names like "chubs" and "tons-o-fun".
</li><li> Sylvia Fine is constantly dealing with this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em> though she has yet to curb her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> tendencies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Sabrina and the Beanstalk," Harvey finds himself in the clutches of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">Wicked Witch</a> atop the beanstalk Sabrina accidentally created. Said Witch serves him up food laced with an ingredient called "Fatten Up." By the time Sabrina gets to Harvey he's gotten pretty big, to the point that she uses him as a battering ram to get the Wicked Witch away from them. He manages to sweat the weight off as he climbs down the beanstalk... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and then Salem suffers from this after eating the entire "Fatten Up" container when it fell from the beanstalk.</span>
</li><li> One episode dealt with this as seriously as the show could. Sabrina tried to lose weight in order to fit into a dress for an upcoming dance but then started using shoddy diet drinks from the Other Realm. To make matters worse, the salesman put a spell on her bedroom mirror to make her reflection look morbidly obese. Zelda found out what happened when she saw her butt reflected much bigger than it was and took the spell off. Unfortunately, by that point, Sabrina legitimately believed she was huge and kept taking the diet shakes until she became invisible. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">wasted away into nothing</a>.
</li><li> In a later season episode, Hilda decides to screw with Morgan's fashion models by giving them free beverages and snacks at the coffee house and claiming they're fat-free. While they don't look any bigger, Morgan has to scramble to find new models for her show because the clothes don't fit them anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> had D.J. crash-dieting so she'd look good in a bathing suit for a pool party. As per usual, she was talked down by a heart-to-heart with her dad and a big hug. This episode gets a little slack in that D.J. <em>isn't</em> said to have an eating disorder—rather, the adults warn that crash dieting and overexercising could <em>lead</em> to one. It's still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>, but it didn't go so far as to outright say she developed and got over an eating disorder in a matter of days.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em> had this come up quite a few times in the show's run—which was somewhat realistic, considering that the main characters were middle-aged to elderly women, a group that (stereotypically) often tries to lose weight and diet:
<ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> episode (made of original clips) focused on the previous attempts at self-improvement the girls have gone through, including dieting. Sophia was actually trying to gain weight after learning she lost a pound, and one episode implies she was at least <em> heavier</em> when she was much younger. In the dieting episode, the girls all weighed themselves and poked fun at each other, which of course involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">Hollywood Pudgy</a> since none of them look heavyset. In Blanche's case, it would've helped if she had taken her high heels off <em>before</em> she got on the scale.
</li><li> A later episode dealt with Blanche dieting to fit into her wedding dress for her anniversary. She almost goes insane with hunger and practically assaults Rose when Rose accidentally eats Blanche's diet food. She does manage to fit into the dress... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> except the zipper on the back didn't fit. Rose takes a picture without Blanche knowing.</span>
</li><li> Blanche's estranged daughter Rebecca had put on a great deal of weight since the last time the two saw each other. Though Rebecca <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatAndProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatAndProud">admitted she was overweight</a> and didn't seem to care, she had also started dating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> named Jeremy who did nothing but insult her — even <em>as he was proposing marriage.</em> Dorothy was ready to beat the stuffing out of him, but Blanche kept holding back because she was afraid of Becky leaving her again. In the end, though, Blanche told Rebecca how she really felt, and Rebecca admitted that she was only planning to marry Jeremy because she feared that no one else would be interested. The intervention worked, and Blanche and Becky's relationship was gradually healed. In her next appearances, she was <em>much</em> slimmer, but she was also being played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">a different actress</a> in those appearances.

After having a vision of herself modeling clothes on a runway, Raven enters a fashion magazine's design contest by submitting a photo of herself in a dress she created. Though she wins the contest, the editor of the magazine severely edits the picture to make Raven look much thinner. When Raven takes her to task for this, the editor explains that Raven simply "doesn't have 'the look,'" and Raven responds that "This is the only look I have." In the end, Raven teams up with another model (who, though thin, points out that even <em>she</em> doesn't look like her photo-edited image in the magazine), each wearing a copy of the dress in the appropriate sizes. The audience loves it, and the editor ends up humiliated in front of everyone.

<ul><li> Two episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> have this theme:
<ul><li> In the Nickelodeon episode "Doug Tips The Scales", Doug gains weight while on vacation at his grandma's and tries to slim down before Beebee Bluff's pool party.
</li><li> In the Disney episode "Doug's Chubby Buddy," Patti Mayonnaise becomes obsessed with weight loss after she overhears Doug commenting on her weight (he was actually referring to a homemade vehicle he was making).
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>, Harold becomes insecure about his size and strives to lose weight when he overhears Sid and Stinky mocking him. He goes on a cruise with the purpose of helping kids lose weight, but is even <em>bigger</em> when he returns. He manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">lose the extra weight</a> with some help from Arnold, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> has one episode where Toot Braunstein attempts to lose weight, both through bulimia and anorexia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> have dealt with this trope in numerous ways due to the fact that a lot of the main characters are on the chunky side.
<ul><li> Lisa Simpson had an episode of this when some kids at school made fun of her weight.
</li><li> Homer bounces around this. Sometimes he wants to be thinner, but in "King-Size Homer" he had woe because he wanted to <em>gain</em> weight in order to qualify for a disability that would allow him to work from home.
<ul><li> "Brush With Greatness" and "King of the Hill" play Homer's attempts to lose weight straight. The former attempt is inspired by his getting stuck in a water slide and becoming a laughing-stock; the latter episode deals with him joining a gym and climbing a mountain to win Bart's respect after he embarrasses him at a church picnic field day.
</li></ul></li><li> Bart became overweight in "The Heartbroke Kid" after becoming addicted to the junk food in the new vending machines put into Springfield Elementary. To drive the point home they redid the opening with a now heavyset Bart, who ends up having a heart attack via malted milk ball-clogged arteries. Homer and Marge resort to having him sent to a fat camp against his will, though he finally sticks to losing the weight by himself after realizing his parents have had to turn the house into a youth hostel and degrade themselves for a bunch of annoying college students in order to pay for the camp.
</li><li> Rainer Wolfcastle has struggled with his weight on two occasions. The first time he claimed he was preparing for a fat secret agent role, but the second time he was at the same fat camp Bart was sent to.
</li><li> In a later season episode, Bart conspired to have Nelson Muntz addicted to Krusty Burger fast food in order to make him obese and lose the energy to bully Bart and the other kids. Lisa forced Bart to help Nelson lose the weight after seeing what Nelson turned into. The subplot started after Bart watched a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperSizeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperSizeMe">Super Size Me</a></em> parody, <em>Do You Want Lies With That?</em>
</li><li> "Sweets and Sour Marge" played with this trope by having Springfield named "America's Fattest Town" and the citizens are overjoyed by being famous for something. All except for Marge, who is slightly disturbed by how everyone seems to be celebrating their obesity. She strives to sue a sugar-manufacturing company out of protest for destroying the town's health, only to have <em>all</em> sugar banned from Springfield. Homer and Bart work to undo this because life without sugar is too much of a hell to comprehend, and although Homer pulls back for Marge's sake, the judge overturns his decision and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">things go back to normal</a>.
</li><li> In "Krusty Gets Kancelled," Bart and Lisa were shocked when they discover a morbidly obese Krusty in his apartment just as they were to announce that they got all of the celebrities (sans Elizabeth Taylor) needed for his comeback special. Krusty declared that he was on a steady diet of milkshakes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Lisa asked if they were diet milkshakes</a>. Luckily, the Simpson family <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingMontage">got him back in shape just in time</a>.
</li><li> In "Bart's Friend Falls In Love," Lisa is concerned about Homer's weight and worries that he might die as a morbidly obese blob. Marge tries to send away for a tape set to help Homer lose weight via suggestions in his sleep, but the company had run out of weight loss cassettes and sent in a set to improve a person's vocabulary. They don't realize Homer received the wrong tape, and while Homer becomes much more articulate he gains weight and destroys the tapes out of anger.
</li><li> Both sides of this are played with in "Hungry, Hungry Homer". Homer goes on a hunger strike to prove that the Springfield Isotopes are really being moved to Albuquerque and begins to waste away into a delirious state of mind. Meanwhile, the kids start to get fat from eating Homer's shares at dinner simply because Marge won't cook less, though this is more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalloonBelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalloonBelly">Balloon Belly</a> than permanent weight.
</li><li> In "Kamp Krusty" Martin Prince isn't happy that his parents are sending him to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatCamp">Fat Camp</a>, which is revealed to be run like a concentration camp by the sadistic camp counselor Mr. Black.
</li><li> "Bart Star" shows that Bart and a lot of Springfield's kids are out of shape, so their parents have them join the peewee football league to get more exercise. Bart doesn't really have a problem with being tubby, but Homer, of all people, has the nerve to call him "a disgrace to the family" for being fat.
</li><li> In "Guess Who's Coming To Criticize Dinner?" Homer's rave reviews as a food critic cause many Springfielders to gain weight. Among them is Mr. Burns, whose shins break due to his new girth. He's seen at the end, still fat, among the crowd ready to beat the crap out of Homer for all the shit he pulled in this episode.
</li><li> "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" had Homer leading an all-male entourage to the Super Bowl. With no women around, the guys can relax and let their bellies hang out. The moment they learn the bus driver's female, they're quick to pull themselves back together despite their annoyance.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Theodore and Eleanor</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a></em> sometimes become self-conscious about their weight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Arts and Crass" is centered around Daria and Jane creating a piece for the art competition about a girl with bulimia. The piece was meant to be supportive of people who didn't want to be judged for their looks and to get people to question the cost of beauty by the standards of society.
</li><li> Played straight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">Hollywood Pudgy</a> added in "Fat Like Me" when Sandi breaks her leg and is out of school for a few days. When she comes back to school, she's put on a couple of pounds and ends up having to resign from the Fashion Club due to the strict weight requirements <em>she</em> implemented. Quinn helps Sandi get back to her regular size because the Club was on the verge of falling apart without a steady leader.
</li><li> Reoccurring extra Mrs. Johannsen is a morbidly obese woman who suffers from hypoglycemia. In her first appearance in <em>Cafe Disaffecto</em>, she passes out while Daria and Jane are attempting to sell her chocolate for a school fundraiser. She insists on buying all their chocolate even though she tells them her doctor wouldn't approve. When she comes to, Daria states she can't sell her the chocolate out of fear for her health. She later appears in <em>Psycho Therapy</em> where it seems her weight and overeating stem from a traumatic childhood and feelings of abandonment after once being told she was an accident. When Quinn barges into her therapy session to talk to the cute therapist speaking with Johannsen, Quinn suggests vertical stripes will fix her problems.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> Stan became anorexic. While he is shown to be getting heavier during the course of the episode, this is really a delusion and he is finally shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkinAndBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkinAndBones">Nothing but Skin and Bones</a>. It's actually taken fairly seriously. On another end of the story, Stan devises a way to not eat with one method including giving his food to Klaus. Klaus eventually gets so big he bursts out of his fishbowl.
<ul><li> In another episode, Roger and Klaus have spent a year driving around the country to see the car pedometer get over 100,000, and have both gotten pretty fat from doing nothing and eating nothing but fast food. When the car breaks down, Roger tries to physically push it and has a heart attack. In the far future, Roger's shown trying this again (after what's implied to be numerous times and long after Klaus has died) and he's <em>much</em> more obese than he was before.
</li><li> One episode revealed Francine has to put a tremendous amount of effort into keeping her body tight, which includes powerlifting furniture and a diet of tea and laxatives. After realizing Stan only married her for her looks, she cuts off her exercise regime and gets a bit chunky (among other things).
</li><li> When put under the test of whose parenting skills are superior, Francine is allowed to raise Steve exclusively while Stan raises a clone called Steve-arino. Francine's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffParenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOffParenting">Hands-Off Parenting</a> for the sake of giving Steve space to learn from his mistakes turns him into a slovenly fat brat with bad hygiene. Naturally, Steve's extra chub makes it harder for him to get away from Steve-arino when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Steve-arino turns out to be a cat-torturing sociopath planning to murder Steve for emergency body parts.</span>
</li><li> While working as a newscaster in "Anchorfran", Francine's celebrity status gets her free meals whenever she wants at a Mexican restaurant. Stan starts exploiting this and puts on a lot of weight from constantly gorging himself on free food, even admitting he's been treating himself to 16 burritos a day. Stan remains fat for the rest of the episode, and while no one has any visible problem with this, Stan mentions all that spicy food <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> made his colon fall out, which he is apparently holding in place with <em>duct tape</em></span>. He's later seen shoving a sheet cake into his face and eating it like a dog.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Meg Griffin is shown to be an overeater and makes a habit out of throwing up after meals. She has far more issues than that, however. Stewie even tells her one time that she should consider becoming anorexic and bulimic like the female ballerina dancers since it "seems to work out for them".
</li><li> When the popular girls at school throw up, Meg says she loves to throw up to fit in.
</li><li> Brian's dumb ex-girlfriend Jillian is bulimic. Stewie calls her fat to make her throw up, and she makes comments about how she is losing her teeth.
</li><li> When Lois becomes a Hollywood starlet, she shows off her newfound anorexia by having her friends play her ribcage like a xylophone.
</li><li> In "Sibling Rivalry", Lois started to binge eat out of frustration after Peter lost his sex drive following a vasectomy. At first mocked about her weight, when the two accidentally have sex one night Peter is elated to discover "fat sex is the hottest sex" they ever had, and became determined to keep Lois heavy. By the end of the episode, Lois had a heart attack and received emergency liposuction.
</li><li> In "No Country Club for Old Men", Lois bakes a batch of brownies, eats them all herself, and then makes herself throw up. According to Stewie, this happens every time she makes brownies.
</li><li> Peter, Chris, and Stewie all dealt with weight issues in one single episode. Chris became self-conscious about his size, Peter got liposuction and plastic surgery to make himself a sculpted knockout, and Stewie became obese by way of mocking Chris' diet straight into an overeating disorder. Chris felt better about himself by the episode's end thanks to a few kind words from Meg, Peter gained back all his weight, and Stewie was inexplicably back to normal with no reason given.
</li><li> In "Girl, Internetted," Meg becomes an internet sensation when she starts posting videos (at Peter's behest) of her eating anything and everything she finds in the fridge. Alongside becoming obese, Meg becomes diabetic and has her feet removed. This isn't enough to make her stop what she's doing until she finds out everyone at her school has become morbidly obese in order to follow her example. The combined weight of all her newly fat classmates causes the school bleachers to collapse, killing one of the janitors whose feet are then transplanted to Meg's body.
</li></ul></li><li> Nitz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads">Undergrads</a></em> was horrified to discover he put on the Freshman Fifteen just before the Exposed Expo, an annual streaking event, and tried to slim down in time.
</li><li> Amy Wong of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> used to be fat when she was little, and although she slimmed down and became much more attractive as she got older, she still has a ravenous appetite which she keeps on lockdown. In one post-cancellation episode, Amy and Professor Farnsworth switched bodies, which Amy used as an excuse to go on an eating binge since it wasn't her body. However, the Professor's decrepit digestion system proved to be too much of a burden, and Amy switched with Leela. Amy's ravenous hunger caused Leela's body to become fat, and in order to stop herself from doing any more damage, Hermes volunteered to switch, claiming she couldn't possibly do any more damage to his flabby build. Both of them lost weight by the end of the episode, but in Amy's case, she'd lost her appetite completely after seeing Leela in the Professor's body graphically make out with Fry in Zoidberg's body.
<ul><li> During the second <em>Anthology Of Interest</em> episode, Bender wonders what it'd be like to be human. He quickly goes on a week-long hedonistic binge of sex, partying, and eating, culminating in his transformation into a thousand-pound human blob. And about forty of those pounds was his cholesterol level. The short ends with Bender dying at the beginning of a big party and no one realized this until 12 hours later.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR">Megas XLR</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatAndProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatAndProud">Fat and Proud</a> Coop is disgusted and enraged to discover his evil, alternate universe self is a power-hungry, <em>skinny</em> conqueror.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong">American Dragon: Jake Long</a></em> "Furious Jealousy", Jake's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> tendencies started to go into overdrive when he began slacking off due to a lack of magical incidents occurring in the vicinity and he started to get tubby. The only one who was originally concerned was Trixie until Jake's lack of exercise made him easy prey for the Gorgon sisters.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> episode had a villain creating girl scout cookies that were highly addictive and fattening as revenge for a childhood trauma of being booted out of the organization. Both Clover and Jerry became hooked on the cookies and became obese by the episode's end, as did the villain herself when the spies made her sample the "highly addictive sugar extract" she invented which made the cookies so addictive. An antidote was made and Clover and all the other victims of the scheme were turned back to normal.
<ul><li> While Clover learned to appreciate her regular size by episode's end (she was obsessed with buying a large hat), she hardly complained about her sudden weight gain during the mission.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em>, Bugs suggested to Porky during his brief stint as a caterer that he try some of his grandmother's old recipes since Porky's own dishes weren't that good. The recipes all call for an unhealthy amount of butter but are rather delicious, so much so that Bugs gets hooked on them and is finding excuses to throw parties just so Porky can cater them. Sure enough, Bugs starts off with a noticeable belly, then gets <em>huge</em>, to the point that he causes a tidal wave when jumping into a pool to save Daffy from drowning. That serves as Bugs' wake up call and he manages to cut back on the junk.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> when the writers did an intentionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a> episode about eating right after being told by the company that they had to make at least one Aesop episode. In "Grande Size Me" Ron tries to rally against Mr. Barkin's lectures on a balanced diet by eating Bueno Nacho every day to prove it's not dangerous. Sure enough, Ron starts to get tubby and pretty much everyone, including the villains, show concern over what Ron is doing to his body. However, after being submerged in a mutagenic growth formula, Ron's appetite increases, and he gradually becomes much fatter, taller, and more aggressive, until he finally mutates into an orange parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>. The only solution to reversing the mutation is to get him to eat healthy food. During the end credits, however, Ron delivers a lecture about not falling into strange chemicals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">to the audience</a> even though everyone else has no idea who he's talking to.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers">The Angry Beavers</a></em> at one point, where Dag is concerned that he's unable to gain weight for winter and worries about freezing to death, while Norb has got no problem at all. The episode ends with Dag deciding to spend the rest of winter living in morbidly obese Norb's fat folds.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em> Timmy once wished that every meal was dessert. At first, everyone is utterly hyperactive from the extra sugar rush, until a month passes by and everyone is so bloated they can only get around by rolling until the extra weight causes the Earth to fall out of orbit and spiral into the sun.
<ul><li> During <em>Timmy's Secret Wish</em>, after Timmy's retroactively stripped of his godparents for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> freezing time</span>, Jorgen Von Strangle starts binge eating frosting out of depression since he doesn't have Timmy's antics keeping him busy. He remains fat for the rest of the episode.
</li></ul></li><li> Bill Dauterive on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> is constantly ashamed of his weight ever since his life went downhill following his marriage and divorce. In one episode he's told his excess weight and body hair were the result of the government using him as a guinea pig in drug research until it turned out he was in the placebo group. He's ashamed to exercise in a gym because he thinks he's too fat to be seen working out with other people, and when he got diagnosed with diabetes he tried to blame his genes instead of his weight. In at least one episode that implies this has happened before, he goes on an eating binge when the Arlen town council bans food made with trans fats, thinking that all remaining junk food is good for him now that it's government approved. In a series of flashbacks, it shows Bill always goes overboard with what he thinks is diet food like light beer, failing to understand its diet compared to the regular product. In the trans fat episode, he becomes more bloated than he usually is and suffered from an outbreak of zits. He doesn't stop until Hank makes him look at his reflection, and Bill becomes horrified enough to stop.
</li><li> Hector in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OzzyAndDrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OzzyAndDrix">Ozzy &amp; Drix</a></em> almost had a heart attack after gaining a couple of pounds before he decided to go jogging.
</li><li> There was a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies">Home Movies</a></em> episode which revolved around Brendon and Jason enabling each other's poor eating habits, before the ending showed the now obese kids making fat-themed parodies of famous movies.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static</a> had traveled into the future, he was a little shocked to discover Richie had noticeably gained a few pounds as an adult. Upon arriving back to the present, he snarked that Richie should watch the fast food from that point.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVerySpecialEpisode">A Very Special Episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeverlyHillsTeens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeverlyHillsTeens">Beverly Hills Teens</a></em> had Tara go on a crash diet in order to drop five pounds so she would qualify to enter a particular beauty contest.
</li><li> Done twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KaBlam">KaBlam!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The overreaching story of one episode concerning Henry and June focused on the two being out-of-shape, to the point that they could barely get through the opening credits. They learn that a physical is coming up and try to lose weight with help from Richard Simmons, but they're not able to concentrate long enough to make any progress and sadly accept they'll be out of a job soon. Then they learn that their physical was only testing them on surviving cartoon physics via dumping anvils on them. Upon passing said exam, they go back to eating junk food with gusto.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ActionLeagueNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ActionLeagueNow">Action League NOW!</a> short was basically a reversal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thinner">Thinner</a></em> with the Chief getting cursed into obesity by a scam fortune teller with actual powers.
</li></ul></li><li> An <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> short called <em>Star Truck</em> had the Warners meeting a group of expies of the cast from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>. Wakko introduces the Scotty stand-in to Earth doughnuts, and he progressively gets fatter as the short goes on until he's too big to reach the control panels.
</li><li> Played with in two senses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo">Johnny Bravo</a></em>. In the earlier "Jumbo Johnny" episode, Johnny worries that he's not as buff as he could be and seeks to gain weight in terms of musculature. He's sold an experimental protein shake, but he doesn't follow the instructions correctly and drinks every can in a single night. By morning, Johnny is extremely fat and deludes himself into thinking he's ripped until he takes more of the protein shake and essentially becomes a fat giant. Johnny accidentally destroys most of the city looking for the protein shake salesman, who finally gives him the antidote to slim down. But Johnny <em>still</em> doesn't follow the instructions, drinks every can he's given, and while he does slim down <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's basically a two-inch stick person with a normal-sized head.</span>
</li><li> Lucky Piquel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers">Bonkers</a></em> is often the butt of some fat jokes since he's a very big guy. In one episode he's stressing out about having to lose some weight for an upcoming physical, which is made extremely difficult when the case of that episode involved the mascot of a snack cake company. However, thanks to sheer will power, Lucky manages to reach the required weight level for the physical (even though he doesn't look any slimmer). Bonkers, on the other hand, had spent most of the episode gorging on junk food and had gotten pretty fat.
</li><li> "Chew On This" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyGymPartnersAMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyGymPartnersAMonkey">My Gym Partner's a Monkey</a></em> had Adam complain about the fact that there wasn't any human food in the cafeteria. Fearing he might sue, Principal Pixie Frog changes the lunch menu to feature nothing but stuff humans eat. Jake and just about everyone else in the school (except Adam) get addicted because they're not used to eating pizza, french fries, and tater tots, and become very obese. When Adam is almost mobbed for his lunch, he threatens Pixie Frog that if he gets hurt he'd have grounds to sue the school, and offers not to in exchange for the menu being set back to the way it was. It then ends with everyone, the students and the staff, trying to lose weight.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KappaMikey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KappaMikey">Kappa Mikey</a></em> opened up with Gonard significantly tubbier than usual, and Ozu orders him to get back in shape because he's an action star. Gonard's forced to use Ozu's workout equipment, and while he becomes much more chiseled than he was before, he's now obsessed with exercising.
</li><li> Half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Dethklok's</a> band members have body image issues. Pickles and Skwisgaar are both rather slender and Toki's absolutely <em>ripped</em> under his clothes, but Nathan and Murderface are on the heavy side. Nathan is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFit">Formerly Fit</a> example but is seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulMan">Big Beautiful Man</a> due to the fact that he's more heavy than fat, while Murderface is out of shape and unattractive. Although in a later season episode, Nathan becomes increasingly concerned with his weight after accidentally breaking the hot tub by jumping into it and being labeled unattractive on a recent news editorial.
</li><li> Explored in a very unusual sense on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheMagicSchoolBus">The Magic School Bus</a></em>, in which the "woe" aspect comes not from fat or musculature, but <em>gravity</em>. Phoebe is concerned that she is unable to perform a special basketball feat for an upcoming game, and Ms. Frizzle uses this as an opportunity to teach the class about the concept of gravity. The bus transforms into an artificial planet, and the gravity is altered depending on how small or big the bus is. Unfortunately, someone knocks the gravity controls into high gear, enlarging the bus and increasing the gravity to such a degree that the kids are barely able to move and in danger of being crushed. Thankfully they manage to reach the controls in time before something bad happens.
</li><li> Done a number of times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> ''Weight Gain ': Cartman tries to bulk up using protein powder, but doesn't understand he needs to use the powder alongside an exercise regime. By the end of the episode, he's a morbidly obese blob and seriously believes he's a well-muscled hunk. BEEF CAKE!!!
</li><li> <em>Jared Has Aides</em>: Butters is forced to gain fifty pounds as part of a convoluted scheme by the boys to make money doing a bunch of commercials for City Wok similar to Jared from Subway. They then put Butters through a homemade liposuction treatment, which is literally just putting a tube in his side and pumping the excess fat out by punching his stomach. <em>It works</em>.
</li><li> <em>Fat Camp</em> featured Cartman getting sent to a fat camp against his will. He starts a lucrative business undermining the camp's efforts by smuggling junk food and selling it to the other kids. The rest of the campers, on their part, are all legitimately unhappy with how overweight they are, and their equally overweight parents don't have much hope for them as they believe their obesity is caused by genes. By the end of the episode when the camp is about to be shut down, one of the campers comes forward and admits they were cheating on their diets but wants to stay and make a more earnest attempt to slim down. When it looks like even Cartman has decided to make an effort to diet, the counselors (who were shown as upbeat and genuinely trying to help the kids) decide to have him banned because of what he did. Cartman curses them off... and then starts eating junk food and crying while he does.
</li><li> <em>Make Love, Not Warcraft</em>: The boys spend weeks doing nothing but killing boars to power up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> so they can finally stop the one player who keeps killing everybody's characters whenever they try to go on quests. In the process, Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman become overweight, greasy-haired shut-ins with horrendous acne.
</li><li> <em>Raising The Bar</em>: As obesity becomes more widespread, Cartman finally stops denying he is fat... and then intentionally gains more weight to qualify as obese and get a mobility scooter of his own. Cartman then takes advantage of his new handicapped status the way every other obese person in the episode does.
</li></ul></li><li> Pam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> gets mocked a lot for her weight, and was especially stressed out by it in the first season. By the second season, Pam evolved into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">Big Beautiful Woman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> who shot back by mocking Cheryl's skinnier frame. However, during the fifth season when ISIS starts smuggling cocaine, Pam gets addicted and ends up losing a lot of weight. For a number of reasons, including that Pam <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInDumbass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInDumbass">Took a Level in Dumbass</a>, everyone says they liked her better before, not after, she got addicted. The sixth season reveals she gained back the weight she lost after beating her cocaine habit.
</li><li> An ongoing plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em> was Cleveland Jr.'s sudden obesity, apparently brought on by the depression caused around the dissolution of his family when Cleveland and Loretta divorced. Though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a later episode (possibly) revealed the obese Jr. is a secret agent who murdered the original and took his place to enact a complex sting operation on Cleveland's neighbor, Tim the Bear, supposedly a ruthless terrorist leader</span>. In one particular episode, Cleveland starts wearing a man girdle to trick Donna into thinking he's lost weight, using it as an excuse to gorge himself. By the end of the episode, he's gained so much weight he finally bursts out of the girdle looking fatter than usual.
</li><li> A one-time segment on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em> featured "Fatman and Boy Blubber," two morbidly obese superheroes who protect the overweight people of the world. After saving the chubby Louis from bullies, they deliver (supposedly) inspirational lectures about their own struggles with obesity, including their attempts to stay healthy and tendency to eat fast food and snacks while traveling. It all turns out to be a sham, as the segment ends with Fatman and Boy Blubber trying to steal Louis' sweet buns for themselves.
</li><li> "Arthur Weighs In," an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>, had the titular aardvark discovering that he needed to wear a "husky" suit for a play (despite not looking any different) after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">abruptly developing lazy habits that had never shown up before</a>). He struggles to lose the weight by going on a diet; Brain then tells him that restrictive diets don't work—a surprising case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for a kid's show—and are <em>especially</em> dangerous for children, instead suggesting that he eat a variety of foods and make healthier choices instead. Mr. Ratburn (who turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat">Formerly Fat</a> himself) then helps Arthur out by encouraging him to exercise by providing the whole class with pedometers. The combination of better eating and more physical activity helps Arthur shed the excess pounds, and he wears a smaller suit for the play.
</li><li> Happens occasionally on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>
<ul><li> Jon puts on a noticeable amount of weight in one episode and decides to go on a diet, especially after seeing an appetizing looking diet program on tv. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryFalseAdvertising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryFalseAdvertising">He along with Garfield are both sorely disappointed when the food turns out to be the size of a grain of rice and tastes terrible.</a>
</li><li> Jon's neighbors, the Burnsides, decide to move, tired of Garfield always stealing their food. They soon realize, however, that with Garfield no longer around, they both put on a lot of weight in a very short amount of time. They quickly move back before they end up "looking like elephants by Christmastime".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a></em>: Arthur goes on a diet in "The Tick vs. Arthur" after being called fat by a goon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">in the previous episode</a>. He gets a power belt off a baddy that makes him strong and muscular but turns him evil.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">Beach Episode</a>, Kaeloo decides to play volleyball because she realizes that she's getting fat; however, the plot becomes so sidetracked by the end of the episode that the audience never finds out if she ever <em>did</em> lose the extra weight.
</li><li> Played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> in one Dr. Weird sketch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a></em>. In it, Dr. Weird shows off to Steve that he's lost weight. Manually. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery">With a chainsaw</a>.

<ul><li> French actress Isabelle Caro gained world fame when she posed for a <a class="urllink" href="http://img.welt.de/img/prominente/crop102009797/7009732832-ci3x2l-w540/jw-hunger-DW-Politik-Rome.jpg">''No Anorexia''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> campaign that specifically targeted the film and fashion industry for forcing actresses and models to be unnaturally thin, encouraging anorexia. She died in 2010 of pneumonia at the age of only 28 since her body was too weakened to handle the sickness. Her lowest weight had been only 25 kg(~) at age 24.
</li><li> Tracey Gold, who played Carol Seaver on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains">Growing Pains</a>,</em> seriously battled with anorexia nervosa for much of her life. Her condition became life-threatening during filming of <em>Growing Pains</em> when her character was mocked as "fat" in multiple episodes, making her more obsessive about weight in real life. In 1992, she had to resign from the show for medical reasons, and would not return until the series finale.
<ul><li> Tracey actually went on to star in the television film <em>For The Love of Nancy</em>, which was about a teenage girl suffering through anorexia after graduating high school and entering college. This was made in 1994, two years after <em>Growing Pains</em> ended.

</li><li> Generally speaking, women not only gain weight more easily than men, but many have a significantly more difficult time losing it, particularly in the abdomen.
<ul><li> Part of this is because when you lose weight, no matter what part of you that you're exercising, you shed weight in order of the parts of the body that need it the least - in a woman the abdomen being the last place with any excess because any fat makes for a great cushion to protect your reproductive organs. In men, it's the thighs that are the last place with an excess.
</li><li> Along the same vein, regardless of gender, weight-loss becomes harder and harder as a person ages, so a twenty-year-old would have a much easier time of it than a forty-year-old.
</li><li> It has been proven that once fat cells fill up with fat, more fat cells will grow to accommodate the excess, and they never go away. Even after liposuction, these extra fat cells will <em>grow back</em>, which is why it's so easy to regain weight even after losing it.
