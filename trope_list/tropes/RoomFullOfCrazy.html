Confessions, mathematical equations, rants, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladPhilosophy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordSaladPhilosophy">screeds</a> are also popular. These can be supplemented with pictures, newspaper articles, official documents, etc. Usually, a character will find some room in their environment upon which to fully express the terms of their obsession. And don't expect these characters to be deterred by the fact that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldntFindAPen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldntFindAPen">Couldn't Find a Pen</a>; they'll write with their own blood if they have to.
</p><p>Characters who display this kind of behavior are not always dangerous or even fully insane, but they are always obsessed.

It's not unusual for this moment of discovery to be quickly followed by an attempt on the discoverer's life by the owner of the room. These rooms can be also be susceptible to cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHereISwear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHereISwear">vanishings as well</a>. (Curse you, Pine Sol!)
</p><p>It should be noted that a character doesn't have to cover the walls with writing to make this an effective trope. A neatly typed ream of crisp white paper reading "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy</a>" will work just as well.
</p><p>If the Room Full of Crazy is specific enough, for example, only part of a wall is covered with photos of the same subject, it may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerShrine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerShrine">Stalker Shrine</a>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrineToSelf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrineToSelf">Shrine to Self</a> may likewise double as a Room Full Of Crazy for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniacs</a> and the like.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBugRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBugRoom">Black Bug Room</a> is the mental version of this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDollEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDollEpisode">The Doll Episode</a> may include a room full of dolls for similar effect.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ibitsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ibitsu">Ibitsu</a></em>, Kazuki discovers a room in the abandoned mental hospital where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the lolita covered large portions of the walls and floor by writing 'big brother' over and over.</span>
</li><li> Schwartzwald in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em> has apparently discovered the secret behind Paradigm City's mass amnesia, and what happened to the rest of the world forty years ago. His reaction is to wrap himself up in bandages, murder aristocrats via arson, commandeer a giant robot (and verbally harass its new pilot <em>after</em> his death), and leave typewriters - sometimes dozens of them - wherever he goes, filled with rantings to curse the foolish and blind residents of the city. Depending on interpretation, the bit about the giant robot may not count; it's well-established and even invoked by another character at this point that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the mecha of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a> partially think for themselves and have a brotherhood-like preference for their pilots,</span> so Schwartzwald laughing in Alan Gabriel's face for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> trying to pilot Big Duo</span> could be the most logical thing he ever says.
</li><li> An odd version of this trope turns up in the anime film adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em>. Tima, after being taken into the custody of the man who had her created in the first place and being denied access to Kenichi, the boy on whom she'd imprinted, proceeds to scrawl his name all over the walls and windows of the luxury bedroom she was given. This was especially powerful, given how innocent Tima's character is, and scares the maid that brings her a change of clothes witless. All the same though, it was more Tima sulking than anything truly horrific or psychological.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>: Johan leaves behind a number of messages, some bragging, some asking for help.
</li><li> A mild form seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kureno's curse broke</span> and Akito started going...even more crazy. Not forgetting the crazy room Akito <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">made for Yuki when he was a child</span>, filled with black and darkness to slowly drive him insane.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>, Matoi Tsuetsuki stalks anyone she falls in love with.In the end of the chapter she is introduced in, she is shown in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerShrine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerShrine">a room/closet full of pictures of Itoshiki</a>. If you look closely, you can see a picture of him chugging pills and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHOLiC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHOLiC">×××HOLiC</a></em>'s characters told ghost stories about people who stumbled across one of these rooms in a haunted house. ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Let me out! Let me out! Father, please let me out!</a>")
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> uses this, as seen in this <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OigyytALZHc">this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. A subtle use of this trope is Doctor Ritsuko Akagi, NERV's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotScientist">Hot Scientist</a>. At first her tendency to leave post-it notes all over her cubicle and the MAGI computer makes Ritsuko seem like she's just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Workaholic">workaholic</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCatLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyCatLady">liking for cats</a>, but in the second half of the series we realise she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">seriously disturbed</a>.
<ul><li> Her mother, Naoko, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">is almost exactly the same way.</a> When they have to get inside the Caspar core, its entire inside is covered with post-its, with almost no space left free. At least one reads "Ikari! YOU JERK!"
</li><li> Rei's original room in Central Dogma might also count: there are various terms related to quantum physics written onto the walls. It also happens to have the exact same layout as her current apartment's living room.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the first victims in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Uzumaki">Uzumaki</a></em> has a room filled with spiral-related items: mosquito coils, numerous shells, spiral-patterned clothes, etc. When these are thrown out in an effort to stop his psychosis, he is... less then pleased.
<ul><li> Likewise, Ito's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gyo">Gyo</a></em> features the Citrus Circus. It's all the fun of the circus, but almost everyone's infected (Except the ringmaster, who's just insane, and a few other members of his troupe) and collosal Animal walkers roam the Big Top.
</li></ul></li><li> The narrators in Hideshi Hino's horror stories invariably have houses or shops full of crazy, filled with disturbing paintings, horrible things in jars, and/or macabre junk.
</li><li> After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kamina is killed by Thymilph</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>, one of the signs that Simon's grasp on sanity is slipping is his tendency to lock himself in his room and use his drill to obsessively carve statues of the deceased over and over until the room is literally filled with them.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Reki paints her nightmares</span> into such a room in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei">Haibane Renmei</a></em>.
</li><li> In surreal anime film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paprika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paprika">Paprika</a></em>, Himuro has an entire apartment full of crazy. There are shelves filled with broken toys and dolls (all of them move and make noises), walls coated with photos of himself and his friend Tokita (with Tokitas's face cut out) and little lit-up signs that say "help me." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This signifies the fact that the dream world has overwhelmed his mind.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother">Dear Brother</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rei Asaka aka Hana no Saint Juste</span>) has <em>two</em> Rooms Full of Crazy.

</li><li> In the anime, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fukiko "Miya-sama" Ichinomiya</span> has a room obsessively preserved for six years because that's where she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> first met the guy she has a crush on.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> the Dollars chatroom blows up with crazy anytime Saika shows up. Incredibly fast spam messages full of crazy cover the chatroom. They consist of such delightful phrases as "Cutcutcutcutcutcut" or cries for mother.
</li><li> Lucia's cell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> which probably wasn't done in blood because several of his messages implied that he had yet to harm anyone, and there's no way he had enough blood to fill that cell.
</li><li> Old Cho's room in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Domu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Domu">Domu</a>: A Child's Dream</em> is completely filled with little trinkets that he has collected from every person he killed.

When it so happens that one day Spider-Man saves his life and calls him "my eyes and ears" after he calls himself a nobody, he gets overconfident and tries to fix dangerous electrical equipment in Oscorp labs by himself, leading to the accident that turns him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro">Electro</a>.

</li><li> Beckett's home murder board, where she obsessively tries to solve her mother's case, isn't precisely a Room Full of Crazy, but the authors used the similar imagery to suggest that Beckett's obsession isn't entirely sane, either — something Beckett herself readily admits.

<ul><li> Seeing all of the marks on the wall made by the thumbtacks Alexander Mahone, the FBI agent put in charge of capturing the escapees, realizes the depth of Michael's plan to get Lincoln out of Fox River. Mahone would later recreate Michael's plans on his basement wall in an attempt to get one step ahead of Michael and catch him. Mahone's was much of a Room Full of Crazy situation as he became obsessed with catching Michael.

He's written a key word over and over on bits of paper and cardboard. It's deliberate; inspired by his native flair for the dramatic rather than any mental illness on his part, although arguably everyone who works for the Fallon Collection is slightly off their rockers.
</li><li> In the fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em>, Effy is suffering from psychotic depression (incidentally, a case of the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">giving Effy a real mental illness</a> instead of a simple case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>) and covers her wall in morbid collages, including newspaper clippings about deaths.

The fake world of Benny Russell in the '50s pops up a few other times in the series, and the writers were considering having the last scene be Benny on a Hollywood set, holding a script titled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a>".

<ul><li> Season one has Joyce fill the entire house with an absurd amount of lights - from standing lamps to Christmas lights - to make contact with Will in the Upside-Down. One of the walls is dedicated to one specific set of Christmas lights, each light corresponding to a letter of the alphabet, allowing Will to talk to her.
</li><li> In season two, Will draws a map of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mind Flayer's</span> tunnels that run under Hawkins. However, the full map is so large that it takes up the entire house, covering the floor, walls and furniture and drawn on anything that so much as resembles paper.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Treadstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Treadstone">Treadstone</a></em>. John Bentley discovers a room in Budapest where he tortured fellow CIA operatives as a brainwashed Soviet agent, and sees his own name written over and over on the walls. He then finds tapes of himself doing the torturing with no apparent memory of who he was, implying this trope was due to his real personality trying to resurface.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodSerling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RodSerling">Rod Serling</a> said that when he was getting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone">The Twilight Zone</a></em> started, "I got 15,000 manuscripts in the first five days.

The rest were well-written but unsuitable for the program.

<ul><li> Also in the third season, in keeping with his more subtle villainy, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Governor</span> keeps his room full of crazy hidden. He has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his zombie daughter</span> locked in a closet, another closet full of zombie heads in jars, and a notebook.

<ul><li> The audio commentaries that get activated when you've finished the game only make it weirder. Inside many of those same rooms are audio clips by GLaDOS' fantastic voice actress, who delivers her random anecdotes with a certain frantic, hysteric edge to her voice that just makes it freaking creepy. Presumably this was fully intentional on the part of Valve.

Among other things, the place holds: a rabid living dog, multiple rotting dead bodies (possibly as dog food), walls splattered with blood, the decayed head of said mother, and a really creepy diary. Half of it a personal message to his mother, promising revenge, the rest is the word "killhim" written over and over, in blood.
</li><li> You can find the diary of a vampire who was trapped in his mansion and eventually went insane from hunger. The last page reads "blood blood blood food blood blood food blood..."
</li><li> A paranoid Bosmer (Wood Elf) suspects his neighbors are plotting against his life and asks you to investigate them. If you go into his basement, you may find the notes he's been keeping about your investigation - including his belief that <em>you're</em> "one of them," depending on how you respond to his concerns.
</li><li> One fellow apparently thought it would be swell to swipe a sacred artifact of a <em>nightmare goddess</em> and explore the depths of terror within one's own mind. Tasked to retrieve the artifact, you find a pocket dimension with a room of over-sized furnishings, doors to ledges over endless oceans of lava, and naturally blood and organic bits of things strewn all about. The subject himself is asleep in a bed in a shattered room, with his notes nearby. At first they reflect his scholarly and fanatical delights over discovering such wondrous agonies to experience, but they finally end with him simply writing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow">"THE HORROR,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeartOfDarkness">THE HORROR."</a>

<ul><li> In the first game, you can find two of these rooms in each of the four Ages, belonging to Atrus' sons. It's easy to tell who's is whose: Sirrus' rooms have a look of sophistication while betraying a mind touched by madness, and feature things like a hologram projector that morphs a rose into a human skull, or hidden bottles of poison. Achenar's rooms practically <em>giggle</em> and are filled with weapons, torture implements, or human remains like a ribcage lampshade.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MystIIIExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MystIIIExile">Myst III: Exile</a></em>, the player enters Saavedro's lair at one point, which has, among various experiments and other things, a very large portrait of his wife on the wall with no eyes. Not exactly a room <em>full</em> of crazy, but definitely crazy.
</li></ul></li><li> The player comes across these rooms quite frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering">The Suffering</a></em>, IE the room full of Rorschach ink blots all over the wall, along with a dead guard on a couch with some strange device on his head that seems to have popped his eye out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrialsOfMana">Trials of Mana</a></em>, your heroes are in need of a ship to cross the sea, and find one with a captain willing to take them for free. After the first night on the ship, they awaken to find the whole thing decrepit and crawling with undead. A captain's log they find has several mundane entries about usual naval doings, but the final page <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is just the word "death" repeated over and over</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw">Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw's</a> third entry in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChzoMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChzoMythos">Chzo Mythos</a></em> series, <em>Trilby's Notes</em>, features a parser system like the text games of yore, with the interface representing Trilby's descriptions of the events of the game, as the game itself is a flashback occurring as he produces a record for the paranormal investigations agency he now works for. At some of the freakier points of the game (and sometimes just at random), an attempt to perform an action will just result in his notebook reading "it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts." This is all happening while he's phasing back and forth between a Welsh hotel and a rotting alternate-universe counterpart, which has a certain number, vague warnings, symbols, and odd notes (such as two doorways being labeled "man" and "not man") written in blood everywhere. The implication is that Trilby's notes are peppered with mad ravings in between the facts...

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em>, one of the files you find is the diary of a man who has been bitten by a zombie. His writing degenerates into incoherence until finally it's nothing but "Itchy. Tasty." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When you put the diary down, he attacks from the closet.</span>
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> features these all around the ship, most blood-writings being pleas of help or saying how to fight the Necromorphs. One peculiar area is where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you get a sample of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> to decontaminate the air</span>, the room features a lot of writing, red cloths and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleJars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleJars">People Jars</a>.
<ul><li> And, in a subversion, or lampshading or.. something, one will occasionally find amidst the deranged wall-scrawl such oddities as, 'Sorry, family emergency. Where were we again?'
</li><li> This carries over in the animated comics and I think it also appears in the anime movie too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em> continues the first game's tradition and adds a new one: an audio log contains a remark that the mental patients are using anything and everything to make replicas of the Marker, from toothpicks and toiletries to blood and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">feces</a>.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, during your first trip into the other world, you find a room created by the murdered announcer's repressed emotions, plastered with photos of Namatame's wife with her face cut out, and a noose hanging smack in the middle of the room. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">Also, Yosuke almost peed there</a>.

It also contains a couple of nods to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArkhamAsylumASeriousHouseOnSeriousEarth">Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth</a></em>. You can find Amadeus Arkham's cell in the game, and as in the comic it's covered in "magic circles". Late in the game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Batman leaves warden Quincy Sharpe locked in a room for his own safety. If you return later, Sharpe is gone and the room is now covered with writing (mostly "Batman" over and over) as well as the final Spirit of Arkham message that reveals Sharpe is the Spirit.</span>

In the final room of the game, phrases like "Liar" and "Accomplice" are etched into the walls <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> every time you turn away, as the realization that you, Batman, are the killer sinks in. This also clues you, the <em>player</em>, into the fact that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>.</span>

</li><li> Similarly, Nathaniel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeavyRain">Heavy Rain</a></em> has a whole apartment full of crazy. One room is covered in crosses, while another has Biblical passages scrawled all over the walls. While he is deeply religious, the fact that he hears voices may suggest that he is insane as well as obsessed.
</li><li> Taken to extremes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkFall">Dark Fall</a>: Lost Souls</em>, in which the entire Station Hotel is a variant of this trope. Rooms with writing on the walls (hundreds of eyes; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a>'s drawing of the hotel in black crayon; neat rows of writing in an ancient mystical language) are just the beginning: try rooms <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with hundreds of scissors or syringes stuck into the walls</span>, or a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> buffet where a homeless man has laid out roadkill dinners for mannequins, complete with menus that list dogs, pigeons, squirrels and rats by their Latin names</span>.

Looking at the door, you also realize that whoever was trapped in there has tried to claw their way out and open the door with the bloody clawmarks left behind.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlanWake">Alan Wake</a></em> has this, written by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Cynthia Weaver</span> in her characteristic light-sensitive paint. It has the word "Tom" written over and over again, and includes other phrases like "I miss you Tom," "I curse you, Thomas Zane". The first one you can come across is a heart that says "CW+TZ". Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Weaver</span> is obsessed with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> light</span>. In one chapter, she reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she has a room (appropriately dubbed the Well-Lit Room) inside the dam that she completely covered with lights. This is understandable given that she knows about the Taken and their weakness to light, but she obsessively maintains the room and knows - by their assigned number - which specific bulbs need replacing. It's not until the player gets to this room that they understand just how obsessed she is.</span>
</li><li> Almost every room in the cult mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT4">SWAT 4</a></em> is one of these to some extent, but the cap on the whole thing is the basement, in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the cult members have buried all of their children, which were sacrificed to their gods, and crazy messages are written all over the walls.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Penumbra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Penumbra">Penumbra: Overture</a></em>, you find the room that Red had been trapped in for decades, with black writing on one wall with words like "Red is Dead" and "Liberty", alongside pictures of crucifixes and a noose - which is in the room next door. There's also some old posters of girls with eyes and mouths taped over their faces.
<ul><li> There's also a science lab further back, full of slug dissections and creepy diagrams. Once you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> flip the switch</span> in the next room, numerous scribblings that read <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"the blood is deep" and "the darkness eats parasite" become visible on the walls, having been written in invisible ink.</span> If you manage to find a (rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">door-stopping</a>) note in there, it turns out that a scientist from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Shelter in <em>Black Plague</em></span> fled here not long before Philip arrived, and barricaded the area while on the run from the giant worms, going crazy while trying to find a way to stop them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He eventually killed himself just before the worms found him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Toward the end of the survival horror/human drama game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FragileDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FragileDreams">Fragile Dreams</a></em>, the player enters a room that, when viewed with the special flashlight, has "I don't want to die!" scrawled on nearly every surface. Said flashlight also illuminates a good number of other creepy phrases throughout the game, including the word "help" written in what appears to be blood and with the kanji smeared near the locked door of the abandoned hotel. Going through the amusement park with the flashlight reveals that Crow does this, too. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Including one instance of referring to himself by a serial number.</span>
</li><li> As Alister Azimuth talks to Ratchet about his father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureACrackInTime">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: A Crack In Time</a></em>, Ratchet slowly scans the interior of his home to discover countless obsessive notes and drawings about the Great Clock. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's the first hint that Alister's preoccupation with bringing back the Lombaxes will lead to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>.</span>

</li><li> The walls of Professor Buildson's office in <em>Sable Maze 2: Norwich Caves</em> are covered with crude drawings and scrawls such as "I heard his voice" and "He will be released!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cursery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Cursery">Cursery</a>: The Crooked Man and the Crooked Cat</em> has clippings and notes scattered throughout the game. One such note concerning the villain's late love interest mentions selling his soul to a witch, followed by:

There's a hole in the world." on the floor.
</li><li> In <em>Grim Tales 7: Color of Fright</em> a secret room used by the villain contains dark murals, several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyDoll">Creepy Dolls</a>, a mannequin in a wedding dress (with a sign with Louisa's name hanging from it) and a painting with "I am Thomas Gray...I am Thomas..." repeated over and over in blood-red lettering.

Issues with the town's mascot, Dinky the Dinosaur. Nobody ever buys his Dinky figurines. He has nearly a <em>thousand</em> of them to sell! He just has <em>so many</em> Dinkies that he can't store them all into his shop. So when you enter his house, you will almost be <em>walking all over</em> Dinky figurines. And the way they are exposed, he doesn't keep them in his house <em>only</em> because he has no other place to store them.

Except without a pen, he's been forced to tattoo himself, and has resorted to Da Vinci layering with different combinations of his body and the wall to keep the Furies from reading the less complimentary parts, and of course he's somewhat jittery all the time. In his words, the Furies used to be harsh-but-fair before a specific incident, so it's implied he had access to pen and parchment until they stopped caring about their prison and the state it's currently in.
