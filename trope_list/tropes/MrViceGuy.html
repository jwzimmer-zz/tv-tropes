Sometimes the good guys can take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a> as their companion, whether it's the new guy showing that they can slay monsters more efficiently or if the helpless civilians find him or her more charming than them. While villains would try and drag that other guy down, a hero can take their resentment of their peers and channel it into a zeal for self-improvement.

Besides, sometimes their bravado is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeEgo">completely justified</a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Recklessness</a></strong>. They'll throw themselves at danger with reckless abandon for the sheer thrill of it, which can be a serious problem when faced with a danger that won't go down without a serious fight.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">Selfishness</a></strong>.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Sloth</a></strong>. It takes them awhile to get out of bed to save your life and they try to do it the easy way first and foremost, but in a stressful world of action and danger sometimes the hero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigLebowski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigLebowski">has to take it easy and abide for the rest of the sinners out there</a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">Vanity</a></strong>. Sometimes a hero is so confident in himself - both as a fighter and a lover - that it can take them to places they are desperate to leave but unable to escape. But that unearned confidence can be incredibly useful if nudged in the right direction. Just because they're vain, doesn't mean they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, nor does it mean they are incapable of acknowledging other people.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Wrath</a></strong>. A short-tempered hero can be a sloppy one, but that rage gives them the focus to face a world of danger without fear. After all, when faced against threats that seek to harm the peace, safety and tranquility of your loved ones, what's there to be serene about?

If you asked her, she'd probably describe herself as "pragmatic" rather than "criminal," though, and she does seem to regret what she sees as the necessity of the crimes in question.

While Hiccup's biggest strengths are his capacity for compassion and his intelligence, Hiccup was raised in a Viking village who lived under the idea that one's physical strength, skills in weapons and ability to kill dragons is more important and thus he did not value these skills as much as he should have, causing him to act without thinking ahead. When he tried using his natural skill in inventing to take down dragons his own way, not only did it earn him the scorn of the village (mainly because it accidentally caused a net full of dragons to escape and destroy half of the village in the process), but when it gives him the opportunity to actually kill a dragon, he empathized with the dragon too much to go through with it and freed it instead, a move that could have gotten himself skilled. After his compassion was proven to be a good thing (leading to peace between them and the dragons), he would place too much confidence in his diplomatic abilities and leaves him too trusting of strangers, something that has caused more problems in the long run; not suspecting Heather having ulterior motives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she was acting as a spy for Alvin</span>, thinking Torch is harmless <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he is causing massive amounts of mischief and leads his mother to the village</span>, thinking he can reason with Drago <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leading to his father's death and his village nearly being obliterated</span>, etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles">The Incredibles</a></em> gives us Bob Parr, better known as Mister Incredible. He's a genuine hero with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and enhanced reflexes—but after superheroism is made illegal due to frivolous lawsuits, he and every other "Cape" in the world is forced into retirement. Despite the new laws and the pressures of his own family, though, Bob can't resist sneaking out at night and doing anonymous hero work. It's partially because he genuinely wants to help people, but also clear that his motives are somewhat selfish, as he misses the glory of being Mr. Incredible and having fun in the spotlight.

His attempt to force out his statement of support for his wife is aptly described as "excruciating", and the news report about her big return to the spotlight clearly makes him feel like he's chewing glass. At the same time, even when he's staying at home, he's a good enough man that when he doesn't understand his son's homework enough to help, he claws himself out of bed in the early hours of the morning to go over the textbook and figure it out.

<ul><li> The 1971 version of one of the "Bratty Kids", Augustus Gloop, is actually presented as a very quiet, polite, well dressed and groomed kid. Apart from his (implied) massive gluttony, he doesn't seem to be a bad kid at all. The book and latter adaptation, make him a horrid bullying slob, however.
</li></ul></li><li> John Hammond, founder of InGen and creator of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a>, is a genuinely good person, a kind employer, and a wonderful grandfather. The downfall of Jurassic Park was in part because of his pride and well-meaning ambition: all he wanted to do was show the world something real, not an illusion like his first business venture, the flea circus Petticoat Lane, and didn't quite care enough how he got there, breeding dangerous dinosaurs such as the velociraptors, stocking the visitor areas with poisonous plants because they look nice, and his reliance on automation to maintain the park being the main reason the disaster could even take place thanks to his corrupt head programmer Dennis Nedry. In the end, after numerous deaths and serious threats to the lives of his grandchildren, Hammond agrees with cynical Ian Malcolm and initially optimistic Alan Grant that Jurassic Park shouldn't be and abandons his dream. This is in contrast to how Hammond was portrayed in the original novel, where he was a Jerkass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> who blamed everyone but himself for the park's failure, and was planning to try again even after the disaster there, which claimed far more lives than in the film.
<ul><li> Hammond's spiritual successor Simon Masrani claims to have sworn to Hammond on his deathbed that he would make his dream a reality and do it right, creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a>, which becomes a massive success possibly beyond even Hammond's vision. He's essentially a modern Hammond, just as kind-hearted and well-meaning, caring more for the happiness of the guests and animals than for his profit margins, and generally sees the good in everyone. Unfortunately, he's a little <em>too</em> trusting, leaving head geneticist Henry Wu and chief of security Vic Hoskins to their devices and ultimately leading to the creation of the hybrid dinosaur <em>Indominus rex</em> which causes another disaster on the island.

In the end he was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of three wizards willing to personally fight with Voldemort.</span> This doubles as a demonstration that he's not just 'famous for being famous', or for his potion skills, but that he is an incredibly talented and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">well-rounded</a> wizard.

However, he also gets jealous very easily, a weakness that threatened to tear apart the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> on several occasions.
</li><li> Hermione is not exempt from this. Her perfectionist attitude and her drive to be as best as she can causes her to somewhat feel threatened whenever someone manages to surpass her, such as Harry scoring higher than her in the Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL, or the potions class in the sixth year.

</li><li> Crowley of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em> is literally on Earth for the sole purpose of making people miserable, and he does so quite happily. He also has a lot of pride and vanity—he likes looking sharp and driving an <em>extremely</em> nice car. However, he is mostly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> who recognizes that he'll never do anything that humans don't do to themselves far more effectively than hell ever could, and he's even willing to do an occasional good deed on behalf of his angelic buddy Aziraphale (who would in turn do a bad deed for him). In the end, he's one of the most sympathetic characters in the book and wants to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">avert the apocalypse</span> simply because he likes Earth and humanity.
</li><li> Henry Bacon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragons">The Last Dragon Chronicles</a> is staid, grumpy, and old-fashioned to the point of being stifling. He's not exactly a Friend to All Children. He's even the primary antagonist of the first book in the series. However, as the later books prove, he is nonetheless a loyal neighbor who truly does care about his neighbors and their friends. Even if he does think they're a little loopy.
</li></ul><ul><li> Samuel Vimes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> is alcoholic and pessimistic, but still intentionally sympathetic, honorable, and serious about being a cop, in his own way. By the second book he appears in, he stops drinking, but nothing can shake the pessimism.
</li><li> Li Kao of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeOfBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeOfBirds">Bridge of Birds</a></em> is fond of introducing himself as a sage "with a slight flaw in my character". Said "slight flaw" includes alcoholism and a perfect willingness to lie to, rob, and kill people to achieve his ends without batting an eyelash. He even freely acknowledges to his much more pure-hearted companion Number Ten Ox that the only reason he didn't become a criminal instead of a crime-solving wise man was that he found committing crimes to be so easy that it became too boring for him. In spite of all of this, he's an unambiguously good guy whose morally questionable actions are done solely to find the ginseng root that will cure the dying children of Ten Ox's village and he isn't shy about expressing his disgust at the reprehensible deeds of the villains they meet during their quest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GautreksSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GautreksSaga">Gautrek's Saga</a></em>: Gautrek's friend Jarl Neri is a brave warrior, a clever advisor and a reliable ally to his friends and relations, but he is absurdly stingy. Yet he is very open about it and is very reluctant to accepts gifts, because he just cannot bring himself to give something in return, and yet does not want to rip people off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> is a cynical womanizing alcoholic, swears frequently and is little more than a government-sponsored assassin, but he saves the world regularly, tries to prevent innocent people from being hurt in his adventures and cares deeply for his friends.

Then, in <em>Torchwood</em>, he was (unwittingly) put in charge of Torchwood Cardiff, and his vices expand from merely flirting with everyone to also being in charge, dammit! Of course, he will forgive you. But first he will shoot whatever you thought you could get away with having in his base, or outside of it, or possibly teleport it into the sun or erase its existence entirely.

He's capable of amazing heroism, but occasionally shows a hideous streak of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">pride</a>, occasionally bordering on (and in at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars">one episode</a>, crossing into) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a> territory. Pride and the occasional dash of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hubris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hubris">Hubris</a> are constants for all Doctors, but individual incarnations have their glaring character flaws as well. Even after the First Doctor gets some character development and stops being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic Hero</a>, he remains naturally rude and surly, even making several racist comments.

The Ninth Doctor's surliness and anger are exaggerated by a boatload of Time War trauma. <br/><br/>All Doctors tend to be unbelievably vain, though the precise mechanism of this changes with the Doctor. Some take pleasure in fussy, expensive outfits; others take pleasure in fussy, expensive outfits that they then wear in a deliberately scruffy way so they don't look too fussy and expensive; others take pleasure in dressing in outrageous clothes in the misguided belief that they are so gorgeous they can pull off anything; some love <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">being the centre of attention</a>; others feel <em>entitled</em> to being the centre of attention and whine if they aren't; some make a habit of lying about their age to flatter themselves.

But he can, on very rare occasions, show a kindly side (not that he'd ever admit it, as being nasty and short-tempered is <em>expected</em> of his species) and help out his neighbors on the block.
<ul><li> There's also Cookie Monster, who will devour not just his favorite sweets, but anything in his path—edible or otherwise—if he's hungry enough. Despite his gluttonous actions, though, he's a sweethearted pile of fuzz who genuinely loves his friends and family, and will often end up doing the right thing even if it means sacrificing cookies.

But she'll do anything for her friends, clients, and especially for her special-needs brother Ansel.
</li><li> The four humans that make up the main group in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace">The Good Place</a></em> each have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> that landed each of them in the Bad Place to be tortured for eternity, the crux of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> being each of them realizing this and working to become better with each other's help.
<ul><li> Eleanor Shellstrop is best defined by her Selfishness. In life she was proven to be a leech who repeatedly ignored the general needs of other people, routinely breaking her promises first short-term pleasures and starting drama unprovoked under the cynical assumption that the world is looking down on her, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a mindset she learned at a young age because her parents were both selfish people who routinely ignored her needs</span>. Michael's torture for her involved her believing that she was mistaken for an objectively better person who she shares a name with, forcing her to put up with Chidi in order to blend into a neighborhood full of people tailor-made to exacerbate her insecurities. Since her selfishness comes from self-emnity instead of pride, she is fully aware that she isn't a good person, giving her a sobering clarity that the rest of the group seem to lack, with most of the reboots Michael puts them through showing that she is usually the one who finds out that they are actually in the Bad Place.
</li><li> While Chidi is the one of the most genuinely nice members of the group and had dedicated his life to learning the perfect moral standard of living through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">careful research, consistently weighing options and finding the objective truth with no heart to give it direction can create the perfect ethical life</a>, but this has also left him with a crippling fear of inducing moral consequences of his actions. This level of cowardess landed him in the Bad Place because while his intentions were good, all it ever did was make the people around him miserable. Michael's method of torturing him was by pairing him up with Eleanor, a "utilitarian nightmare" that gives him an endless list of conflicting ethical quandaries. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ironically, Season 3 reveals that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a> in his dithering, the archaic nature of the moral point system clashing with the interconnected nature of modern times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">making it impossible for anyone to get into the Good Place for over five-hundred years</a></span>.
</li><li> Tahani has dedicated her life to raising money for charity and good causes, but she only ever did it out of envy for her sister Kamilah, who was always loved more by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> and by the general public. While she did a lot good that should have earned her points, her selfless desire for attention made all of her actions worthless. In Michael's neighborhood, she would be constantly tormented by the thought that she was second best at everything; she would notice that she had been at the bottom of the points list and become self-conscious by it, she would think that her soulmate Jianyu does not care about her, she would fall in-love with Chidi when he preferred Eleanor/Real!Eleanor, etc.
</li><li> Jason is a genuinely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> and has been dealt a rough hand at life by being born in-poverty, but most of his problems are caused by his reckless inability to think anything through, usually for short-term immediate rewards. This led to him living a life of street-crime and generally being a stain on society as a whole, with his death (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">suffocating in a large safe in an attempt to rob a restaraunt</span>) being a direct by-product of his idiocy. Michael would weaponize his impatience in his Good place experiment by "confusing" him for a silent Taiwanese Buddhist monk Jianyu, forcing him to control his impulses and generally not allowing him to express himself the way he wants.

If anything, the only reason she has such a good track record is because she was chasing after Sly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadGuysDoTheDirtyWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadGuysDoTheDirtyWork">she happens to find other high profile criminals after the Cooper Gang had dismantled their operations and beaten them up beforehand</a>. Not only that, but she is also a terrible shot with her shock pistol and tends to fire it wildly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance">often causing an ambiguous amount of damage</a> in the process. That being said, she is righteous in her motives, she is harsh but not cruel and is capable of seeing reason, often joins up with the Cooper Gang when she is out of options or when there is a bigger threat that they can work together in beating.

<ul><li> Weiss is initially a victim of Pride, at first believing she's too good for most people and then certainly better than her partner, Ruby. Character development kicks in fairly quickly and she gets over it.
</li><li> In Volume 4, Blake shows that she's a victim of selfishness. She thinks she's protecting her friends from danger by leaving them behind(especially when Adam swore to kill everyone she loves), but Sun points out that turning away from people who want to help her only hurts them more.
</li><li> James Ironwood is also a victim of Pride, assuming that he's the one in the right and making the correct decisions. While harsh in his ruling, he does everything for the sake of protecting Atlas and the world at large from monsters like Salem.

One wouldn't think an arrogant womanizer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> could be such a likable character, but some people think he pulls it off through a combination of sheer charisma and being a big softie on the inside.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em>:
<ul><li> Self-proclaimed "Chaotic Good-ish" thief Haley Starshine is sneaky and greedy, but ultimately good-hearted and even prone to surprising moments of charity. Though she's always been avaricious, part of the reason she glomps so fiercely onto money during the comic is that she needs to pay off an enormous ransom to save a family member.
</li><li> Roy Greenhilt also qualifies. He is a bit of an asshole sometimes and is mean and deadpan to most people he meets. But this doesn't stop him from being an essentially honorable, decent young man who wants nothing more than to defeat the forces of evil, even at the cost of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his own life, albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">temporarily</a></span>.

</li><li> Belkar is a kind of reversed trope. He'll stand up for his party members and is capable of great feats of heroism, but ultimately he's a homicidal sociopath who's only adventuring because it lets him commit atrocities he'd be arrested for otherwise. Played to the hilt with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0687.html">this comic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when he REALIZES IT'S TRUE.

Having a father as famous and skilled as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Slickis</a> gave him a lot to live up to, and he frequently flipped between resenting this and trying to exploit it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> runs on this trope. Every single character has severe personal issues, especially Bojack himself, being a narcissist, a heavy drinker and drug-user, and a womanizer. Diane has a compulsive need to inject her opinions into everything, even at the expense of her loved ones; Todd is a professional slacker, and something of a doormat; Princess Carolyn has been shown to be manipulative and greedy to get what she wants; and Mr. Peanutbutter has problems with boundaries and is prone to making rash impulsive decisions (often with Todd's help.) Still though, with the exception of Bojack, most everyone usually tries to help each other, and find great happiness in each other's success.
</li><li> The various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDisneyAfternoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDisneyAfternoon">The Disney Afternoon</a> series use this to great effect.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em>, Scrooge McDuck is, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge">The Scrooge</a> to sometimes absurd levels, but always honors his deals, does not resort to criminal means, and genuinely cares about his nephews and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterclassFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterclassFriendship">staff/friends</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Darkwing Duck</a></em> was less caught up on avarice than Pride - he was supremely arrogant, leading him to alienate allies and boast like a Bond villain... but there's a <em>reason</em> he named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">Let's Get Dangerous!</a>: that pride was almost all justified, when he actually took problems seriously.
</li><li> Finally, Baloo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em> was a kind and heroic figure in the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of the three, but cripplingly lazy, constantly causing himself and others problems by being short-sighted and looking for quick ways out. Rebecca is arguably even closer to the trope than Baloo. Her more educated, ambitious, and hard-working nature brought new life to his all-but-dead cargo business, but also caused new problems due to being overzealous and stubborn once she's chosen a particular plan of action. Contrast to Shere Khan, who is ruthless to the point of near-criminality in his business dealings, with the only redeeming quality being he has enough personal power to crush you <em>above board</em>.
</li><li> All three were accompanied by child sidekicks who existed largely to tell their caretakers when the vice was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">getting out of hand</a>, and to create trouble through their own vice (overwhelming curiosity in all cases) which brought out the protagonist's moments of clarity.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em> has even more of a cast of these. Scrooge has his miserly traits and his 'kind' traits evened out a little. Donald is a loving father figure to his triplet nephews, but is pretty overprotective of them and he still has his Wrath (on the upside, he's specifically noted as having learned to channel it into his protective instincts for the boys). The nephews EACH have their own flaws; Huey is a stickler for the rules to the point where he either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParalysisByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParalysisByAnalysis">freezes up</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">freaks out</a> when he's pushed too far outside his comfort zone. Dewey is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">extremely impulsive</a> to the point where he often endangers himself and others and is a major attention seeker. Louie is a greedy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Lazy Bum</a> who inherited his great-uncle's obsession with money, and isn't above lying to others to get what he wants. Even Gyro Gearloose has a vice of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">not-entirely-deserved arrogance</a>.
</li><li> Gwizdo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonHunters">Dragon Hunters</a></em> usually haggles with desperate villagers over the price of the Hunters' services or actually tries to swindle them. However, his schemes either go wrong or his good nature prevails, effectively preventing the team from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">getting rich and settling down</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>:

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>
<ul><li> Rarity is vain, very concerned about outer appearances and superficially impressing people, and neurotically concerned with cleanliness to the point that it limits her. Yet, like all the other main characters, she's willing to do almost anything if it's obvious it's right or her friends need it. Besides, her concern with appearances is not just superficial or selfish, as it's an artistic career for her, and she's always willing to help others look fabulous as well.
</li><li> Rainbow Dash is insensitive and overconfident, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">lazy</a> on top of that. She normally doesn't really stop to consider how her actions or words affect others. In spite of their different styles, she's also like Rarity in going rather far in wanting to be admired; both have had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">Acquired Situational Narcissism</a> episodes. But, again much like Rarity, she'll put her friends first when the chips are really down, and her brashness extends to being brave and heroic.

She'll do virtually anything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>, figuring she can handle it and that she can still learn something from a disaster. She doesn't care how any of her discoveries might be used, either, as long as she can make them. The only prospect that even gives her pause is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> complete planetary annihilation.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Homer Simpsons is an alcoholic, temperamental, lazy, glutton. But his heart is in the right place, and he'll go to incredible lengths to protect his family.
</li><li> Marge is normally a loving wife and mother, but suffers from a gambling addiction, which can occasionally pop up every now and then. More commonly she is also something of a finicky wet blanket, often unwilling to break from her standard comfort zone, which can make her rather overbearing and humourless. It says something that as often as the kids feel more comfortable around Marge than Homer, they actually find the latter's antics more tolerable than her fussy moods.
</li><li> Lisa is intellectually gifted, philosophical and compassionate, and all at the age of eight years old. Perhaps because of the awareness of her gifts however, she can sometimes be incredibly egomaniacal and self righteous, with an over insistence on being the centre of attention and pushing her beliefs down others' throats, and often insensitively dismissing others as stupider or less significant than her.
</li></ul></li><li> The heroic hedgehog siblings on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicUnderground">Sonic Underground</a></em> each have their own short-comings: Sonic is the bravest of the three, and therefore the most brash. Sonia is whiny and overly-concerned with petty things like dirt and dust, but has a host of technical and social abilities to make up for it. Manic, meanwhile, struggles with the kleptomaniac impulses he learned growing up (he was raised by a thief), but otherwise is the most laid-back and approachable of the bunch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mr. Krabs used to be this fairly consistently but has since been reduced to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> starting around season 4-5, but may qualify in a few of the post movie episodes, such as "Kracked Krabs".
</li><li> Sandy is arguably the one character who has maintained this trait. She is a scientific genius, physically robust to superhuman levels and thoroughly optimistic and friendly on top of that. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">perhaps because of her many strengths and talents</a>, she often displays an ego problem, which can lead her to be very aggressive and competitive when someone challenges her.

As Sir Topham Hatt constantly emphasizes, all of his engines are "really useful" and competent at their specific job on his railway, but nearly each and every one has a heavy shortcoming that causes problems and hinders their work. Thomas for example is optimistic and altruistic, but is also impatient and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOhShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOhShiny">easily forgets his duties</a> to focus on some task he finds more important. James meanwhile (though originally more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>) is an extremely headstrong mixed traffic engine, making him versatile for numerous tasks, but sometimes unwilling or easily distracted due to his vanity.

Luckily, they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondHisYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondHisYears">Otto</a> to keep them in line.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sunstreaker is as brave and heroic as any of the Autobots, but his defining characteristic is his ego. Powerglide and Sky Lynx have hefty egos as well, but they're generally less obnoxious about it than Sunstreaker. Tracks, on the other hand, has a heftier ego and is <em>more</em> obnoxious about it...
</li><li> The Dinobots all have anger and self-control issues, but this just makes them seem childlike and therefore comes across as endearing. Unless you're a Decepticon, then it's scary.
</li><li> Blurr has a problem with impatience.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Rattrap</a> is insubordinate, cowardly (though less so than he may appear), sleazy, and obnoxious enough to irritate all of his comrades. When the chips are down, though, he's as much a hero as any other Maximal. He'll rush in to save the day, guns blazing... and complaining all the while.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Thaddeus Venture of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, despite being mostly portrayed as a cynical, emotionally crippled, amoral slime ball, does occasionally show that deep down he is a decent human being, major examples including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> stopping Brock from murdering his brother at the end of season one, refusing to become the super villain Dr. Killinger had been grooming him to become in season three, and again in season three when he decides to study the super powerful ORB rather than use it for his own personal gain</span>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">But then again we are talking about a man</a> who creates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">the Joycan, a fully interactive virtual environment</a> powered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">the heart of a dead orphan</a>, resurrects dead people to make them into suicide bombers- (note that said resurrectees are not mindless zombies) and orders his bodyguard to go kill people so he has more corpses to make said Suicide Bomber Zombies. Dr. Venture's decent and humane moments are few and far between.
<ul><li> Keep in mind, too, that one of the overreaching arcs of the show has been the slow redemption of dear old Rusty. The first season featured loads of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> moments for him, but these have toned down as time went on. By season 3, he's just more of an insensitve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, with his 'worst' crime that season probably being when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">covered up the death of one of his daycamp kids with a sloppily made clone made from DNA in the dead kid's shoe</span>. Better than the Joycan, at least.
</li><li> And he cured some genetic diseases the kid had, too.
</li></ul></li><li> Now Brock Sampson on the other hand is closer to an unambiguous example... he definitely puts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">heroic in "heroic" and the sociopath in "sociopath"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Ruel Stroud in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> is a treasure-hunter with an obvious attachment to money, but when his traveling companions are in danger (especially his best friend's adoptive son) he'll rush to their defense.
