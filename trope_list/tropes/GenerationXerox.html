But this is getting <em>silly</em>.
</p><p>You see, not only has our hero discovered his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">Secret Legacy</a> and realized that, due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">Superpowerful Genetics</a>, he has inherited all of Mom and Dad's abilities (including the ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">courtesy of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas</a>)... he's found out that he's destined/doomed to live out a replay of their lives.
</p><p>This trope takes "following in your parent's footsteps" to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">a whole new level</a>. The character hasn't just inherited their parents' character traits and superpowers — they've inherited their entire life story.
</p><p>They will meet the same people their parents met, or, if this isn't possible, they will have an equivalent. If Mandy's best friend when she was a child was Polly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie">Soap Box Sadie</a>, her daughter Mindy will befriend Paula the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie">Soap Box Sadie</a> on her first day of school. Sometimes it's just a coincidence, where the child seems to gravitate towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather">same type of people</a> as their mom and dad were drawn to, but often the new associate will have some direct tie to the parent's past (e.g. is the daughter of someone that knew the character's mom).

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeDevices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarrativeDevices">many plotlines</a>, however, the outcome will change at the last moment since the hero(ine) has heard the story from their parents and has had the time to work out what went wrong and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">worked up the guts to change it.</a> For example, if the hero's dad fell out with his best friend because neither would apologize to the other, the hero will figure out that saying sorry is the best way to keep his own friendship going.

If the parents send the kid to the same school as they themselves went to, then it's not such a stretch to believe that the son or daughter will encounter the same people. If the parents kept in touch with their old friends, it's not unlikely that the child will befriend the children of those friends. However, if the parents moved to a different country, assumed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">secret identities</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">tried to forget the past</a>, only to have Junior come home from his first day of school announcing that his dad's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">right-hand man</a> is his English teacher... that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">a bit more of a stretch</a>.

Yup, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> was hereditary too. Better get to work figuring out just <em>how</em> they screwed things up because if you don't, chances are the same tragedy's going to happen again.

It's surprising then, when a short story reveals that D's dad was much like his son when he was younger, to the point he even had a "Leon" of his own in the form of Vesca Howell — a loud-mouthed and brash best friend who he was exceedingly fond of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but whom he ultimately abandoned, just as D abandoned Leon at the end of <em>Petshop</em></span>. The elder D's later "madness", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the fact that he and Howell were eventually responsible for each other's deaths</span>, doesn't bode well for his son, especially given the "Count D" family's odd connection to karma.

</li><li> As much as Tomoya Okazaki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a></em> hates his father for neglecting him to dull the pain of his mother's death, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he has become exactly the same to his own little girl Ushio to forget that her birth killed Nagisa. Thankfully, both cases get better. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">And worse.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">And better, again</a></span>.

</li><li> One of the themes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> is the recurrence of certain characters, traits, and patterns across the generations.
<ul><li> Team 7's relations and characteristics are a dead ringer for those of the Legendary Sannin. This was one reason many fans were able to pick up on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">Luke, I Am Your Father</a> revelation long before it was revealed in canon.
</li><li> As a matter of fact, the relationship between Naruto and his friend/rival Sasuke works as this across multiple generations, dating all the way back to the very <em>invention of ninjutsu</em>.
</li><li> There's now an explanation for the phenomenon. It turns out that even after the sons of the Sage of the Six Paths died, their chakra kept reincarnating into their descendants again and again for generations to continue their feud. And before Naruto/Sasuke, the previous vessels were Hashirama/Madara.
</li><li> There's also Team Minato in regards to Team 7, with Minato/Kakashi as the mentor, Obito/Naruto as the brash, hot-headed one with a one-sided crush on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">The Chick</a>, Rin/Sakura as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a> with a crush on the genius <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Lancer</a>, and finally young Kakashi/Sasuke who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>. Though this particular generation is inverted in that that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Obito</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">who ended up being the bad guy</a> and Kakashi being the hero.
<ul><li> To further deepen the parallels between Team Minato and Team 7, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kakashi ended up becoming Hokage, just like his sensei did. Though it's also inverted in regards to their respective teams, as Naruto, Obito's counterpart, is the one who became Hokage — then again, it was <em>also</em> Obito's dream, at least until he became evil. Then Obito became good again, and knowing that he could no longer achieve that dream after all the damage he had done, passed it on to his best friend Kakashi to fulfill</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Team Ame might count too. Yahiko/Naruto as the brash, hot-headed one and underdog, Konan/Sakura as the "smart" one of the three, Nagato/Sasuke as the Genius and most talented of the three. There's also hints of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> going on but was resolved peacefully.
</li><li> Part of the drama/storyline is that Generation Xerox is present, but also a curse of types. Sasuke is the biggest example/offender that he seems like silly putty. Is he going to be a copy of Kakashi, Orochimaru, Itachi, Obito, or Madara?
</li><li> While Naruto inherited one of his father's signature techniques, it's really his mother whom he takes after the most: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a>, addicted to ramen, similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tics</a> (his "dattebayo" vs. her "dattebane"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Jinchuuriki for the nine-tailed fox</a>, etc..
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the epilogue, his own <em>son</em> is shown to take after him, both in appearance and personality. Boruto is every bit the prankster his father and his sensei, Konohamaru, were as kids. He even has a similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a> ("dattebasa"). The difference is that Boruto is shown to <em>hate</em> the Hokage, as the position means his father can't spend more time with him. Meanwhile, his sister Himawari is shown to take after their mother, Hinata, though both children inherited their father's facial markings.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Boruto's similarity to Naruto is played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BorutoNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BorutoNarutoTheMovie">Boruto: Naruto the Movie</a></em>. Their differences in personality help drive much of the plot. For example, Naruto earned his current place through hard work, training, and determination; Boruto, born a prodigy and connected to very powerful clans, is more than willing to take shortcuts or straight-up cheat his way to victory. Even the animation plays with this a bit: despite his great likeness to Naruto, there's a certain softness to his facial features that make him similar to Hinata when the two are compared</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeFatherLikeSon">Like Father, Like Son</a> mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsInTheFamily">It Runs in the Family</a>, since in his own youth, Naruto bore a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">strong resemblance</a> to his father but had his mother's face.

</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> features a duel between Yugi and a girl named Rebecca, who accuses Yugi's grandfather of stealing his Blue-Eyes White Dragon card from her grandfather. The duel ends up mirroring exactly a duel between the two grandfathers held in a caved-in archaeological site, with the last bit of water on the line. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both Yugi and his grandfather ended up surrendering their duels even though they would have won with their last card draw.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted: The exploits of Luffy are implied to very closely mirror those of Gold Roger, the previous Pirate King; he also meets quite a few people who personally knew the guy (either that, or the successor of said person), and his actions are consistently described by these people as being exactly what Roger would do. However, it's pretty clear right from the start that Roger isn't Luffy's father, and it's outright confirmed later on. But the <em>real</em> kicker came in fairly recently: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Roger actually did have a son: <em>Ace</em>, Luffy's older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBrothers">"brother,"</a> who absolutely <em>despises</em> the guy and wants nothing to do with him. And is now dead. Also subverted in that, according to Whitebeard (who was Roger's rival), Ace wasn't much like his father in terms of personality</span>.
</li><li> Luffy is looking to be this way with Shanks, sharing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> and later in a bar scene with Bellamy, he refuses to fight until his friends are harmed much like his idol.
</li><li> In another chapter, it is revealed a young Gold Roger looked <em>exactly</em> like Luffy, right down to the trademark hat. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Which was passed down from Roger to Shanks to Luffy.</span>
</li><li> Roger and Rayleigh's first meeting (particularly in the anime) has parallels to Luffy and Zoro's first meeting. Roger wanted Rayleigh to join him with Rayleigh refusing. And the boat they started with was a small one.
</li><li> Franky and Iceburg's adoptive father built the Oro Jackson, the ship that Gold Roger used to conquer the Grand Line. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After Going Merry's death, Franky and Iceburg would be the ones to build the Thousand Sunny for the Straw Hats.</span>
</li><li> Robin is an archaeologist like her mother, can read Poneglyphs like her mother, and even <em>looks</em> just like her mother, safe for the hair, which is <em>black</em>.
</li><li> Most of the Straw Hats can easily be compared to one or more of an older generation, either ability-wise or personality-wise. Some to relatives and mentors, others are completely by chance:
<ul><li> Luffy to Roger (his journey and goals), Shanks (his outlook and beliefs), Garp (his personality) and Dragon (his charisma and willpower).
</li><li> Zoro to Mihawk and Rayleigh - they are all devil fruit-less swordsmen, Zoro shares Mihawk's attitude towards weak opponents, and Rayleigh's relationship with Roger mirrors Zoro's with Luffy.
</li><li> Usopp to Yasopp - he looks identical to his father with exception of his nose and hair, Yasopp hasn't been given enough screen time to say anything for personality. Yasopp has the same role in Shanks' crew as Usopp has in Luffy's.
</li><li> Sanji to Zeff - his mentor, also a master chef who dreamed of All Blue and fought by kicking.
</li><li> Chopper to Hiluluk - his "father," a doctor with faith in miracles, who wanted to cure all diseases.
</li><li> Robin to her mother, Olvia, as stated above.
</li><li> Franky's relationship to Luffy can be compared to his mentor Tom's relationship with Roger. Lines can also be drawn to the set of Vegapunk and Kuma - Vegapunk is a genius inventor of whom Franky <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">adopted the designs of during the time-skip,</span> and Kuma is a cyborg built by Vegapunk - much like Franky is a cyborg built by himself.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Toy Soldier/Kyros and his daughter Rebecca</span> are both gladiators with exceptional skill but are widely hated by the audience, though in both cases, said audience eventually got over their hatred of them and came to like them. On the same topic, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rebecca also threw her status as princess away to live with Kyros, just like her mother Scarlett before her. This was even lampshaded by King Riku, Rebecca's grandfather</span>.
</li><li> Luffy's relationship with Smoker is a near carbon copy of Roger's relationship with, ironically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garp, Luffy's grandfather</span>. By the time Roger died, he and his marine nemesis were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a> (even if said nemesis would never admit it), and Roger trusted him as much as he did his own crew. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So much so that Roger entrusted Garp with the life of his unborn child, Ace</span>. Luffy's relationship with Smoker is very much the same, having been forced into several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> situations over the course of the series. By the end of the latest one, their interactions border on that between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">friends</a> (even if Smoker will be back to chasing Luffy around by the next time they meet).
</li></ul></li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>, ends with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

This scene is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">not popular with the fans</a>, though that's mainly for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">shipping-related</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">reasons.</a>
</li><li> Rapidly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, which has the earnest, 10-year-old genius mage Negi following in the footsteps of his hugely-famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>, the "Thousand Master" Nagi... Only later Nagi is shown to be a laidback magic school dropout who, although quite powerful, had to read spells off of a card and resorted to cheap tricks whenever possible (like, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">luring a certain vampire into a covered hole in the ground</a>). In power and personality, they're completely different, and Negi increases the divide even further by choosing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the powers of darkness</span>.
<ul><li> That all said <em>many</em> comparisons can be made between generations, and grow with each revelation: Negi=Nagi, Kotarou=Jack Rakan, Setsuna=Eishun, and of course Ala Alba=Ala Rubra. For that matter, Albrieo Imma is rather mischievous and the team healer, like Konoka. And with the Nagi calling the Zect his "master" recalls Eva.
<ul><li> In Chapter 258 Rakan's flashback confirms above, and also shows that there is a sticking resemblance between the relationship that Negi's parents had and the one he shares with his partner, Asuna. Of course, this is only in reference to their relationships, as the personalities of the parties involved are sometimes totally opposite.
</li><li> Also it seems that for all their differences Negi and Nagi have the same goals and priorities (namely saving Asuna and the world while they are at it) the difference is their approach to this (Nagi "beat the guys who threaten them" vs Negi's "eliminate the villains <em>reason</em> for threatening them")
</li><li> To further hammer the point in, the ships used by Ala Alba and Ala Rubra look remarkably similar (similar enough to <em>possibly be the same ship</em>, even). Compare <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/mahou_sensei_negima/v32/c286/6.html">this shot of the Great Paru-sama<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/mahou_sensei_negima/v30/c268/3.html">the two shots of Ala Rubra's "old ship"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/mahou_sensei_negima/v30/c268/4.html">towards the bottom of these two pages<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Pretty much the biggest difference is that Charles kills V.V upon finding out, while Lelouch doesn't kill Rolo to further his plans — which leads to Rolo pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> for him</span>.
</li><li> <em>Geass</em> contains another, more layered example: Lelouch tells Suzaku that despite the difference in their social status, they can still be friends, citing the example of the first Britannian Emperor and the original Knight of One, who were also lifelong friends (as detailed in the history lessons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">in the DVD inserts</a>).

Even worse, Asahi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Granddaughter from the Future</a> subsequently tells him that history <em>did</em> repeat, with Youko going berserk like her father and disappearing forever; the final arcs of the series are dedicated to the cast doing everything they can to prevent the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> despite being told that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>.</span>

Karen and Genjirou even found out each other's secrets in exactly the same way Youko and Nagisa did.

He shows the authors his family tree, which is full of similar identical descendants who were all great warriors in different eras of French history, including a knight who fought the English at the Battle of Hastings, a Crusader, a privateer, a Napoleonic ship captain, and so on. Several of the bits of history about these descendants include cameos from the descendants of the pirate characters who routinely appear.
<ul><li> Asterix and Obelix also both look a lot like their fathers.
</li></ul></li><li> Captain Haddock in "Tintin" looks very much like his 17th-century ancestor, François de Hadoque. Their personalities are much alike too, both of them being hot-blooded alcoholic seafarers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Viz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Viz">Viz</a> features Biffa Bacon, who is a bully, but who himself is bullied by his parents constantly, and occasionally his uncle too. The character was based on a father joining in a fight their son was having with someone (it was never clear whether what this person had done to make the person fight them, or if it was a random assault).
</li><li> Ulysses Klaw and his father, Fritz Klaue. Both men are obsessed with vibranium, both tried (unsuccessfully) to overthrow Wakanda, and both lost a hand only to have it replaced with a high-tech prosthesis.
</li><li> Baron Heinrich Zemo and his son, Baron Helmut Zemo, right down to their faces being disfigured at the hands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>.

Harbin's tale is used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book End</a> to parallel Helmut's own fall from grace.
</li><li> Used (and to an extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a>) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy2011">Superboy</a></em> run, when Conner was living in Smallville with the Kents in a deliberate attempt to duplicate Clark's childhood.

(Both of these have twists—Simon Valentine never actually turned evil that we saw, and Lori <em>did</em> discover Conner's secret ... oh, and she's Luthor's niece.)
</li><li> A very simple example in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lanterns</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">Flashes</a> of the DC Universe, who are always friends. Alan Scott and Jay Garrick from the Golden Age, Hal Jordan and Barry Allen of the Silver Age, and Kyle Rayner and Wally West from the modern age. Jesse Quick and Jade, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to Flash and Lantern respectfully, are also shown as pretty close friends when the two are on the Justice League together.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMultiversity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMultiversity">The Multiversity</a></em>, there's an alternate universe where that Earth's Green Lantern and Flash analogues are lovers.
</li><li> This also extends to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrows</a> and Green Lanterns, with Oliver Queen regularly teaming up with Hal, and his successor Connor Hawke doing the same with Kyle Rayner.
</li><li> Similar to the Green Lanterns and Flashes above, there's the Batman family and the Flashes. Every generation that has both a male Bat-character and a Flash will end up being close friends. Bruce Wayne and Barry Allen are close friends because of their shared interest in science and dead parents<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16hw7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16hw7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16hw7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this one is mostly via retcon, though, as before Barry died he was no closer to Batman than anyone else in the League and was only similar based on their shared scientific interest, as Barry's parents were both alive</span>, Dick Grayson and Wally West are best friends and grew up together, and Tim Drake and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Impulse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Impulse">Bart Allen</a> are best friends.
<ul><li> Then, to a lesser extent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> is good friends and teammates to Barry and Bruce, founding the Justice League together. Diana's sister and former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a> Donna Troy grew up together with Wally and Dick in the Teen Titans and sees them as like her brothers. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a> Cassie Sandsmark did the same with Bart and Tim in Young Justice, and even briefly dated Tim.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Outside of their friendships and what-have-you, The Flash maintains a few odd similarities in each generation, despite not being blood-related. Jay Garrick was a scientist and had a sense of humor. Barry Allen was also a scientist, though lacked the sense of humor; Wally West lacked the scientist (though he was a rationalist who had some interest in the field, but never studied it), but he very much had the sense of humor. Bart Allen's scientific knowledge is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, but he was easily the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified">Fun Personified</a> of the Flash fam. Both Barry and Wally also married reporters, Barry dating Iris West (and through her met and mentored Wally), while Wally married Linda Park, and both couples had twins (Don and Dawn Allen, 'the Tornado Twins', and Irey and Jai Park-West).
</li><li> The pre-Crisis and post-Crisis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a> are mother and daughter. They're both named "Dinah", both wear more-or-less the same superhero costume, both use the same superhero alias, and both have black hair naturally. The main difference is the modern Canary has her Canary Cry powers while her mom was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>. (Out of universe, the reason is that they were the exact same person before being hastily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retconned</a> into two when it created a continuity issue.)
</li><li> Gus McGogan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmericanVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmericanVampire">American Vampire</a></em> mirrors his father Cash in the most tragic way: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both were orphaned at early age, both were unwanted children until someone nice enough adopted them</span>. Gus is also a vampire, just like his adoptive grandfather and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">namesake</a>, though the difference is that Gus the elder was a Gaelic vampire, while the younger is an American Vampire.

Occasionally the kids will have certain aspects of their grandparents if they showed up in the series and they were likable enough. When you get right down to it, many of these "original characters" are the same damn people and the only difference will depend on what the writer's favorite name is.
<ul><li> And while we're on the subject, this leaches into the shipping as well. For example, if the writer is a Harry/Draco fan, this will come across/feature in an Al/Scorpius fic. Same goes for Rose/Scorpius = Hermione/Draco, among others.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Skywalker twins resemble the same-sex parents in terms of looks and career choice, but their personalities and temperaments are more reminiscent of the opposite-sex ones. Luke, like Padme, grows to see the good in Vader and show compassion for everyone. Leia, like Anakin, is strong-willed and not as forgiving, as well as being quite the snappy snarker.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens">The Force Awakens</a></em>, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the villainous Kylo Ren is actually Ben, Anakin's grandson. Like Anakin, he was seduced by the Dark Side of the Force and slaughtered his fellow Jedi, and wears a black outfit complete with a mask. This is actually intentional, as Ben consciously models himself after Darth Vader, whom he idolizes to a truly unhealthy degree</span>.
</li><li> Many jokes have been made about how whiny and angsty the Skywalker men are (especially in comparison to the Skywalker women), although Luke arguably grows out of it. This trait is even observable in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kylo Ren</span>.
</li><li> Arguably taken a step further in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">the old Expanded Universe</a>, in which Luke decides there's no such thing as a 'light side' and 'dark side', only the Force, henceforth using the force entirely as he sees fit. Later, after a certain incident, he comes to the rapid conclusion that he's made a terrible mistake, and cuts himself off from the unsavory elements of the Force. In some ways, reflecting how Anakin came to embrace the Dark Side, only to repent and slay the Emperor. Anakin's grandson follows exactly the same path as Vader, all the while ironically looking back at history so he did not make the same mistakes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">which he did</a>. The conclusion was arguably inverted as he ended up not repenting before his death.
<ul><li> It depends on what you qualify as "repenting". Moments before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his sister Jaina</span> kills him, he seems to realize that he was as much of an idiot as his grandfather was. Unfortunately, he only realizes this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at about the same time he's stabbed through the chest because he had left himself open while sending a psychic message to his former lover that their daughter's life was in danger</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungJediKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungJediKnights">Young Jedi Knights</a></em> series, Jaina is described as looking a lot like Leia, but her personality more resembles Han. Leia, meanwhile, shares her mother's affection for interesting hair arrangements.
</li></ul></li><li> Luke Skywalker's eventual wife Mara Jade was once one of his greatest enemies (she once served as Emperor Palpatine's Hand) until they fell in love and got married. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FateOfTheJedi">Fate of the Jedi</a></em>, Luke's son Ben Skywalker fights Sith Lady Vestara Khai several times and then a mutual attraction begins. Luke lampshades the parallel.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MammaMia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MammaMia">Mamma Mia!</a></em> has a mild version: Sophie's relationship with her best friends Ali and Lisa is identical to that of her mother Donna and <em>her</em> best friends Tanya and Rosie - both groups have their own friendship chants and the similarity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in a later scene when both groups unwittingly have a near identical conversation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDuchess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDuchess">The Duchess</a></em> seems to be a determined attempt to present the life of Georgina, Duchess of Devonshire, as a foreshadowing of her collateral descendant Diana, Princess of Wales.

</li><li> Surprisingly this is inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigBully">Big Bully</a></em> where the main character returns to work at his old high school with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolyardBullyAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolyardBullyAllGrownUp">Schoolyard Bully All Grown Up</a>. Both of them now have sons the same age but the victim's son is a violent and mean child and picks on the bully kid who is a nice and kind boy. The main character is actually seen bonding with his former tormentor's son over their shared experience with bullies.
<ul><li> <em>Big Bully</em> is pretty much a deconstruction of the "schoolyard bully" stereotype. In keeping with this, the inversion continues with the kids <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> realizing the benefit in one another's company and becoming friends.</span> When the dads realize this at the end of the film, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they decide to put their own past behind them and follow their kids' example.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In Korean film <em>The Classic</em>, the parallels between the daughter and her mother (whose story is told in flashbacks) are very similar. Both of them meet a boy and when it began to rain, the two couples happen to run under the same tree for shelter. And both couples meet hardships in the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> and an annoying friend who interferes with their relationships.

Pumpkin became bitter and hateful like Hatsumomo, degrading herself, holding a grudge against Sayuri for ruining her future. Sayuri, on the other hand, became like Mameha, successful and was able to survive the worst of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> and still maintain the gracefulness that they once had when they were prosperous.

They're both archaeology professors, they're obsessed with antiquities, they're ladies' menin one case, its even the same lady, they both wear a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">Nice Hat</a> (Indy's iconic fedora and Henry's bucket hat) and carry a surprisingly useful tool (Indy's whip and Henry's umbrella), and they're both pretty useful in a crisis.

The main difference between them is that unlike his son, Henry doesn't have a costumed secret identity and doesn't seek out dangerous adventures or occult villains.

As noted by the professor, who is entering his sixty-fourth year and has been married to the love of his life for ten years, "while it is quite nice to know that I will live sixty-four years, it is quite annoying to know that I won't go any further".

Admittedly, he starts out with an interest in his grandfather's work, but that doesn't explain all of it, and certainly not why his capitalist venture partner just happens to be descended from a member of the original Bob Shaftoe's brother's pirate crew (as, incidentally, is Goto Dengo, one of a handful of characters to appear in the 1940s and 1990s sequences of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a></em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, this cuts both ways. Harry's father and his cohorts from their days at Hogwarts, the Marauders, map well onto Harry and <em>his</em> friends — and he meets every single one of them before the end of the third book. And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "first day at Hogwarts" at the end of <em>Deathly Hallows</em> is a dead ringer for Harry's own "first day" way back in <em>Philosopher's Stone</em>. This is emphasized when Harry's daughter Lily whines that she wants to go to Hogwarts <em>now</em> to her mother, Ginny, said the same thing six books earlier</span>.
<ul><li> This is also subverted to an extent with Harry's father — Harry unthinkingly assumes that their characters were xeroxed until Harry's father James turns out to have been a pampered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> in his teenage years, properly maturing only in the last year or two of school. It's implied that Harry's unhappy upbringing has made him a better person in some respects. Dumbledore also comments to Snape he finds Harry's personality much like his mother's, rather than his father's.
<ul><li> Harry is constantly described as looking exactly like his father, except that he has his mother's green eyes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Harry actually gets a look of what James looked at his own age, due to reading Snape's memories, he notices that looking at his father's face is much like staring into an uncanny mirror. It looks almost the same, but some details are just slightly <em>off</em>.</span>
</li><li> Also, both Harry and James fall in love with and marry a red-haired woman, making both couples very alike in looks. Although this is subverted because Harry is a half-blood whose wife Ginny is a pureblood, while James was a pureblood whose wife Lily was muggle-born.
</li><li> Also the situation of an orphaned godson is repeated. The books start out with Harry, an orphan, living with his relatives. He grows very close to his godfather, Sirius. The books end with Teddy Lupin, an orphan, living with his relatives. Jo tells us he becomes very close to his godfather, Harry.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Draco Malfoy</a> plays this trope around across the saga. When we meet his father Lucius it's very much clear that Draco takes after him physically and does everything he can to imitate him, putting on airs with a snobby attitude and looking down on others. However, come <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when he finally joins the Death Eaters and is given the (seemingly) impossible task of assassinating Dumbledore</span>, he starts realizing what it really means to be like his father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">and he does not enjoy it one bit</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HarryPotterAndTheCursedChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/HarryPotterAndTheCursedChild">Many years later</a>, he goes out of his way to defy this trope and raise his son so he doesn't turn out like him or Lucius</span>.

Queen Selenay jokes, not inaccurately, that members of the family who don't inherit the usual resemblance generally find excuses to run off to the capital city. To give one of the more egregious examples: the main characters of the books are identical twin girls with an older brother. Of the past five generations of their mother's family, three have consisted of identical twin girls with an older brother.

Her sister, Prim, looks like Mrs. Everdeen and has inherited her passion for healing. Also, Mrs. Everdeen was close friends with Katniss' friend, Madge's mother, as a teenager and the father of Katniss' love interest Peeta had a crush on Mrs. Everdeen.

Three hundred years later, she meets her descendant, also named Natalie, also working as the receptionist, and looking so alike Azusa thinks she's the same person.
</li><li> A bizarre variant, in which there's no blood relationship, is the "Jack and Susan" mysteries by Michael McDowell. Whether it's 1913, 1933, or 1953 (and McDowell originally intended to write stories for the "_3" year of <em>each</em> decade), Jack Beaumont and Susan Bright are always 27 years old, meeting and falling in love for the first time. No explanation is ever even attempted — this is just the way it happens.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a></em> has a variation on this in that most of the people that the gods possess tend to live variations of the tales of the gods; e.g. Julius Kane (possessed by Osiris) is kidnapped by Set while his children Carter and Sadie Kane are forced to escape (Horus and Isis respectively). Justified in that the gods don't have imagination and can only repeat stories, while humans can change these.

</div><ul><li> Examined by the various members of the Lannister family. Jaime and Cersei both believe themselves to be just like their father. Both claims are refuted by other members of the family. Cersei is considered to be too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">mercurial</a> in comparison to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">rock-solid</a> Tywin by both her brothers. Tywin's sister Genna dismisses Jaime's claim, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavourite">Tyrion</a> is most like Tywin, while noting he <em>does</em> have similarities to most of his uncles.
</li><li> The noble houses in ASOIAF in general work like this, both in appearance (Martin's genetics is... peculiar) and in behavior (nobles are encouraged to imitate their more famous ancestors). One character (Joffrey Baratheon) was even correctly outed as not a real Baratheon by numerous characters, by virtue of him neither looking the part nor acting like how a proper Baratheon acts. By contrast, Robert's bastard children all act in a stubborn manner and have the Baratheon coloring.
</li><li> Robert's brother Stannis has similar qualities to his great-great-grandfather King Maekar I. They were both stern and unforgiving younger sons who are great military men but feel unappreciated, unexpectedly inherit the Iron Throne and both kill a better-liked brother of theirs.
</li><li> Robert's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">bastard son</a> Gendry manages to demonstrate the traits of his father and uncle Stannis, despite not even knowing he's a Baratheon. He's inherited Robert's strength and fondness for a war hammer while being very similar in personality to the serious, honorable and reserved Stannis. He even ends up best friends with Arya Stark — the daughter of <em>Robert's</em> best friend Ned — and is hinted to be developing feelings for her, who (as noted above) is similarly Generation Xerox of Lyanna Stark, the woman Robert spent his life in love with.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh">Sweet Valley Saga</a></em> books rely on the idea that the present inhabitants of Sweet Valley largely are Xeroxed from the ancestors who are the subjects of the books. Patmans and Fowlers are of course in some way derived from nobility, for example.

For instance, the last few ThunderClan leaders have been a series of mentors and their apprentices: Sunstar mentored Bluestar who mentored Firestar who mentored Bramblestar. Hawkfrost tried to take over the Clans like his father Tigerstar and there was a prophecy about the final confrontation that stopped each one. Being the subject of a prophecy and saving the Clans in some way also seems to run in Firestar's bloodline.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Stark children have many similarities with their parents:
<ul><li> Like his father, Robb is a skilled tactician and compassionate leader (both in war and peace) with a sense of duty and honor who rebels against a king in the name of family — fittingly, as he is the heir of Winterfell. Richard Madden even mentions this in Robb's featurette. Though there is one crucial difference that separates them, as pointed out by Catelyn herself: Ned entered into a political marriage during the course of Robert's Rebellion, and honored that vow, refusing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove">Marry for Love</a> even if there might have been another woman in his life (and allegedly the existence of Jon Snow would imply that there was).
</li><li> Jon resembles his father Ned the most out of the Stark children and is a solemn, honorable (and known for this honor), and levelheaded leader and skilled swordsman like Ned, with Ned's sense of duty, compassion and love for family, who carries out executions himself. All of this makes it even more ironic <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because Ned is not his biological father, but his uncle</span>.
</li><li> Sansa is a beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperLady">Proper Lady</a> like her mother Catelyn — a few characters remark that she looks very much like Catelyn did when she was young. Littlefinger even says she's <em>more</em> beautiful than her mother was at that age. Appropriately enough, she gradually starts exhibiting more and more of Catelyn's character traits as she gets older, save for acquiring a cold pragmatism her mother lacked which Sansa likely acquired from her time around the court, particularly around Littlefinger. So, in a way, she became the child Littlefinger never got to have with Cat. This is even more striking in Season 6 as she has now taken over the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConsigliere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConsigliere">The Consigliere</a> to her brother Jon, like Catelyn used to do with her husband Ned and son Robb — Sansa and Jon's father and brother respectively. In regards to her father, despite her earlier infatuation for Joffrey, she has her father's idealism, patience, self-control, compassion and love for her family and home, Winterfell.
</li><li> Arya has her father's grim determination, a fierce sense of justice, and love and empathy for the smallfolk. She also ends up best friends with Gendry during the war - who is the son of Ned's friend Robert who he fought alongside during the last war.
</li><li> Like his father, Bran is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> with an overriding concern for his subjects (literally begging for Ser Rodrik's life) with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel">Nerves of Steel</a>, like Arya his closest allies end up mirroring his fathers, as he befriends the children of Howland Reed, Ned's best friend, and considering his resemblance to Kid!Ned in the flashbacks, probably the child who most closely resembles him physically.
</li><li> Rickon has his father's compassion and love for family.
</li></ul></li><li> Ned comments that Arya takes after Lyanna (Ned's sister) in both appearance and personality. The flashbacks of a young Lyanna show her as a spirited tomboy wearing boy's clothing, befriending small folk and literally riding circles around her brothers — all support Ned's comments about Arya.
</li><li> The Smalljon inherits his father's boastful nature, the size, the massive beard, the temper, and the brutal honesty. He just seems a tad more villainous.
</li><li> Tytos Lannister's trait as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakWilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakWilled">Weak-Willed</a>, indecisive ruler with a strong desire to be liked and easily manipulated by the people around him was inherited by his great-grandson, Tommen.
</li><li> Myrcella looks strikingly like Cersei did when she was young, though thankfully lacks her mother's temperament. By coincidence, the actresses who portray Myrcella and a young Cersei share an uncommon first name.
</li><li> Drogon's features and temperament towards burning people in battle recalls the historical actions of Balerion the Black Dread, Aegon the Conqueror's own dragon. In the books, the coincidence is actually commented upon by Daenerys herself, even believing that Drogon is Balerion reincarnated  even if she gave him a new name to honor his new life.
</li><li> Gendry is tall, strong, and handsome like his father, and his best friend is  just like his father's was  a Stark. Ned even realizes that he's Robert's bastard for certain when he stubbornly insists that his bull helmet's not for sale, even though slighting the Hand of the King could get his tongue ripped out. They also both prefer to use warhammers in combat. That said he's managed to escape on a lot of his father's worst traits such as his bloodthirstiness, arrogance, impulsiveness, and whoring, and is generally much kinder and more serious than Robert ever was.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> universe Dr. Soong was an eccentric scientist, whose work on creating artificial humanoids made him distrusted. One of his more powerful creations turned out to be a conscienceless monster who had to be stopped by the crew of the <em>Enterprise</em>. Another, however, was a good person who aided the <em>Enterprise</em> crew in this. Arik (and Malik and Udar) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> or Noonien (and Lore and Data) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>?

Bashir says he found it too repetitive, citing how the same thing happened to seven generations of Cardassians. Garak simply replies that he considers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationalSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationalSaga">repetitive epic</a> the most elegant form of Cardassian literature.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> They might have got better (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">kind of</a>) but in "Mystery Spot", Dean died and Sam became a ruthless hunter, bent on revenge against Dean's killer. Their mother died (she didn't get better) and their father became a ruthless hunter, bent on revenge against <em>her</em> killer. And yes, it's as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hoyay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hoyay">slashy</a> as it sounds.
</li><li> Sam is John 2.0 Period. (He did a less extreme version of this back in season one after Azazel killed his fiancee, but between having Dean to help him through it and it already being his father's quest, it just wasn't as all-consuming. John appears to have been orphaned even before he married.)
<ul><li> It explains why they didn't get on most of the time, they were just too damn similar.
</li><li> Sammy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">I Just Want to Be Normal</a> also goes back to his mom. The demon deals thing is just a family tradition at this point. They even spread it to the adopted members, and back to people who died before they were born.
</li></ul></li><li> Season five also plays a weird version of it with generation one being God and two of his archangels, and the Xerox being the original Winchester triad. Dean being the 'good son' Michael the soldier, and Sam being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Lucifer</a>, the rebellious one. Gabriel makes this explicit. While at the same time, Castiel's quest for an unanswering God is clearly meant to parallel the original series premise of 'two brothers on a road trip, looking for their father and killing evil things,' with a smidgen more subtlety.
<ul><li> In all cases God is, if not evil, definitely a dick. This is a show that prefers lateral relationships in all cases to vertical ones. Equality fuck yeah.
</li></ul></li><li> In season seven, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Castiel</span> dies, Dean mourns the same way his father mourned his mother: by burying himself in work, drowning himself in alcohol, and becoming obsessed with taking revenge on those he holds responsible for his loss. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And Castiel's death echoes Mary's: both made an impulsive deal with a powerful demon in order to protect the man they loved the most (although Cas had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">other reasons, too</a>), and both paid the price for it.</span>

Dawn's new friends are subsequently forgotten.

In "God's Equation", he comes to feel guilty about all of the terrible things that he has done, something that Owen never does. Mary proves to be cut from the same cloth as her grandfather. Also in "God's Equation", Eric mentions that she possesses the same clarity of purpose as his father, which is probably related to their lack of morals.
</li><li> In "Beyond the Sky", Sally Clarke is a lonely, unhappy woman whose husband Fred neglects and disrespects her. Her children Tom and Becky are her main source of happiness. Her unsatisfactory marriage leads her to have an affair with the alien John. In "Jacob and Jesse", she has a brief relationship with Owen but it turns out that he was merely using her so that he could have an opportunity to kidnap Jacob. In "Maintenance", Becky is married to a man named Ronnie, who treats her in much the same way as Fred treated Sally. Her children Kim and Andy are the only good things to come from her marriage. Becky's unhappy marriage leads her to have an affair with Eric. Becky and Eric's relationship differs from Owen and Sally's in that Eric genuinely develops feelings for her but Becky ends it when she realizes that she doesn't trust him.

The new player character seems to experience a sequence of events extremely similar to ones experienced by the previous player character in the previous game, with note-for-note character analogues and extremely similar level design.

Furthermore, Auron is attempting to subvert this trope because he's seen first-hand that the traditional way of fighting Sin that Braska opted for solves absolutely nothing, and thus he influences Tidus and Yuna to realize that and try to find another way.

All of his descendants followed a similar pattern, but you only get to kick the butts of Yakra I (600 A.D.) and Yakra XIII (1000 A.D., much later in the game).
<ul><li> Marle herself is the spitting image of Queen Leene, to the point that Yakra I (600 A.D.), his army of monsters, and the entire staff and residence of Guardia Castle mistook her for Leene, allowing what would have happened to Leene to happen to Marle instead.

In fact, Echo Ridge looks almost exactly like AC/DC. Though in this case there's no biological connection, it's still one hell of a coincidence that many of the same events played out between two very similar groups of people two hundred years apart.
<ul><li> Specifically, it's Lan and Geo, Bud and Dex, Sonia and Mayl, Luna and Yai, and Zack and Eugene. Though it should be noted that the boys have far more in common with their counterparts than the girls do.
<ul><li> Although there are points where characters mix, such as Sonia being Geo's main backup, while Zack never gets a chance to help. But there are still parallels even then, as characteristics are still taken from the ordinal just being given to other characters, with Harpnote replacing Protoman as the reliable fighter aside from Mega Man.

His descendants (or at least the notable ones) are all addicted to Mana and eventually fall prey to their bloodline's need to seek it, which leads them to duplicate their infamous ancestor's empire and/or gambit for the Mana Tree. At this point, they all usually choose to go by their surname or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">start being referred to like it by those opposing them</a>. Every one of them also seems to have bright red hair and very dark green eyes, and they may or may not be the reincarnations of the original.

Of the first three known characters, two are virtually identical to previous protagonists. The third protagonist, a green haired girl, drove the fandom insane from trying to figure out who she is.
<ul><li> She turned out to be the violet-eyed Wind Adept daughter of the original violet-eyed Wind Adept. Gasp, shock. At least she differs by having a series of healing spells and a more volatile personality.
</li><li> And then along came our fourth party member who, aside from being a boy whose utility spell is Douse instead of Frost, is a <em>perfect clone</em> of the first-gen Water Adept (a point hammered home by his older sister, who differs from Mia only in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">attitude</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlishPigtails">hairstyle</a>).

There are also a lot of identical mailmen - even the <em>bird guy</em> who's a mailman looks less like the other Rito and more like the usual mailman with wings and a funky 'do. That's just a taste; a full list would be endless. And then there are the slight name changes, like Marin and Tarin becoming Malon and Talon but essentially being the same. Other partial examples like the four carpenters (look alike, names change <em>completely</em>) exist.

He explores Lorule, a location similar the Dark World complete with most dungeons having the same names and themes, fights bosses which are the Lorulean counterparts of the ones fought in the Dark World (like Arrghus, Stalblind and Grinexx), goes up against a villain with a similar plan to Agahnim and a design suspiciously like Ghirahim, Chancellor Cole and Ganondorf...

All of the characters in the second half are the children of the characters in the first half, and the female characters all have the same classes as their mothers (well, most of them, anyway—gender inheritance is reversed for Brigid's children and there were extenuating circumstances for Altenna <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kidnapped at a young age, brought up in a foreign land</span> and Nanna <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her mother's class was "Princess", and, well, she kind of abdicated that when she joined Sigurd's army</span>); likewise, Aless and Seliph, whose fathers are <em>not</em> up for interpretation, share a class with said fathers. (You can pair up the other members of your army such that the male children—and Brigid's daughter, Patty—have the same classes as their fathers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing">though you may get some slightly odd results.</a>) Furthermore, it is quite possible by exploiting bugs to pair up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Seliph and Julia</a>, mirroring the romance between Sigurd and Diadora, and the fifth game <em>strongly</em> hints that Leaf and Nanna is more or less canon. As mentioned before, Nanna does not share a class with her own mother; she <em>does</em> have the same class as <em>Leif</em>'s mother, so this would qualify as mirroring the relationship between Leif's parents. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Actually, the same thing sort of applies the other way around, as Leif's class is Prince, which plays out only slightly different than Lachesis's Princess class in that Leif cannot use staves before promoting.</span>)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade">The Binding Blade</a></em> and its prequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">The Blazing Blade</a></em> have this, albeit mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterparts</a>. Many characters who appeared in <em>The Binding Blade</em> had parents who served in <em>The Blazing Blade</em>. And sure enough...they look almost <em>exactly</em> like that one parent. The other parent is left rather open. For example, Roy looks <em>exactly like</em> Eliwood. His mother can be either Lyndis, Ninian <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the half-dragon girl</span> or Fiora. None of which are shown or even <em>mentioned</em> in <em>The Binding Blade</em>, as they were specially created for <em>Blazing Sword</em>. Hector meanwhile has a daughter named Lilina who is pretty much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> of him (He's a fighter, she's a mage) and likewise, <em>her</em> mother is not shown or named. It can be either Lyndis (once more), Florina, or Farina (It is also important to note that Florina, Fiora, and Farina are the Pegasus Sisters in <em>The Blazing Blade</em>). Lugh and Ray are likewise basically Nino if she was genderswapped (Their fathers are either the Assassin Jaffar or the Mage Erk). Sue is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> to Rath, and looks <em>exactly</em> like him if he were a girl; her mother is also not mentioned, but it's possible it was actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lyndis</span> due to one of her endings.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, several characters who have children in <em>The Binding Blade</em> do mention their parents. Fir the Myrmidon is a Generation Xerox of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Lady of War</a> Karla - and the resemblance between her and her uncle Karel (appears in both <em>Binding Blade</em> and <em>Blazing Blade</em>) are also obvious. But who's Fir's father? Well, it's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Boisterous Bruiser</a> Bartre - who actually <em>can join alongside her</em> and is in both <em>Binding Blade and Blazing Blade</em>(Amusingly, if he's defeated in <em>Blazing Blade</em>, Barte actually says "Uh oh, I'll be back when I heal this wound!"). Canas in <em>Blazing Blade</em> also has a son named Hugh in <em>Binding Blade</em>, but he was mentioned as already being born in the former (Canas's mother Niime also joins in <em>Binding Blade</em>).
</li><li> Hugh is actually a massive subversion. Canas is softspoken, a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Cloud Cuckoolander</a> and uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Magic.</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">But don't call it Dark, please</a>). Hugh is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>, can be pretty harsh and uses Anima Magic instead. (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He inherited the magic talents of Canas's wife aka Hugh's <em>mother</em>, strongly hinted in <em>Blazing Blade</em> to be the sister of Nino's murdered biological mom and a member of a powerful mage clan</span>.) Pretty much their only real similarity is their hair color (Though Niime says that Canas might have been a scoundrel when he was younger. Who knows).

He even does the same prank Harry first did to the Hero when he was a kid, this time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to the Hero's children.</span> Not to mention Kendrick shares the same sprite with the young Harry.
<ul><li> In another example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after the Hero's mother Queen Mada was captured by the Evil Order of Zugzwang, King Pankraz leaves his kingdom to go on a journey along with his son and Sancho in order to her after she had given birth to their son the Hero. Later, the Hero pursues the same quest while searching for his wife who was <em>also</em> captured by the Order of Zugzwang, right after giving birth to their son and daughter</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxTheDevilsPlayhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamAndMaxTheDevilsPlayhouse">Sam &amp; Max: The Devil's Playhouse</a></em> stars Sameth and Maximus, the titular duo's great-grandfathers. They look and behave exactly like our heroes, only Sameth has a mustache and Maximus wears clothes.
<ul><li> Except for one thing: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both Sameth and Maximus are killed at the end of their adventure, while only Max is killed at the end of the game (although, Sam is killed in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>, which could make this trope work fully)</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The family of Fungalmancer Glop in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> takes this trope to the most absurd extreme imaginable. Every generation of the Glop family line is <em>identical</em> to the one before, having the same name, same appearance, same occupation, and <em>exact same response when attacked</em>. Taking out the latest Fungalmancer Glop is a daily quest, and the trope is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">so far beyond eleven</a> that you'd think you were killing the same stone trogg every day.
<ul><li> Certain Horde leaders tend to fall victim to this as well. You have Grom Hellscream from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII">Warcraft II</a> : Beyond the Dark Portal</em>, a generally bloodthirsty and hotheaded orc to begin with, dooming his people to slavery via the demon blood because he wanted its power, and eventually had to be taken down by a combined Alliance/Horde force in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a> : Reign Of Chaos</em>. Fast forward to the <em>World of Warcraft</em>, specifically the <em>Burning Crusade</em> expansion, where we meet his son Garrosh, who is fairly youthful but otherwise not particularly aggressive Orc. However, after being told of his father's legacy, begins to take on many of his less-desirable traits, culminating in dooming his people to slavery via the Sha because he wanted its power, and eventually had to be taken down by a combined Alliance/Horde force in <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em> reveals itself to be this in the opening cut scene. Playing the game shows that the kids are apparently more competent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade">Infinity Blade</a></em> has this as a major element of the plot. In the prologue, a warrior ends up being killed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">God King</a>, with the game than showing his son vowing to avenge his father and fighting his way to the God King. Unfortunately, due to inadequate equipment and level-grinding, the warrior ends up getting killed. Years later, <em>his</em> son (who somehow has the same level and equipment of his father when he died) vows to avenge him and fights his way up the tower. Rinse and repeat.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But this is actually subverted because the first novel tie-in and the second game reveals the "son" is the same person as the "father". Whenever the main character dies, he is resurrected years later and has his memories rewritten to believe he is avenging his father's death.</span> Not only that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the novel also reveals the warrior in the prologue is the main character's <em>son</em> who chose to join the God King and gained immortality</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> does this with Dante performing similar actions to his father, Sparda, which in chronological order seems to be showing that Dante surpasses his father over time:
<ul><li> <em>DMC3</em>: Sparda sealed Temen-ni-gru, Dante fights demons there but the tower's fate is never gone into.
</li><li> <em>DMC1</em>: Sparda defeated Mundus as does Dante.
</li><li> <em>DMC4</em>: Sparda sealed the Hell Gates, Dante destroys them.
</li><li> <em>DMC2</em>: Sparda defeated Argosax, Dante kills him.
</li><li> There's also the fact that Dante wields his father's main sword in <em>DMC1</em> and one he inherited from him in all the other games. He also uses the one his brother inherited in <em>DMC4</em>.
</li><li> And Nero with his father Vergil as both use Yamato and Summoned Swords and come into conflict with Dante (and beat him the first time).
</li></ul></li><li> A comment made by Palmer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokemon Platinum</a></em> implies this. He says him and the protagonist's father were childhood friends who got their first Pokemon similarly to you and your rival.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingSaGa2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingSaGa2">Romancing SaGa 2</a></em> is this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. The game runs on generations system, but except for Leon, Victor, Gellard, and the Final Emperor/Empress, there will always be the same lines of characters available to provide you quests and similar recruitable characters with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> to fill your class rosters no matter how many hundred years have passed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone">Hearthstone</a></em> has Cairne Bloodhoof, who, when killed, is replaced with his son Baine. This trope applies in that the two of them are statistically identical.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaAndTheFortressOfDoom">Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom</a></em> and its sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheLegendReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LufiaTheLegendReturns">Lufia: The Legend Returns</a></em>, feature the same premise, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReincarnationRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReincarnationRomance">Reincarnation Romance</a> and heroes gathering journey to slay four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> with a magic sword wieldable only by the descendant of the legendary hero Maxim.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation">Alien: Isolation</a></em>, a grown-up Amanda Ripley goes in search of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alien">her lost mother Ellen</a>, and through the game ends up going through a number of the same situations her mother did way back in the original 1979 movie.
</li><li> An example shows up between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TravisStrikesAgainNoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TravisStrikesAgainNoMoreHeroes">Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes</a></em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BetterDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BetterDays">Better Days</a></em> actually has a chapter called "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.jaynaylor.com/betterdays/archives/chapter-21-fath/">Father's Footsteps<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>." Which reveals that the stories told to Fisk of his father's life were a lie. Instead of the honorable war hero he had believed his father to be, Jim was actually a hitman working for a secret underground operation who fought terrorists on a "more direct front" to defend the U.S., using Vietnam as his cover. One of the characters who explain this met Fisk in his adolescence earlier in the comic and was Jim's friend. Aside from one question accompanied by a frown, Fisk doesn't seem at all angered, dismayed, or even shocked by this groundbreaking discovery. He of course hastily agrees to begin training for this new venture even though Beth was expecting him to come live with her and lead a more domestic life once his army contract expired.
</li><li> Surma sends her daughter Antimony to the same school as she herself attended — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GunnerkriggCourt">Gunnerkrigg Court</a></em>. It seems as if Annie's parents were the only members of that generation who moved away from the court, since Annie runs into most of her parents' social circle (who are now teachers), befriending the daughter (Kat) of Surma's friends. She also meets another acquaintance of Surma's — Reynardine. Instead of walking up to her and saying "Hello, I knew your mum," however, Reynardine comes crashing through Annie's ceiling — and she's the only student in the <em>entire dorm</em> to see him.
<ul><li> Given her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">Secret Legacy</a>, it also appears that Annie is destined to acquire Surma's role in the Court, as well as her powers.
<ul><li> One flashback has shown that Surma, who looks <em>exactly</em> like an older Annie, appeared to have had an almost identical relationship to Kat's mother as Annie has to Kat.
</li><li> As it turns out, in Antimony's case at least there's a <em>very</em> good reason for this.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>, this is happening on two different levels one with the previous generation and two hundred years ago.

(Though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to date the only place that "Ogglespoon" has been mentioned is in an opera whose relationship to actual history is very much open to question, and may even have been revived as explicit anti-Wulfenbach propaganda</span>.)

One is morally ambiguous and quite willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KicktheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KicktheDog">Kickthe Dog</a>, the other is a more outwardly heroic man who loses it when it's believed that she is dead.

This is impressive because they last saw each other when he was in kindergarten. Meanwhile, he's dating a woman as controlling and evil as his mother (slightly less cruel, but more interested in exterminating humanity).
<ul><li> Not anymore. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oasis killed her.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>, this trope is built into Alternian society itself. Although thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienReproduction">Bizarre Alien Reproduction</a> trolls don't have parents in any conventional sense, they have "<a class="urllink" href="http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Ancestors">ancestors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" - trolls from the past with the same blood color and symbol. Young trolls are then encouraged to seek out information about their ancestors and follow in their footsteps; even if they don't, their personalities and roles in society wind up being eerily similar.
<ul><li> A bizarre semi-example shows up in Act 6 with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Scratched universe. In this universe, the pre-Scratch ectobiological parents/guardians are now the players and vice versa. The result is something like this trope. This appears to actually be a standard feature of Sburb</span>.
</li><li> Dad Egbert is romantically interested in Mom Lalonde while John has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Roxy Lalonde <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the post-scratch version of her.</span>
</li><li> The alternate versions of the ancestors introduced in Act 6 tend to be similar to their counterparts among the playable trolls... mainly because Andrew Hussie based most of them off fan stereotypes unless he had a better idea for what they should be like, so Cronus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderizes</a> Eridan's pathetic and sleazy traits, Meulin is Nepeta turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, Mituna is basically Sollux with literal brain damage, and Horuss has Equius's sweat, super-strength, and creepy horse fetish and not many other traits. Others are more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foils</a>; both Karkat and Kankri like the sound of their own voices but Karkat is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who constantly berates and insults the people he cares about to hide his true feelings, while Kankri is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">Hypocrite</a> who pretends to care about the plights of various oppressed groups by giving patronizing and condescending sermons that end up drowning out the voices of members of the groups in question.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KarinDou4koma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/KarinDou4koma">Karin-dou 4koma</a></em>: The Heavenly trio are looking for successors and find a trio of friends of exactly the right types and even similar backgrounds: Shigure —&gt; Ran (former vengeful ghosts), Rindou —&gt; Tamaryu (blue dragons), and Sachi —&gt; Shizuki (miko foxes).
</li><li> One of the running jokes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Precocious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Precocious">Precocious</a></em> is that Autumn Pingo is doomed to follow her parents down the road of library science; between this and the strong resemblance between all three family members, the rest of the cast likes to joke that the Pingos reproduce by cloning. Despite Autumn's protests that she won't fall into the trap, she certainly has the talent and inclination for her parents' field. Her mother Ivy also seems to share much of her mischievous and scheming nature.
</li><li> The entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sire">Sire</a></em>. The whole cast are Generation Xeroxes of classic literature characters, more or less. Whether or not they learn the "morales" of their sires and dams decides whether they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">get a "happy ending"</a> or suffer major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">Death by Irony</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em>:
<ul><li> Elan's entire family is susceptible to this. Elan, Nale, and their father Tarquin are drawn <em>exactly the same</em>, with the only differences between them, besides clothing, being Tarquin's gray hair and Nale's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil">goatee</a>. Furthermore, Elan and Tarquin both share their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">genre savviness</a> and love of drama, and Nale and his and Elan's mother (Tarquin's first wife) share a love of needlessly complex plans; however, each twin gets their outlook on life from the opposite parent (Elan and Elan's mother are Good, while Tarquin and Nale are Evil). <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0723.html">Lampshaded by V<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>V:</strong> Heredity is a cruel mistress.
</div></li><li> Subverted by Haley and her father, Ian Starshine. After the death of Haley's mother, Ian ingrained in her mind that family was the only people who could be trusted, and anyone else was out to get her — effectively making her a copy of him. While this is seemingly sound advice for a family of thieves, it leads to massive trust issues down the road for Haley. When she eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">calls him out on it</a>, he thinks that Elan has somehow brainwashed her and even refuses her rescue attempt, believing it to be a trap by Tarquin (somewhat justified, considering that Elan's father, Tarquin, is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadowDictator">Shadow Dictator</a> of the Empire of Blood and has been for a long while).
</li><li> Also subverted with Roy and Eugene Greenhilt. Despite Eugene's wishes (who wanted to Roy to be a Wizard like him), Roy grew up to be a Fighter like his grandfather. As it turns out, Eugene wanted him to be a Wizard because of his unresolved Blood Oath with Xykon, and he believed a Wizard to be better equipped to take on an Epic-level Sorcerer Lich than a Fighter (even after Roy defeats Xykon for the first time). This leads to a lot of unresolved conflict between them, and most of the beginning of <em>Don't Split the Party</em> is Roy and Eugene snarking at each other <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the Celestial Realm</span>, because, as Eugene (rightly) points out, being a Wizard would have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">prevented Roy's death</span> and maybe even turned the tide of the battle in the Order and Azure City's favor.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, Eugene *also* defied this trope with his own father, who was a Fighter just like Roy. In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">the one thing that Roy and Eugene have in common is that they don't have anything in common with their respective fathers</a>. Roy and his grandfather, on the other hand, play it pretty straight; it helps that Roy deliberately chose to embrace the legacy.

</li><li> British mountaineer Alison Hargreaves died climbing K2 in 1995. Her son, Tom Ballard, died in 2019 while climbing Nanga Parbat, also in the Himalayas.
</li><li> At the Battle of Sullivan's Island during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">American Revolutionary War</a>, Sir Peter Parker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KnightFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KnightFever">1st Baronet</a>, was shot in the thigh by American militiamen. Years later, at the Battle of Caulk's Field during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>, his grandson, Sir Peter Parker, 2nd Baronet, was also shot in the thigh by American militiamen. Unlike his grandfather, however, the wound proved fatal and he died from a severed femoral artery.
</li><li> Historically, it is easy enough to find examples of military personnel whose parents or kids were military personnel. This can sometimes lead to concerns regarding nepotism (it's easy enough to find examples of general officers whose parents or grandparents were also general officers).
<ul><li> Ever since the United States shifted to an all-volunteer force, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-05-02/a-photo-of-a-generals-family-highlights-civil-military-concerns">there have also been concerns about sociological trends regarding military service<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, namely that people are more likely to serve if they had family who served, and that the inverse is also true: Those who <em>don't</em> have family who served are less likely to serve. Over the course of several generations, you end up with something resembling a military caste, with limited interaction between military and civilians, resulting in what is referred to as the Civil-Military Divide.
