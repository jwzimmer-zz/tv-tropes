So, many speculative fiction writers use a shortcut: having everybody speak the same language, which can be through a single native tongue for everyone; or as it happens in our present day, a <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca">lingua franca<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> that many people learn as a second language.

Oftentimes, it is the human language, since humans are almost always the most widespread race, and other races will have their own "Common" language that all their members speak. All dwarves will speak Dwarven, all elves Elven (or Elvish) and so on.

</p><p>If you are not a native English speaker, you are currently experiencing this trope as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> by reading this page, as English is today's <em>de facto</em> global language throughout the entire world. It's so global that, despite being the 4th-most spoken native language in the world, it still has more second-language speakers than first-language ones.. On a more local level this happens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishLanguage">Spanish</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PortugueseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PortugueseLanguage">Portuguese</a> in Latin America; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage">German</a> in mainland Europe; English or French in different parts of Africa; Russian in Central Asia; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabicLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabicLanguage">Arabic</a> (and, to a lesser extent, Farsi) in the Middle East; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage">Mandarin Chinese</a> and Hindi in East Asia; and English in South/Southeast Asia and Oceania.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> when Armin notes that the language in Marley is an international one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">so they won't have any trouble communicating with the outside world at all</a>. So that's why the Marleyans can just show up on Eldian shores and talk to these people who have never talked to outsiders once for probably hundreds of years (except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInfiltration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInfiltration">spy kids those outsiders have sent in</a> who have also managed to blend in without a hitch). He does note that they'll have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentSlipUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentSlipUp">be careful with their accent</a>, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is typically justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> in that they're in Japanese-like regions (the first two sharing the names of their real-world inspirations) so everyone speaks Japanese except later the regions were expanded to be based off other countries, such as America (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em>'s Unova) and France (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">X and Y</a></em>'s Kalos). In <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> they explicitly speak French and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Looker</span> even has communication problems with a Kantonese women who speaks Japanese. In the anime no such language barriers exist. Ash can go from Sinnoh to Unova then to Kalos and speak perfectly with others. In the Japanese version of a Sinnoh episode, Jessie did mention she needed to learn English, yet she can visit Alola and Unova (both based off American states) and speak to the locals with ease. Everyone speaks the same language, however written language is not as simple. On top of the original Japanese, there is also the originally-4kids-exclusive writing that comes in several different forms. The protagonists, however, have no issue reading any variation of it.
</li><li> Similar to the anime, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> manga uses this trope. Characters from both the Japanese-based regions and non-Japanese ones can interact with no language barrier.
</li><li> Red from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PocketMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PocketMonsters">Pocket Monsters</a></em> is a kid from a Japanese-based region that never seems to have any issue speaking to people, no matter what region he is in.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> averts this; though most of the cast speak Midland's language, some characters speak Kushan, which none of the Midland cast understand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em> has a universal language to avoid any unnecessary language learning each time the hero travels to some new location somewhere in the world. Although there are several recently dead languages, or languages that people still use despite also knowing the universal language.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em> everyone speaks Japanese, no matter what country they come from. This is obviously mostly used in season 3 of the original series, as well as <em>Go: Galaxy</em>, when the Football Frontier International is held and everyone from every team from every country speaks Japanese, even when they're speaking among themselves. This also applies to the aliens in <em>Go: Galaxy</em> as well.
</li><li> The trope is evident in the "Monaco Cup Arc" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan">Yakitate!! Japan</a></em>, where the main characters are able to communicate with the foreign characters, who hails from all over the world (French, German, American, Monacoian, etc.) without any problems; even though Kuwabara explicitly mentions that he doesn't understand foreign language and it's highly unlikely that the non-Japanese characters (except perhaps Shachihoko) actually speak Japanese.
</li><li> Motohiro Kato's works <em>Manga/QED</em> and <em>Manga/CMB</em> often employ this trope by making every characters of all nationalities capable of speaking Japanese because the main characters travel overseas a lot. It's more evident for C.M.B. whose main character Shinra is highly regarded internationally as a wise person with vast knowledge.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em>The Basalt City Chronicles</em> averts this; in the Empire of Smilodons, it's said that there's a language for every island and a dialect for every village. Some cultures even have more than one language, for example the Deltharians (most of whom are deaf) have a spoken language used by the few who can hear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WarriorsOfTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WarriorsOfTheWorld">Warriors of the World</a></em> uses New Runic to unite the continent where the story takes place. There are other languages used (Morrocian, Umbalan and Payan within the Kingdom, Zwald within the Republic of Schwarzwald) but no one speaks any of the other languages unless they've confirmed the person they're speaking to can understand those languages as well.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EmpathTheLuckiestSmurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EmpathTheLuckiestSmurf">Empath: The Luckiest Smurf</a></em>, there's Smurf language, and there's human language which most beings (humans and non-humans alike) speak, including Psyches (though they call it Psychelian). There's also the "lost languages" of the Smurfs, which correspond to other human languages, such as Schtroumpf (French), Pitufo (Spanish), Schlumpf (German), Puffo (Italian), and Smurfentaal (Dutch). Painter Smurf occasionally speaks in Schtroumpf while Zipper tends to speak in Pitufo at times.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Fledglings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Fledglings">Fledglings</a></em> most Pokémon in the Cradle, on top of their individual languages, can understand a pidgin language that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">translated as English</a> storywise.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WarriorsRedux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WarriorsRedux">Warriors Redux</a></em>, predators have a common tongue known as "Fang".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CeladonsNewBlossom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CeladonsNewBlossom">Celadon's New Blossom</a></em>, it's explained that most people are bilingual. During school, they learn the native language of their home region as well as an international common tongue. This explains how people from different regions can communicate in the <em>Pokémon</em> anime.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RWBYScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RWBYScars">RWBY: Scars</a></em>, everyone speaks a language explicitly called "Common Tongue". This explains all the non-English names like Weiss Schnee and Xiao Long Yang. Most of the non-Common Tongue words come from "Old" languages that parallel Earth languages (such as Old Atlesian being German).
</li><li> The Common Tongue in the <em>RWBY</em> fic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LetUsBeYourPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LetUsBeYourPoison">Let Us Be Your Poison</a></em> is called "New Kingspeak" and is the official language of all four Kingdoms. It's practiced by all humans and is a modern version of Grand Kingspeak, a language that first originated in Mistral eight hundred years ago. There's a language barrier between humans and Faunus because many Faunus only speak their own tongue, Zhoviyak.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal">A.A. Pessimal</a> builds on the canonical Discworld, which has elements of the out-and-out fantastic fantasy world, but which as it evolved grew to be a rough one-for-one mapping of real Earth nations, ethnicities and languages overlaid on Pratchett's fantasy map. Pessimal acknowledges the canonical fact that Morporkian (English) is the pre-eminent dominant tongue and in many places is supplanting the native languages. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">Quirm</a> is so near Ankh-Morpork, for instance, with no separating body of water, that Quirmian is actually in danger of being supplanted by Morporkian as a spoken everyday language; on the other side, again with no intervening North Sea, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belgium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Belgium">Phlegmish</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">Kerrigian</a> are also being supplanted. The analogy is how Gaelic in Scotland and Ireland and Welsh in Wales were quite simply drowned out and swamped on the British Isles by English. however, Quirmian thrives in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">former colonies around the Disc</a> as a living language, as does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica">a Howondalandian language closely related to its parent tongue in the Sto Plains</a>. Indeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">Kerrigian</a> used to be spoken all the way from the Sto Plains to the port city of Chirm on the coast of the Circle Sea<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18mqu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18mqu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18mqu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The port of departure for emigrants to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica">Howondaland</a></span> - but has now retreated to its heartland, under the pressure of Morporkian.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is Basic, the language of the Galactic Republic. Nearly everyone understands it, even aliens that lack the ability to speak it. Likewise, most aliens have one language that they speak constantly. Interestingly, multilinguism is quite common — Han, for example, speaks Huttese, Wookiee (though he sounds really stupid when he tries), and Rodian.
</li><li> Huttese is a secondary example, as it is physically easier to speak for many non-human species than Basic.
</li><li> Looking to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a>, even if a character can <strong>understand</strong> another language, it may simply be impossible to <strong>speak</strong> it due to anatomy. The Ithorian language, for example, requires two mouths speaking in stereo. The Lorrdians, on the opposite side, have a language consisting entirely of body language, facial tics, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandSignals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandSignals">hand gestures</a>. There can also be other instances where other species are incapable of speaking <em>or</em> understanding an alien language, such as that of the symbiotic Paaerduags (introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em>) requiring not only two mouths to speak it like Ithorian, but also four ears to even hear it — hence, the smaller creature on the main one's back speaks Twi'leki for the convenience of any other species, the first one you meet claiming that the silent larger being does talk but says "nothing that you would understand".
</li><li> The Unknown Regions have a vast variety of local tongues and a bunch of trade languages to facilitate communication. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thrawn">Thrawn</a></em> introduces Sy Bisti as the trade language used in the region containing the Chiss homeworld.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium">Middle-earth</a>: While various "common tongues" existed for different times and places in this world, the most known is the "Common Tongue/Common Speech" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, which at that time is spoken by most people in western Middle-earth as either a mother tongue or a second language <em>lingua franca</em>, even among non-human races. That said, while Tolkien's work may be the trope namer, his handling of languages was much more subtle and realistic than later fantasy works:
<ul><li> The Common Tongue of <em>LOTR</em> is properly known as Westron, which evolved from Adûnaic, itself descended from the language of the House of Hador, one of the tribes of men in the First Age. Since the people of Hador were the most numerous of the tribes who settled on the island of Númenor, Adûnaic was established as the main language of what would become the major imperial power in Middle-Earth. When Númenor collapsed, Adûnaic was inherited by its successor kingdoms on the mainland, where it evolved into Westron under influence from Elvish languages. While most Mannish realms have their own languages, those geographically or culturally close to Gondor (the sole surviving Númenorean successor kingdom in the Third Age) speak Westron as a <em>lingua franca</em>, while for many of the non-Númenorean peoples living in what was once the successor kingdom of Arnor (like the Hobbits of the Shire and the Bree-landers), Westron had completely supplanted whatever languages they had spoken before. However, Mannish kingdoms farther away or antagonistic to Gondor, such as Harad or Rhûn, do not speak Westron.
</li><li> Orcs speak a bastardized Westron out of necessity, as the countless tribes each have their own mutually unintelligible dialects that can't be used whenever they amass together. Their dark master Sauron eventually creates the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech">Black Speech</a> as an intended common tongue for all his minions, but it only really catches on among his highest-ranking servants and the garrison at his chief fortress of Barad-dûr, though the orcs do adopt a lot of its vocabulary.
</li><li> The Elves have <em>two</em> common languages: Quenya and Sindarin. Quenya was spoken by those Elves that journeyed to Valinor, while Sindarin eventually became the main language of those who remained in Middle Earth. When the Elves who journeyed to Valinor returned, they kept Quenya among themselves but also learned Sindarin, making it the chief lingua franca among the Elves. Both Quenya and Sindarin have their own dialects as well, however.
</li><li> The only race that has only one native language are the Dwarves, who speak Khuzdul, and they generally refuse to use it in the presence of non-Dwarves outside of a few words and phrases (the reader only hears it in Gimli's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCry">battle cries</a> and a few proper names). The rest of the time they use the languages of their Mannish neighbors (this state of affairs is reminiscent of the Jews, on whom Tolkien based the Dwarves). Despite the great distances between the various Dwarven communities, Khuzdul has remained unified and unchanged over the years, mainly because even the Dwarves themselves treat it as more "a tongue of lore rather than a cradle-speech" and deliberately try to keep it static. Unlike the manish and elven languages which developed organically it was a direct gift from their creator.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClanOfTheCaveBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ClanOfTheCaveBear">Clan of the Cave Bear</a></em>: The various individual camps of Clan people have their own languages but there is a formal Clan language that everyone can "speak" (it's non-verbal); when Ayla meets Jondalar she wants to learn the human Universal language and can't understand for a while that there isn't one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> has Galach, derived from English mixed with some Slavic languages and a smattering of other Old Earth tongues. But there are many other languages such as the Chakobsa hunting speech of which a dialect is spoken by the Fremen, and the Atreides battle language that is <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SignedLanguages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SignedLanguages">signed</a> (so enemies can't overhear) instead of spoken.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em> universe, there is a common language based on English called Stark, short for Starways Common. At the same time, many cultures, who have spread out among the stars, have retained their own languages, even though they still use Stark when working with computers or sending messages. When traveling to Lusitania, settled by descendants of Brazilians, Ender tries to learn Portuguese, and the book is peppered with Portuguese words and phrases. Several Swedish words are also used constantly, specifically those dealing with the so-called "Hierarchy of Foreigness" (which Valentine Wiggin developed after choosing to settle on a Swedish-speaking planet).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4akak');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4akak" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4akak');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OrsonScottCard">Orson Scott Card</a> learned Portuguese while serving a Mormon missionary in Brazil.</span>

The Yeerks designed it to be spoken by all kinds of different host bodies with unusual vocal chords.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LiadenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LiadenUniverse">Liaden Universe</a>, the common language is called Trade, and that's what it's mostly used for.
</li><li> Andarra and Desriel share a language in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLicaniusTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLicaniusTrilogy">The Licanius Trilogy</a></em>, with a few unique words here and there. The latter is actually an offshoot of the former, so it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hellspark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hellspark">Hellspark</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JanetKagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JanetKagan">Janet Kagan</a>, the common language is called GalLing' (presumably from "galactic lingua franca"); it's an artificially-constructed language, and one of its design features is that it only uses phonemes common to all human languages, so that anybody can speak it without difficulty.
</li><li> A language called "Tongue" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HouseOfSuns">House of Suns</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlastairReynolds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlastairReynolds">Alastair Reynolds</a> is described as the closest possible equivalent to a universal galactic language, and even then a lot of civilisations don't understand it.
</li><li> This is a puzzling matter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> series, and one of the greatest flaws in what is otherwise a masterwork of worldbuilding. Everyone in the entire world speaks the same language, with minor dialectical variations, including people who have been completely isolated for <em>a thousand years</em>. No explanation for this is ever given in the text, though according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the availability of printed text has cut down on linguistic drift. However, this still doesn't explain a lack of regional dialects, especially with the largely illiterate common people, or the Seanchan still being understandable by the rest after millennia of isolation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> slightly subverts the trope by revealing that "the common tongue" that humans speak is actually the dwarven language.

Because a unified language doesn't do away with either accents or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageDrift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageDrift">Language Drift</a>, communication issues occasionally arise (the protagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoundationAndEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoundationAndEarth">Foundation and Earth</a></em> encounter problems because Solaria's version of Galactic is twenty millennia out of date). Especially notable is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> transition of Trantor to Hame (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">based on</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople">Istanbul (Not Constantinople)</a>).

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a> universe, characters in different countries speak different languages, but everyone also seems to know how to speak Imperial.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> Expanded Universe, it's revealed that though there are many languages still spoken amongst the Sentinal's races, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Zentraedi</a> has become a sort of common tongue that everyone can understand. This is justified because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Robotech</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Masters</a> used the Zentraedi as soldiers to create their empire, and thus the language was spread.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Humanx Commonwealth</a></em> universe has "symbospeech", an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">Conlang</a> that became a common tongue through serendipity. Shortly after humans and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">thranx</a> met one another, they spent some time working out a language that was easily pronounceable by both species, as they had wildly different vocal apparatus, and the thranx language incorporated significant body language aspects in addition to vocalizations. When additional species were encountered, symbospeech was found to be functionally pronounceable by them, too, and thus became the <em>de facto</em> galactic language.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMason">Anne Mason</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KiraWarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KiraWarden">Kira Warden</a></em> novels have "the interplanetary language". Theoretically, most people know how to speak it; in practice, a lot of them are pretty bad at it, and it's not very good at nuance, providing lots of work for interpreters like the protagonist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OracleOfTao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OracleOfTao">Oracle of Tao</a></em>: While elves know Elvish, and there are some languages from the original Earth (the only ones that survived also had an alphabet attached), there is Common. There's also confusingly, English, which Common is based on. But Common has different grammatical rules such as being able to start sentences with but and ignore some punctuation like commas, except when used to break a sentence up arbitrarily. Obviously, the author is writing in Common, not English, for convenience.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>. The "Common Tongue of Westeros" is only universal in the continent of Westeros itself, where most of the action takes place. It is a major world language, and most merchants in major ports from Essos to the Summer Isles will probably be at least familiar with it - but more isolated groups like the Dothraki mounted hordes in central Essos do not know it. Specifically, the "Common Tongue" is actually the language of the Andals, who migrated to Westeros thousands of years ago, displacing the earlier "Old Tongue" of the First Men. The conceit of the story is that Westeros is a fantasy version of the British Isles, but as a continent the size of South America. The Andals are thus the analogue of the Anglo-Saxons, and the First Men the analogue of the Celts. Meanwhile, in Essos, the Valyrian empire once ruled half the known world, and was basically Fantasy Rome (with dragons) - but their empire collapsed 400 years ago after a volcanic eruption in their capital, and their provinces fragmented. Since this collapse, the languages spoken by all their different colonies in the Free Cities and elsewhere drifted into different "Low Valyrian" languages. Their original language, "High Valyrian", is still used by scholars and educated social elites, and is thus their fantasy analogue of Latin. The different Low Valyrian languages are like how French and Italian diverged from each other. Well-educated aristocrats from Oldtown to Meereen can speak High Valyrian, but in terms of languages used by the man on the street, it's a bit of a tossup. Sailors are even described as using a pidgin "Trade talk" to communicate in ports, mirroring real life use.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uplift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uplift">Uplift</a></em> series the ridiculously organized and stagnant culture of galactic civilization has resulted in at least twelve different Galactic languages (numbered 1-12) designed to accommodate the wide variety in vocal structures; humans seem to have the easiest time with Gal 7. One of the assorted ways that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Earthclan</a> is different from the other oxy-breathing races is that they have languages other than Galactic, mostly Anglic and Trinary, a poetic language designed for dolphins.
<ul><li> Gal One is a binary language like Morse code, mostly used to program computers.
</li><li> Gal Two is basic, logical, unambiguous... and boring.
</li><li> Gal Three, Four, and Ten are hard for humans to speak but neo-dolphins have little difficulty.
</li><li> Gal Five and Nine are completely unpronounceable to Earthlings.
</li><li> Gal Six, Eight, Eleven, and Twelve are difficult for Earthlings but possible.
</li><li> Gal Eleven is intended to be used to bridge the gap between different orders of life (oxygen, hydrogen, machine ...), it's only partially successful and intended to be transmitted by radio or psi.
</li><li> On Jijo in the second trilogy, colonized by six species living a low-tech lifestyle, most people speak Gal Two, Gal Seven, and Anglic interchangeably (though Urs speak Anglic with a lisp). The latter is because the humans were the only species to know a means of recording information without electronics (books), so nearly every written word on Jijo is in Anglic.
</li></ul></li><li> Generally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison">Harry Harrison</a>'s novels set in the future will have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage">Esperanto</a> (a failed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> attempt at making one language out of many) as the language of the old Empire and as lingua franca of all worlds. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deathworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deathworld">Deathworld</a></em> novel <em>The Ethical Engineer</em>, Jason finds himself on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">Lost Colony</a> and tries to converse with the locals.

</li><li> As it happens, most of the aliens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">speak English anyway</a>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">because most of the aliens we see are diplomats and interstellar merchants, and Earth is the new dominant power in both of these areas</a> (the Minbari being semi-isolationist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Space Elves</a>).

</li><li> And played for a plot point in one episode. A Minbari ship, meeting an alien race for the first time, communicates to them in Interlac ... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">and gets a reply in Minbari</a>.

<ul><li> Of course, the way they chose to represent the elements (as orbiting spheres) doesn't sound like something various alien races would come up with on their own. Especially since the Asgard claim that they can't think primitively.
<ul><li> Given the language itself is thousands if not millions of years old, it was most likely a time when the Asgard could "think primitively."

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a>,</em> this trope is subverted — the TARDIS is translating for both the Doctor and his companions.

<div class="indent"><strong>Ninth Doctor:</strong> Lots of planets have a north!
</div></li><li> If you attempt to speak a native's language to them on purpose while being translated, it will sound like a foreign language they know of, but can't speak themselves.
</li><li> Translation also fails if the language lacks the concept for the word you are using, E.G in <em>Fire of Pompeii</em> when a companion tries to warn the citizens about a volcano they didn't understand as Latin didn't have a word for it during that time period — until Mt. Vesuvius erupted. This justifies the Doctor's technobabble as both things untranslated (nonsense words), and him having to work around this limitation by explaining things out or use metaphors. A good example of this in real life is "layman's terms", wherein somebody is trying to explain specialized knowledge to somebody who doesn't know specialized vocabulary or key concepts.

But tries to not give in <em>completely</em> as it has language-related magic. Specific settings are likely to have a "Lingua Franca" and a handful of specific languages.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> subverts this by having several "trade languages" even on Faerûn. Usually people can talk to each other, but on the larger scale there are Common "common" (Heartlands' dialect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planecommon</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KaraTur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KaraTur">Kara Tur</a> "common", Undercommon (mix of Dwarven, Gnomish, Low Drow, Upper Common, etc.), Auld Wyrmish ("common" across dragon subspecies). Other continents may have their own "common" languages, like Midani of Zakhara. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">many specific cultures</a> retain their own tongues still, though some reduced to dialects of "common". So learning all half a hundred or so present tongues (like Wemic or Gnomish speech) is unnecessary, but doesn't that <em>comprehend languages</em> spell seem worth learning now? (If you want to talk back, you might need the <em>tongues</em> spell too.)
</li><li> Some other D&amp;D settings have a named language (usually human) that serves the in-game function of a Common tongue, such as Thyatian in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a> (the language of the Known World region's dominant empire) or Balok in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a> (the language of its oldest domain, favored by merchants).
</li><li> Simplified in 4th edition (no surprise there); for the most part there are only ten languages, with Common being the trade language. There are however 7 other languages for different regions.
<ul><li> Of particular note is the Supernal language, the language of the Gods, the very first language. When the speaker speaks in Supernal, everyone would understand what the speaker says as if in their own native tongue. In fact, all other languages are variants of the Supernal, in how the various races perceived the Supernal language. While you can learn the Supernal language, ultimately subverted because mortals lack the necessary power to fully speak in Supernal, thus losing its capability as universal language.
</li></ul></li><li> One old 1E article on AD&amp;D languages proposed that Orcish, Goblin, Kobold, Gnoll and similar tongues weren't separate racial languages, but dialects of a <em>monsters</em>' version of this trope. This would explain why such races, never renowned as intellectuals, automatically knew each others' languages in the 1E era.

</li><li> <em>Shadow World</em> setting supplement <em>Star Crown Empire and the Sea of Fates</em>. Across the Central Basin the most commonly spoken language is Trade Common, AKA Imperial Common. It is even spoken outside the Star Crown Empire.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a> tends to lean on Reikspiel, the language of the Empire, in this capacity. It isn't a universal world language by any means, but the Empire is easily the biggest and most prominent of the human realms, and hence its language has a certain reach and importance as a Lingua Franca. Most elves, dwarfs and others who deal with humans tend to learn Reikspiel for communication (the elder races finding it childishly easy, but crude and ugly on the tongue), and even brutish races like Orcs and Beastmen tend to learn a few choice boasts and insults to torment human victims with. In the RPG, set largely in the Empire, all characters are presumed to know Reikspiel, but non-Imperial characters also get their own native language for free. In the first edition, however, Reikspiel was just a dialect of a true common tongue called Old Worlder (which had its own Greek-and-Latin equivalent in Classical Old Worlder).
</li><li> The "Gothic" language in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a> serves this purpose for the Imperium, acting as a way for cultures from different worlds to communicate. There is also High Gothic, which is used for official purposes and has a role similar to Latin in medieval Europe in that no-one actually uses it as a first language but scholars and those of high rank are expected to know it.

It is simply a language humans use (with countless local and national variations) and not even all of them - people from Skellige use their own dialect, while Nilfgaardians and Zerrikanians use different variants of Elder Speech, language of the elves. Elder Speech itself is used in a few different forms that have as much relation to each other as Romance languages have with Latin.
</li><li> <em>Dark Dungeon</em> RPG, supplement <em>Samaris, Island of Adventure</em>. In the world of Yaddrin, the Common Tongue is spoken by most merchants and travelers.

<ul><li> In the Tian Xia/Dragon Empires subsetting (the farthest, although not most obscure and isolated, continent from the Inner Sea) the Tien language is so common that in that part of the world it is often referred to Common (Taldane is still spoken by some groups, but the same is true for Tien in the Inner Sea).

It's the main language for humans, though there are others (Orlesian, for example). The elves have a language of their own, but is has been mostly lost as a result of centuries of slavery and the like.

<ul><li> The alternative name for common language is <em>lingua franca</em>, which translates literally into "Frankish language". The original <em>lingua franca</em> was a pidgin language based on Medieval northern Italian dialects, but also containing elements of Medieval Latin, Medieval French, Medieval Ibero-Romance languages (e.g. Old Spanish) and Arabic. It was used as a trade language all around the Mediterranean during the Middle Ages. Since all Romance languages stem from Latin (even today they are mutually intelligible to some extent, and in the Middle Ages they resembled each other much more closely than today), it was easily understood everywhere.
</li><li> Creole languages have their origins in this trope. All creole languages are descended from pidgins, which are the methods of communication used by people who speak different languages. Because they cannot communicate purely in their languages, they have to use other methods, possibly by creating new lexicons or repurposing others. The pidgins can then expand their use as common tongues by continuing to evolve and being learned by the children of their speakers, until eventually everyone uses the pidgins both at home and in public. By this time, these "pidgins" are no longer known as pidgins, but creoles, and have every right to be seen as real languages.
</li><li> English is the most universal example of this trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, due mostly to the very expansive English-speaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishEmpire">British Empire</a> and later the global dominance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheUnitedStates">The United States</a> in the latter half of the 20th century. Although it is not the most natively-spoken language, it is the most often taught as a second language, and thus the most widely spoken. This is confirmed by international treaty, which stipulates English as the official language of aerial and maritime communications, and is considered a working requirement for various scientific fields. They don't call it "the world language" for nothing.
<ul><li> Previously, French held a similar position due to its widespread use among the aristocracy of Europe. Today, French is still extremely common as a second language.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage">German</a> is still a rather universal language in mainland Europe, it is mostly useful when talking to older people who never learned English in school but learned German for historical reasons (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>). Many younger people can still speak some German, but as a second language English has gotten <em>much</em> more popular (few young Europeans without German as their native language speak it fluently, while many young Europeans without English as their native language do speak it fluently). So when the older, German-proficient generation has died out, it seems that English will be even more universal and German will not be that useful anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishLanguage">Spanish</a> was once this for much of Europe and the Americas due to the vast Spanish Empire of the 16th century and its great amount of mutual intelligibility with southern and central Italian dialects (fairly important given the trade importance of the Mediterranean). It has since yielded its ground to other languages, but to this day it's still the thirdmost widely-spoken language in the world only after English and Mandarin. It's also the fourth language by number of countries where it's spoken and second by number of native speakers, with native speakers located in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Spain">Spain</a> (other languages like Basque, Catalan and Asturian are spoken as native tongues, but "Castilian"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5py0c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5py0c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5py0c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">its official name in Spain</span> is the common language for the entire country), most of Latin America, parts of the United States,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note68ic6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note68ic6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note68ic6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most of the Southwest is <em>de facto</em> bilingual, although states range in their attitudes towards this from merry accommodation (California's official policy is to provide services in Spanish, and New Mexico is almost but not quite officially bilingual) to acceptant indifference (Texas has few official policies about bilingualism, but Spanish is widely understood and government services are readily available in Spanish), to rejection (Arizona was one of the first states to declare English its sole official language, and services are only available in Spanish for fear of lawsuits). Spanish is also widely spoken in Greater Miami (thanks to all the Cubans and other Caribbean Spanish speakers) and in certain major urban areas on the East Coast (New York City having the highest concentration, with both Philadelphia and Baltimore-Washington having respectable numbers, and the primary urban centers of New Jersey—Newark-Elizabeth, Jersey City-Union City, Camden, and Trenton—also have high concentrations of Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, and Cubans).</span> a couple of African countries, and a minority of people in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines">Philippines</a>. Since the Spanish language is supervised by the institution known as the "Real Academia de la Lengua Española" or R.A.E.,, grammar rules are 99% the same in all of them. However, vocabulary and idioms vary a lot from country to country, and even from region to region. There are around 9 different accents in Spain alone. Nevertheless, when something needs to be written or translated for all Spanish speaking countries equally, there is a convention known as "Neutral Spanish", which consists in using the most plain, common words in the language and a pronounciation and intonation that can be best described as "accent-less Mexican", so anyone can understand it without major confusions. Not a perfect solution, though, since there are always words or sentences that sound a little bit unnatural to people from one country or another, not to mention that it limits the quality of the writing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage">Esperanto, the Universal Language</a> was an attempt at this. Its creator's goal was to create a language that was easy to learn and easy to speak, no matter what one's native language was, a "universal second language". While it did manage to gain a small but fierce group of followers that to this day still maintains publications, websites and books written in Esperanto, the language has by and large failed to catch on (obviously, otherwise we'd probably be speaking it now). Critics of the lingual construction noted that it is based almost exclusively on European languages, with no thought given to other language groups. Its defenders, meanwhile, claim that it would be nearly impossible to create a universal language that also accounted for non-European languages like Arabic, Hindi or Mandarin Chinese.

</li><li> Further constructed languages attempting this: Interlingua and Ido.
</li><li> Also Loglan and its offshoot Lojban (short for "logical language" in English and Lojban respectively). The former of which was mentioned in a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s novels for use with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a>.
</li><li> As part of the legacy of the conquests of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>, Greek used to be pervasive in the Middle East, to the point where even the Tanakh (AKA the Hebrew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Bible</a>) was translated into it so that it could be understood by Hellenized Jews. Hellenistic Greek is actually the Trope Co-Namer, as its most basic and used variety was known as <em>Koine Dialektos</em> (literally, the Common Tongue). Koine Greek is also the original language used to write the New Testament; the idea was to capture as much audience as possible in the Eastern Mediterranean.
</li><li> Before Greek, Aramaic was the Common Tongue of the ancient Middle East. Originally used by a bunch of trading city states around Damascus, it was co-opted as the lingua franca by the Assyrian Empire when it conquered Syria in the early 1st millennium BC. Afterward, it spread quickly, penetrating all parts of the empire, including Babylon, Elam, Egypt, and Canaan. However, it was not until the Achaemenids came around in the 6th century BC and expanded the policy that it was firmly planted in the population. The Macedonian invasion led to its decline in Egypt and Northwest Syria, but the language continued to flourish everywhere else. In some places, it was promoted from being a unifier to an outright vernacular. By Roman times, it was the first language of basically everyone in Palestine. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> has been theorized to speak Aramaic, not because it was the lingua franca (Greek served that purpose), but because he was raised speaking it (Hebrew had long been relegated to religious purposes).
</li><li> Russian, enjoyed this status in the Communist bloc. Learning Russian there was like learning English in Europe. It still works that way in the countries of the former Soviet Union.
<ul><li> In newer generations, not so much anymore.
</li><li> Russian, with English, also functions as a common tongue language in outer space.
</li></ul></li><li> There have been attempts to "reconstruct" the original Sioux language, before the splitting into five dialects. This results in things like a sound not unlike the Japanese R instead of the /l/, /d/, and /n/ that are so famous, though no r-like sound exists in modern-day Sioux languages.
</li><li> In past centuries, French was the language of choice for international communication. Many French are still bitter about it being supplanted by English. French still enjoys official status as the language of diplomacy and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a>. All public addresses at the Olympics are translated into English, French, and the language of the host country.
</li><li> A rather surreal example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Madagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. It is an island about thrice the size of New England. There are a lot of natural barriers (mountains, jungles, etc.) there. The people currently living there trace their ancestors no later than the 3th century AD. Yet, there is precisely one native mother language, and that is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.omniglot.com/writing/malagasy.htm">Malagasy,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> spoken by the entirety of the island's 24 million-plus souls. And what is more, it did not come from the African mainland (285 miles away), but from Borneo (more than 4,000 miles away, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">as the crow flies</a>). Either the Borneans really were the first people to colonize the island, or the Africans already living there (assuming they did live there) adopted the newcomers' language as soon as possible, or...
</li><li> The language people know as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage">Chinese</a>" is actually only Mandarin, which is spoken largely everywhere due to it being taught as part of the official curriculum. Otherwise, people in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a> speak a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseDialectsAndAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseDialectsAndAccents">large family of languages</a> sufficiently dissimilar that knowing one doesn't help in understanding another — from Germanic and Romance languages written in the Latin alphabet (Portuguese in Macau and English in Hong Kong), to Turkish languages written in Arabic alphabet (Uyghur in Xinjiang), to Mongolian written in either Russian or classical Mongolian script (in Inner Mongolia).
<ul><li> However, their common descent (from the Old Chinese language spoken up to about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">Warring States Period</a>) means that <em>learning</em> them is easier once you know one of them. Ask a native English speaker who has taken French and then Spanish (or any other combination of Romance languages) how much easier the second language was than the first for a comparable phenomenon<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note732zv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note732zv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note732zv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Conveniently, the split has further analogues: the Min languages split off before the other ones (Min evolved directly from Old Chinese, possibly starting to diverge as early as the Han Dynasty, while the other varieties evolved from Middle Chinese, and began to seriously split from each other no earlier than the Tang), much in the way that the Balkan dialects of Vulgar Latin that became Romanian and its close relatives were more separated from the Italian and Western dialects than they were separated from each other</span>.
</li><li> Chinese linguistic unity is further increased by its logographic (each symbol represents a word) system of writing. The same glyph is pronounced differently in each language, but the meaning usually remains the same. Therefore, a written language independent of speech, known as Classical Chinese, developed, serving as a Common Tongue (or Common Pen?) for the educated not only in China, but also countries under Chinese influence (Japan, Korea, and Vietnam). However, Classical Chinese was based on Late Old Chinese and thus did not reflect several features of more modern Chinese languages, including pronunciation<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note81xxp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note81xxp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note81xxp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Contrary to popular belief, most Chinese characters <em>do</em> reflect pronunciation[[note]]However, Japanese does not have this, as they borrowed and re-borrowed the same glyph for multiple entirely separate words</span>. They are usually composed of two parts, one giving the sound of the syllable it represents, and the other indicating the meaning)[[/note]] and grammar. Classical Chinese fell out of use shortly after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">Xinhai Revolution</a> of 1911, but the Republic of China (Taiwan) used it well into the 1970s for certain government documents.
<ul><li> That said, the bit about each character having the same meaning in different languages only bears true for single-character words. Various languages and dialects in Chinese will use different character groupings to describe the same thing, particularly for things that did not exist until recently. This is what was lost with the end of Classical Chinese: it was exclusively a written language which carried the same meanings across dialects but which would be pronounced differently based on who was reading it. When that was abolished, the ability to communicate in writing across linguistic boundaries in a "neutral" manner also disappeared.
</li></ul></li><li> As a bonus, the official name of the Mandarin Chinese language in China is <em>Putonghua</em>, which literally means "common speech".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a> is in the same boat as China: there are <em>thousands</em> of languages, but almost everybody there speaks Hindi or English. After India became independent, there was a movement to purge British influences, including English. The return to traditional languages failed because it was far too useful to have a single standard language that most educated people already knew. Moreover, English persisted because attempts to make Hindi the universal standard met stiff resistance from (among others) the Dravidian-speaking states of South India, who view attempts to promote Hindi (an Indo-Aryan language) as an imposition of a specifically North Indian identity over the South rather than developing an All-India culture. English, being competely foreign to India, is neutral and therefore preferable to Southerners, and they pushed hard (and still do) to keep English in place. Economic reforms in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, which opened India to the wider world economy in which English is a huge advantage, put the final kibosh on any attempts to remove English from the country (and gave rise to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperatorFromIndia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OperatorFromIndia">Operator from India</a> trope).
</li><li> In even earlier centuries, Latin was the preferred language for scholarly discourse. Latin is <em>still</em> in use by the Roman Catholic Church as its preferred language for edicts and internal documents.
<ul><li> A working knowledge of Latin was still vitally important for students of zoology, biology and medicine until well into the second half of the 20th century, and has occasionally been used as a <em>lingua franca</em> when scientists from many different cultures lack another common language.
</li></ul></li><li> The Malay language serves as one for the Malay archipelago, thanks to its long-standing use as a trade language since the 7th century Srivijayan Empire made it the <em>lingua franca</em> of the western part of the archipelago. When that empire fell, the language already took hold in various coastal ports of the eastern part due to the Malays' seafaring tradition and became firmly established by the time the Europeans, especially the Dutch, came over and realized what a wonderful coincidence of a language already existing to unify their humongous and culturally diverse colonies. It continues to be a unifying language to the present day. While it's true that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Brunei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Brunei">Brunei</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia">Malaysia</a> are not completely homogeneous ethnically and linguistically, Indonesian (a modern register of Malay) is basically one of the few things that enables the over 300 ethnic groups with their <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Indonesia">over 700<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (!) languages in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia">Indonesia</a> to associate with each other. Without it, forget about inter-island communication. People living on different corners of the same island wouldn't be able to form intelligible conversations.
</li><li> A similar situation exists in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines">Philippines</a>, where Filipino, a standard register of Tagalog, is used to unify the country's roughly 175 ethnic groups and languages. Modern era has slowly replaced (or rather, assimilated) it with English, but it won't disappear anytime soon.
</li><li> Hebrew served as a <em>lingua franca</em> for Jewish traders throughout Europe and the Middle East for centuries.
</li><li> Due to its rather tumultuous history, Italy had more than a few, depending on which of the local states was preminent at a certain time and in a certain area.
<ul><li> By the time of the Renaissance, things had stabilized...with <em>three</em>, depending on what one was doing: Florentine (a dialect of Toscano standardized and made acceptable as a literary language by Dante Alighieri through his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em>) was the language of literature and arts, Venetian was the language of trade, and Ligurian (or Genoese) had supplanted the <em>lingua franca</em> as the language of <em>international</em> trade.
</li><li> By the 17th century a "purer" variant of <em>Standard</em> Florentine (as in, the version codified by Dante, as opposed to <em>spoken</em> Florentine that had slowly evolved) was adopted as standard Italian and became the <em>lingua franca</em> against the opposition of proponents of spoken Florentine (mostly Florentine themselves), courtiers that proposed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">Conlang</a> derived from all local dialects, and the official version of Romanesco (a fusion of Rome's defunct language and Toscano spoken in the Papal Court and, at the time, inside the walls of Rome, without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">the immense amount of vulgarities that to this day are the signature of the people's Romanesco</a>), opposition won once and for all in the 19th century due the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBetrothed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBetrothed">The Betrothed</a></em> (originally written in his native Milanese by Alessandro Manzoni but later rewritten in Italian), before eventually spreading to the people. Standard Italian would remain a common tongue, as opposed to the day language, until radio broadcasts started spreading it.
</li></ul></li><li> In general, when a large empire spreads its language around and then dies (either by being conquered or by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe">splitting up into squabbling fiefdoms</a>...or as often happens, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">both</a>), the language usually starts to diverge into dialects, which eventually become mutually unintelligible. However, that language may persist as a Common Tongue for the educated.
<ul><li> One of the weirdest cases of this has to be the situation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabicLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabicLanguage">Arabic</a>. Nationalism and the printing press — factors that tend to stabilize languages — arrived at a time when the dialects of Arabic formed a continuum<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note99trw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note99trw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note99trw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">e.g. an Egyptian speaking entirely in dialect can relatively easily understand a Palestinian doing the same, and a Palestinian a Syrian, and a Syrian an Iraqi, and an Iraqi a Kuwaiti, and a Kuwaiti a Bahraini, but the Egyptian and Bahraini can barely understand each other, if at all</span> with only one significant break (between Western "Maghribi" and Eastern "Mashriqi" dialects,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10lua0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10lua0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10lua0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or alternately between <em>Darija</em> and <em>`Ammiyya</em>, after the native word for the colloquial speech: <em>Darija</em> ("low, base") is used in Western, <em>`Ammiyya</em> ("popular, common") in Eastern</span> right about where the border between Egypt and Libya is today), and even that wasn't a complete one. Additionally, everyone in the region used various forms of Classical Arabic (the language of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a>) for educated writing. As a result, Arab scholars developed Modern Standard Arabic, a streamlined form of Classical Arabic that also tends to get flavored with the dialect of the user<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1145mr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1145mr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1145mr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, Egyptians will pronounce as a hard "g" what everyone else pronounces as a soft one, a Tunisian and a Syrian will call months by different names, and <em>everybody</em> prefers to use subject-verb-object sentences ("Sam eats oranges") rather than the verb-subject object ("Eats Sam oranges") preferred by Classical Arabic, to say nothing of how lists are now almost universally "X, Y, and Z" rather than "X and Y and Z")</span>, but which is universally understood by anyone who has been to school in an Arab country. However, people still speak their native dialects in all but the most formal circumstances. Even in semi-formal situations, people will speak in their native dialect but use a lot of Modern Standard vocabulary. This last bit is the cause of a major fight among the Arab literati — many feel that this "educated colloquial" should form the basis of a new standard, abandoning the Classical entirely. Those who accept this view themselves bicker about whether one "educated colloquial" should be adopted as a single standard for all Arab countries (creating a new Common Tongue) or whether each country or group of countries should adopt their own standards (abandoning the idea of a single Arabic language altogether). Those who agree that there should be a single new standard are wont to bicker over whether it should be based on one dialect of the "educated colloquial" (usually Egyptian, because everyone knows it anyway<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12ew4a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12ew4a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12ew4a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">from watching altogether too many Egyptian movies and altogether too much Egyptian TV</span>) or some kind of amalgamation (in which case, how would you do that, etc., etc., etc...).
<ul><li> Arabic itself could count as a common tongue, since it is widely used in Muslim countries for studying the Qur'an, though only a fifth of all Muslims use it as everyday speech.
</li><li> To complicate things even more, Algeria and Morocco don't even use Arabic in educated or formal speech — they just use French, and most Moroccan universities list a French certification as an admission requirement.
</li><li> As a side note, until the early 19th century you heard more Arabic than Latin in medical schools in Europe, the reason being that most actually useful medical texts were written in either Greek or Arabic, and it was considered imperative for a doctor to be able to read Avicenna in the original language.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Japanese dialects aren't so different that people would have too much trouble communicating with each other (aside from a few cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage">Separated by a Common Language</a> and when Okinawan gets involved), but they still have <em>hyojungo</em>, or "standard language", that is roughly based on the Kantō dialect.
</li><li> American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SignedLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SignedLanguage">Sign Language</a> is this for the deaf world, mainly because for the longest time, the United States was the only country with colleges for the deaf, and even today, it remains the only country with the <em>only</em> university for the deaf (Gallaudet University). Many American deaf students would grow up, and go to establish schools for the deaf in other countries. Therefore, many of the countries' own sign languages are either derived from or affected by American Sign Language — or they simply use American Sign Language. (Fun fact: American Sign Language originally derived from French Sign Language, with strong influence from the old sign language of Martha's Vineyard. British Sign Language is totally different.)
<ul><li> Part of this lies in the difficulty of translating sign languages into spoken languages or into other sign languages. Grammar, syntax, and morphology are also different in every language and are difficult to grasp well through sign language because word order is often highly dependent on context.
</li></ul></li><li> Software often can be described into a common tongue, mostly by using pseudo-code. This breaks it down a routine into commonly used keywords that can be "translated" into other languages easily. Another method is describing it with diagrams and models, for which the Universal Modelling Language (UML) was designed to do.
<ul><li> In a more literal sense of this trope, almost all programming languages are in English.
</li></ul></li><li> While it's impossible to know the true extent of it due to European observers being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">biased</a> and the language itself being suppressed in colonization, Plains Sign Talk is a signing language that was used by at least 37 tribes in North America as a trading language, as well as for the deaf and for certain social functions.
</li><li> Swahili is one of the most widely spoken languages in East Africa, with official status in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Rwanda, as well as being the only native African language to be official in the African Union. It's the main language of business, education, and urban life in East Africa. However, it exists practically <em>only</em> as a common tongue, as it has a mere 2 million native speakers against more than <em>100</em> million nonnatives; it's spoken natively only in a small area of Tanzania called the Swahili coast, but the people living there became the main intermediaries between native Africans and Arab merchants, which led to Swahili becoming the main trade language of the area. This balance is shifting, though, as many urban East Africans are now being raised with Swahili as their primary language.
</li><li> Sango, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CentralAfricanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CentralAfricanRepublic">Central African Republic</a>, only has a few hundred thousand native speakers, but it is the main language used in the country for business, local government, and urban centers. The Sango tribe lives along the Ubangi River and they were mostly a trading/merchant people, leading to their language becoming the main trade language of the area.
