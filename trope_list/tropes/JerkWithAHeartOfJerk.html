Apparently, difficult as it may be to imagine, he may not be that bad a guy. Somewhere, buried deep inside, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment that shows he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>.

<ul><li> Griffith, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">bastard</a> than a quasi-sympathetic jerkass, but every once in a while he releases the jerkass within. One moment happens when he rescues Princess Charlotte from the clutches of the Emperor Ganishka in a very romantic and fairytale-ish way. Unfortunately for her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Charlotte has been crazy in love with Griffith ever since she first lay eyes on him</a>, and Griffith <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveEveryGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveEveryGirl">has been using her feelings for him</a> ever since in order to get closer to the Midland throne.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Mayuri has no hidden heart of gold because everything he does is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>. When Szayelaporro resurrects himself by draining Mayuri's daughter and lieutenant's life-force, Mayuri initially seems shocked and dismayed as he crouches over her withered body. A moment later, instead of showing remorse or swearing revenge, he grins broadly and compliments Szayelaporro on possessing such a fascinating technique.
</li><li> Light Yagami in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>. Truly no redeeming qualities to his evil, as even his "good" acts are just means for his selfish purposes or murder plots. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He even goes so far as to think to himself he's willing to kill his sister or father if it will assist him in becoming the new God. While his father <em>is</em> killed, he's not the one who did it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakIllOfTheDead">but he does ultimately insult his memory near the end by remarking how his idealist nature made him a fool in such a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">and ends up pissing off Matsuda for his trouble</a>.</span>
</li><li> Vegeta was very much like this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> after going into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> situation with the heroes but before undergoing a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, several times surprisingly helping the heroes but only doing so for his gain. The most notable case is when he saves Gohan and Krillin from being killed by Guldo and Gohan thanks him— Vegeta specifies he wasn't saving them, but rather using the fact that Guldo's guard was down to eliminate one of the opposition.
<ul><li> Freeza, however, plays it straight. Even when forced to help Goku and the others in the Tournament of Power (to the point of even contributing energy for Goku's Genki Dama, and delivering the final blow against Jiren <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">right alongside him</a>), he's immediately back to his old tricks, conquering planets, trying to steal the Dragonballs, and recruiting Broly to try to kill Goku and Vegeta.
</li></ul></li><li> Decors Weissmel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheFiveStarStories">The Five Star Stories</a></em> is a complete dick, who just <em>sometimes</em> gives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> vibes. But in the end, this is just because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>, and has the principles that he tends to adhere to — not just some hidden nobleness of his thoroughly evil heart.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Mustang finds out King Bradley is a homunculus, he calls Bradley on a seeming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment earlier in which Bradley was trembling at Hughes' funeral. Bradley reveals that rather than being sad, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchSentiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchSentiment">he was shaking with rage because Hughes' daughter was making such a scene</a></span>. Ouch.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a>, the Elric Brothers discover Psiren the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief">Phantom Thief</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> to be a nurse. The brothers decide to let her go when she tells them she just steals to keep the hospital from closing down. Sometime later the hospital is torn down anyway and Psiren is now a nun claiming to steal to save a church from closing down. After <em>that</em> is demolished she's claiming the same thing as a teacher at a school, after which even Al won't deny that she's just stealing for herself. It's ultimately subverted in the end, though, as she is acting as a thief for a good cause, just not the one she initially claimed to be fighting for: the town she operates in is one with an incredibly poor economy, and her acts are such a spectacle that they've been drawing tourists in just to see her in action, which in turn helps keep the place afloat.
</li></ul></li><li> Toward the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed">Ginga Densetsu Weed</a></em> anime, Jerome sees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Hougen</a> dragging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Reika</a> back to land when they're caught in a raging river. It looks like Hougen may have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment...but then he uses Reika as a stepping object to get himself back onto land, leaving her to be swept away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeIsMyMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeIsMyMaster">He Is My Master</a></em>: While there are a few instances that might border on true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> status in the anime (definitely not the manga), Yoshitaka pulls these moments all the time.
</li><li> Ryoki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HotGimmick">Hot Gimmick</a></em> was already established as a Jerkass due to the cruel and abusive way he treats his girlfriend/slave Hatsumi. It seems like he's not so bad when he saves Hatsumi from being raped but his qualifying status is reinforced when he immediately forces a kiss on her afterward and habitually sexually assaults her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>: Kyouya Hibari. Half carrying Gokudera to find Tsuna in Kokuyo Land, how nice of him. Not. He throws Gokudera aside afterward, and it turns out he only helped the latter so they could be "even". Don't even get started on the countless times he turned up to kick enemy butt and then says 'They were crowding'.

Of course, he had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">pretty awful home life</a>, which causes Carmen to fall for him, thinking there is some good underneath him.

Some people (in story and out) believed that his crankiness is because of his leg problem — and then it's shown that he was a jerk even before that. He has later gone through therapy, gotten clean, and has become slightly but consistently less of a jerk who even starts subconsciously manipulating others to their benefit, rather than his own.
</li><li> Happens to Barney often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, and usually it's Lily who temporarily thinks he's done something caring. For example, the time he's detailing all the subtle signs that indicate that a nearby girl at the bar has been recently crying, and he seems sympathetic at first, but it turns out he's just analyzing her vulnerability to being manipulated into sex.
<ul><li> There's a particularly good example in one Thanksgiving episode. Ted and Robin decide to help out at a homeless shelter on the holiday, where they find that Barney is the model volunteer there in his spare time. They spend the entire episode completely dumbfounded by the fact that he is capable of good deeds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until they discover that he's there as part of court-mandated community service for drunkenly urinating on a church.</span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Ted:</strong> You <em>are</em> evil! <br/><strong>Robin:</strong> All is right with the world!
</div></li><li> Also, in one episode he tells his friends how he went to see the woman who broke his heart years ago and quite wistfully talks about how she's a mother now, how she was sorry for what she did to him, and how all he has is a closet full of suits and a string of one-night stands. When his friends show sympathy towards him, he laughs and says that what he meant was that she had become incredibly lame and he is still awesome, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">reveals that he had sex with her afterward and secretly recorded the tryst, and then forces his disgusted friends to listen to her moans and screams.</a>

In one of the most magnificent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> plots Barney's ever conceived, he tells Lily in advance about a play he's going to run, which she uses by getting a friend to pretend to fall for it to steal the Playbook. Then he announces that he's going to run a play called "The Scuba Diver," which Marshall notes isn't anywhere in the book, piquing their curiosity. They run down to the bar to inquire about it, and he only points out his target, who Lily decides to warn off. But after the rest of the gang relates the story to the girl, they still want to know what the play is, so they approach Barney, who starts in on some spiel, stops, and says some stuff about how the plays were just a way to get his mind off his breakup with Robin. Then Lily talks Barney up, saying he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>, and he leaves with the girl, then texts the gang telling them to look under the table, where the play is taped to the underside, describing all of this. All that just to invoke this trope.

The formula is usually like this: Will thinks Jay has finally done something just slightly thoughtful or said something non-stupid, and Jay proves him wrong or follows the thoughtful action up with something that is assholish. However, it is largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, so Jay is in general more sympathetic than many examples of this trope.

</li><li> But the biggest example of this trope by far, which is seriously saying something, is none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Lucifer</a> himself, probably to no one's surprise considering he's the friggin Devil himself. Every time he seems to show a humanizing or sympathetic quality he subverts by doing something utterly heinous. For example, in season 5, he says that he genuinely cares for Sam and wants him to be happy, but it's revealed in season 11 that he never really liked him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Near the end of the same season, he seemingly reconciles with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> and makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> but then when God leaves earth with his sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiGod">The Darkness</a>, what does he do?

But by far the biggest instance of this trope happens in season 13 when he fathers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim">Nephilim</a> son named Jack, which once again brings up the possibility that he has some humanity in him, and is even willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">join forces with the heroes once more</a>, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">he can bond with him</a>.

How does Lucifer react when his son rightfully calls him out?

Once in awhile, she'll show her soft side; such as genuinely loving Tommy and attended his funeral and consoled his brother Sam. But Maxine is a very cruel racist person who would rather kill a non-human (vampire, shifter, etc.) with a big smile on her face when given a chance, regardless of who they are. Such as Sam whom she sold out and attempted to murder with the rioting townsfolk in Season 7; despite telling him that he is part of the family a few seasons ago.

Then Day 5 comes in and gives us Miles, who is brought in from Homeland Security to take over CTU after it gets hit by a terrorist attack.

But his Homeland partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Karen Hayes</a> insists that when the chips are down he is someone who can be counted on, and when it comes down to it brings him into the loop so he can help expose <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> President Logan</span> as the true mastermind of Day 5, and it looks like he's going to mellow out. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Instead, he almost immediately switches sides and destroys the evidence that could expose Logan all so he can get a promotion.</span>

As an example, in "Light Spinner", she seems to be reaching out to Catra, telling her former ward that she was only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">so hard on her</a> because they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> and she wanted Catra to be strong; this is shown, within minutes, to be a complete copper-bottomed lie, told to trick Catra into bringing Shadow Weaver a key tool for her escape. It's also shown in the same episode that her long-past mentorship of Micah was at least in part an attempt to use his vast magical talent in service to her hunger for power.
</li><li> Catra seems to fall into this as well. In "No Princess Left Behind", she gives the sword back to Adora and lets her escape with Glimmer, but then in "Promise" tells her it wasn't to be nice to Adora but because she didn't want to see her again and was doing better in the Horde without her. In the second season, she starts to show signs of appreciating Scorpia's affections and devotion to her, only to threaten her near the end of the third season when she disagrees with Catra's actions caused by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>. Catra also initially treats Entrapta with kindness (though even then she was being manipulative), but grows increasingly jealous of her bond with Hordak, ending with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Catra exiling Entrapta to Beast Island as a result of the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> mentioned above, and lying to Hordak about his friend's absence, telling him that Entrapta betrayed him</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, whenever Mr. Burns shows any sign of a softer side, he almost always ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">reverting to form by the end of the episode</a>. Homer notes, "I guess some people never change. Or they quickly change and then quickly change back." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, ultimately subverted when he reforms for real - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">or at least for a longer period than usual</a> - after the death of his old girlfriend just as they are about to get back together, she had left him years ago when he told her he'd never give up being selfish for anyone, even her.</span>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">Cartman</a> seems to always have an ulterior motive for any good actions, despite what he has led the audience or other characters to believe. In "Major Boobage" when he wants to save the town's cats from being taken away, it's so bizarrely and honestly charitable that it felt like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaTwist">Meta Twist</a>. Of course, Cartman does manage to rack up some jerk points when Kyle insinuates that Cartman is a hypocrite for wanting to keep cats hidden in his attic and yet sympathizing with the Nazis while they hunted down European Jews similarly hiding in attics — and Cartman, who <em>knows full well</em> what Kyle means, gives a completely disingenuous response.

</li><li> Stephen and Linda Stotch have both treated Butters pretty shoddily. Then you see times when they love Butters. Unfortunately, these displays of affection never last, as Stephen's authoritarian nature tends to bounce back before the episode even ends.

Gibbs points out the time Palmer purposely stranded Gibbs in space because Palmer was trying to get to a date. Gibbs says that it took him two months to get home. He arrived on his birthday, which Palmer completely forgot. All Palmer says is "Wow, I said we were buddies, I never said we were married".
</li><li> At his friend Spud's funeral, he at first talks about how Spud was a great wingman, but then brags about his sexual conquests, to the shock and disgust of Gibbs and Jodi. When Gibbs gives his eulogy, Palmer interrupts Gibbs to generally brag about how cool he is.

What's more, she gave Gwen the cold shoulder for stealing Duncan from her when Gwen attempts to apologize. After making amends, the two promise to go to the finale together but Courtney reveals that she is going to eliminate Gwen to bring Scott with her so he can give her an easy win. Worst, she thinks that Gwen will acknowledge her actions. After Gwen discovered this, when given a chance for redemption (i.e. vote for herself), she is reluctant to do so.
