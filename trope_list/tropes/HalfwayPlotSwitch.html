<ul><li> One 1995 story had Jason entering a chess contest with Roger and wins $50, thus turning the story into Jason using the money to taunt his siblings. Then, the plot shifts to Jason spending all his money on 5,000 gumballs, which he eats all in one weekend. THEN, the plot shifts to Jason getting his first cavity as a result of eating all the gumballs, before finally leading up to Jason's first dentist visit.
<ul><li> Probably a bigger one occurred in 1999, with a big story of Roger going on a business trip out of state, then returning home to find Jason in stitches following a Hot Wheels accident. After two days focusing on Jason and his stitches, the plot switches to Roger quitting work to spend more time with his family. He then gets scammed out of $199.99 in an infomercial. He then tries trading stocks on the Internet and winds up losing $11,000 in the second hour (after earning $3,000 in the first hour). After everyone at Roger's work goes crazy without Roger there to mess things up, he gets his job back. However, Roger sold the family computer after losing the money in the stocks, so the plot finally goes to Andy buying the iFruit.

<ul><li> In another arc, Calvin is trying to do his homework when gravity reverses, causing him to get stuck on the ceiling. Just after everything reverts to normal, he starts to grow bigger and bigger until he falls off the Milky Way Galaxy. As he puts it, "this has been a very peculiar afternoon." The 10th anniversary special has Watterson admitting that the story was "weird for weirdness' sake".
</li><li> Another story arc had a variation of this; Calvin and his parents go to a wedding for presumably a friend of the mother, but Calvin accidentally leaves Hobbes behind and gripes about it throughout. But when they return home, the family is horrified to learn their house had been broken into and robbed. The parents are visibly shaken by the robbery, while Calvin gets scared that Hobbes may have been stolen, but after he's found under Calvin's bed covers, Calvin quickly goes back to normal, but the plot now focuses on the parents dealing with the robbery. And then it ends with Calvin complaining about the TV having been stolen.

One Wacky Adventure lasted from August 2001 all the way to March 2005 just because the cartoonist kept changing the plot (though each story does flow into another relatively well).
</li><li> A 1976 storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicstrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicstrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> had Snoopy determined to play tennis at Wimbledon, which he believes is near Kansas City.

Lampshaded when he laments "And now I can't even remember why I'm wearing this stupid tennis visor!"

The narrator goes on to say that Frederick lived life among other frogs...and then used his powers to travel through time to the United Kingdom and become a secret agent. The rest of the plot focuses on Freddy trying to solve a mystery with his human team Scotty, and Deffers. The only cohesion comes from the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Freddy's aunt is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> having apparently gotten bored of ruling the kingdom for which she killed Freddy's family in the first place and teamed up with an overweight evil man to steal monuments instead.</span>

Just as that mystery is solved and the plot comes to a climax, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed that we've been watching a movie-within-a-movie.

By the end, it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the haunting of the film set actually has nothing at all to do with the story of the movie-within-a-movie after all</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FunnyPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FunnyPeople">Funny People</a></em> was advertised as a funny yet touching story of a famous comedian coming to terms with the value of his own life when he's diagnosed with a deadly disease. About halfway through the film, however, he's cured, and he spends the rest of the film getting entangled in a romance with his married ex-girlfriend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromDuskTillDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromDuskTillDawn">From Dusk Till Dawn</a></em> starts off as a crime-thriller about a pair of brothers on the lam who kidnap a family. Halfway through, they stumble into a slapstick-gore film with vampires. The second sequel rehashing the plot switch structure with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">western</a> with a post carriage theft plot preceding the horror.

The film changes to a horror story about forty minutes in when she's murdered out of the blue by a psychotic motel manager, and the rest of the film follows him.

</li><li> The classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds">The Birds</a></em> starts out as a romance and then shifts gears about half way through the movie, turning into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">horror movie</a> about the titular animals.
</li><li> The driving plot thread of the first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Vertigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Vertigo">Vertigo</a></em> is the mystery behind Carlotta Valdes and whether or not Madeline is possessed by her. The second half of the film (after Madeline's death) is centered around Scottie's obsession with Madeline and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerReplacementLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerReplacementLoveInterest">the lengths he'll go to</a> in order to be with her again.

And look, at the two hour mark they marry in a show-stopping number. Cue end-credits any time n— oh wait no, that's right: Nazis. Cue 45 minutes of defiance, heartache, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">quislings</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkReprise">dark reprises</a>.
</li><li> <em>The Cottage</em>, a British movie, begins as a black comedy about a bungled kidnapping before turning into a dark horror comedy about a Leatherface-type slasher killer half way through. Presumably it was inspired by <em>From Dusk Til Dawn</em>.

Neither of these plot points make much of a difference in the end because right after Bond escapes, the real plan to destroy Silicon Valley is introduced and a relatively minor clue (a check made out to a woman from San Francisco) brings Bond to California.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em> starts as a surveillance mission to determine if the titular character is smuggling gold in and out of England to get the best price. Smuggling is forgotten quickly with the phrase "Operation: Grand Slam" which turns out to be a plot to nuke the gold at Fort Knox.

Then the forest catches fire, the second half of the movie is a desperate struggle to survive and escape the burning hell, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> part is completely forgotten. (Even before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty">Dwindling Party</a> kicks in.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> did this a lot with his later films. It's actually a trademark of his that his films were split into two distinct halves, and it got to the point where he'd even explicitly label them.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> does this not once, not twice, but <em>four</em> times. The first plot focuses on the evolution of man, and then we switch to a plot centered on Dr. Floyd participating in a top-secret mission to the Moon which turns out to be because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they had found the first conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life</span>. Then much of the rest of the film is switched over towards showing the lifestyles of the two conscious astronauts aboard a long-distance flight when some strange things happen, before taking a dark turn where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hal kills everyone except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoleSurvivor">David Bowman</a></span> at which point it becomes an incredibly surreal series of occurrences that lead to the next stage of human evolution.
</li><li> Like the book it was based on, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em> was specifically divided into three parts. The first introduces Alex and shows us the dystopian world in which he lives as we see him and his droogs go out and do all kinds of nasty things. Then we get to the second plot centered around the experimental rehabilitation technique, and finally the third story where Alex must deal with the effects of the technique.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FullMetalJacket">Full Metal Jacket</a></em> starts off with Joker in boot camp, focusing on the decaying mental state of Private Pyle and his interactions with Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. After Pyle's murder-suicide, the film follows Joker to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">war</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stripes">Stripes</a></em> deals with the irreverent recruits just barely pulling it together to pass boot camp. The rest is about their first mission as they're sent to Italy to recover a militarized RV.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDescent">The Descent</a></em> is somewhere between this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopingDoomedCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopingDoomedCharacters">Developing Doomed Characters</a>, as the film spends a while dealing with the personal interactions and physical hardships of a group of female spelunkers, then adds subterranean cannibals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock">Hancock</a></em>, rather infamously. It starts as a comedy about a superhero who really sucks at his job. Then halfway through, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it turns into a dramatic action movie when his PR person's wife turns out to be another superhero who was Hancock's former wife and they're both immortal</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeIsBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LifeIsBeautiful">Life Is Beautiful</a></em>: Starts off as a romantic comedy, where Guido <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Orefice</a> eventually wins the affection of Dora and they have a son named Joshua. Switch time — Let's send them all to a concentration camp! Guido tries to make the best of the situation for Joshua by telling him that if he doesn't complain/cry and hides from the guards he would gain "points". 1000 would win a tank. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Just before the camp is liberated by the Americans, Guido gets caught by a guard and unceremoniously shot.

</li><li> <em>Rat Pfink A Boo Boo</em>. The plot was altered during filming to accommodate anything and everything that passed through the director's hands. Most notably, when a gorilla suit became available, they wrote a gorilla into the movie. It suddenly shifts from being a gritty crime drama to a superhero spoof.
</li><li> The first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Parasite2019">Parasite 2019</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> about the poor Kim family conning their way into cushy jobs working for the rich Park family. At the halfway point, the Parks go out of town for a night. This allows for the former housekeeper (whom they'd gotten fired by making it seem like she had TB) to get back to the house. This is when the Kims find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's been hiding her husband in the secret basement for four years</span> and at that point it becomes a thriller.
</li><li> <em>Mortal Thoughts</em> starts off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a>, then morphs into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalThriller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychologicalThriller">Psychological Thriller</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathProof" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathProof">Death Proof</a></em> is about a group of attractive girls hanging out at a bar who meet a mysterious older named Stuntman Mike. And then... he kills them all, and we move onto a different group of girls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frequency">Frequency</a></em> goes from a dramatic story about a son reconnecting with his dead father into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> thriller.
</li><li> Baz Luhrmann's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Australia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Australia">Australia</a></em> hits this midway through the film. Once Lady Ashley and the Drover deliver the cows to the dock, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, and it's suddenly revealed that the main villain has been fed to crocodiles by his second-in-command, the narrative has jumped forward several years, and Australia is suddenly in the midst of World War II. During all this, the plot changes from "deliver the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>" to "rescue the child protagonist and save the Aboriginal children in the midst of Japanese bombing runs".
</li><li> This shows up in a <em>science documentary</em>, of all things. Called <em>The Dark Secret of Hendrik Schon</em>, it's about the titular scientist, a titan in the field of theoretical physics. The first two-thirds of the program are about his early career and work in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">nanotechnology</a>. It builds up some drama around the unnerving applications — a weapon of assassination, an engineered biowarfare agent, the feared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">Grey Goo</a> scenario, and so forth. Then around the forty-minute mark, a student reading one of Schon's papers picks up a clue that leads to his real "dark secret": <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He was a fraud. His papers were lies built upon fake experiments he never conducted and "evidence" he made up out of whole cloth.</span> Whether this is a masterful subversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">Science Is Bad</a> hysteria, a piss-take on the idea that the scientific community knows everything, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthParody">Stealth Parody</a> of sensational documentaries, or just a flaw in one such documentary is up to the viewer.
</li><li> In <em>Icarus (2017)</em>, the documentary starts out with Bryan Fogel (the director) trying to win an amateur cycling race through doping and getting past testing as an experiment. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The person he uses to help him with this, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, was (at the time) the director of Russia's national anti-doping laboratory. As they become buddies, it's revealed that there is a Russian state-sponsored doping program Grigory runs. As news of this program comes out in the media, Fogel flies Dr. Grigory to the States to testify about it while keeping him safe. The documentary is all about Grigory and the doping program from this point on.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Imposter (2012)</em>, French career conman Frédéric Pierre Bourdin impersonates a missing boy - Nicolas Barclay - in order to get to the United States. Throughout the movie, he details all the crazy things he did to trick the family. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He was eventually found out by several authorities (an FBI agent and a private investigator). Then the focus shifts to the family and how they were so inviting of a man who was obviously not Nicolas. The conclusion drawn by several people is that someone in the family killed Nicolas and everyone covered it up. The documentary ends on an uncertain note, though several family members plead to the camera that this is not the case and that Frédéric is a liar. </span>
</li><li> ''The Queen of Versailles" starts as sort of a puff piece on Time-Share magnate David Siegel and his wife Jackie, as they construct the Versailles House (which would be one of the largest, most expensive homes EVER). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then the Great Recession of 2008 hits and we see their family struggle to adjust as David's company takes some huge hits.</span>
</li><li> The <em>30 for 30: Fantastic Lies</em> film adopts this trope for the infamous Duke Lacross Rape case. It first paints the picture of life and culture at Duke up to the accusation, switching to the accusation as one would expect when it comes up. Then, when its revealed the accusation is false, there's a notable shift to the victim, Nifong, and just how things got this far when there was evidence from the very start that would have cleared the accused.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DearZachary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DearZachary">Dear Zachary</a></em> already starts off sad, detailing how Andrew Bagby was loved by friends but killed by his mentally-unstable girlfriend Shirley Turner. While she's about to go to trial for Andrew's murder, Turner reveals she's pregnant, and Andrew's parents attempted to battle to get custody of the baby. The film was meant to be a compilation of people talking about Andrew so that his son, the titular Zachary, would know him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But then, in a horrendously cruel twist of fate, Turner kills herself and Zachary. The rest of the film is about Andrew Bagby's parents getting justice for their grandchild through new laws that would keep people in Turner's situation (about to be on trial for murder) in prison before trial.</span>
</li><li> The little known 1988 film <em>Permanent Record</em> spends about twenty minutes convincing you it's just throw away teen angst when the kid we thought was the protagonist <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leaps off a cliff to his death</span> between jump cuts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrailOfThePinkPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrailOfThePinkPanther">Trail of the Pink Panther</a></em>'s (1982) first half has Inspector Clouseau investigating the latest theft of the Pink Panther diamond. Then he goes missing, and the film switches to the adventures of a TV reporter investigating this via interviewing his friends, foes, and family. Why? Clouseau's actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers">Peter Sellers</a> died in 1980, before this film was <em>written</em>, and his scenes in the first half are mostly-deleted scenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePinkPantherStrikesAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePinkPantherStrikesAgain">The Pink Panther Strikes Again</a></em> put into a new context. The second half boils down to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> of the previous films. All of this sets up the <em>next</em> film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CurseOfThePinkPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CurseOfThePinkPanther">Curse of the Pink Panther</a></em> (1983), which introduces a new protagonist and leads up to the revelations of what happened to the diamond and Clouseau.

Out of nowhere, Bill Pullman simply turns into Balthazar Getty and a completely different story unfolds...but not really.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TokyoZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TokyoZombie">Tokyo Zombie</a></em>: The first half of the movie centers on the main characters trying to escape the zombies on the streets of Tokyo. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Five years later</a>, and it's set in a bizarre society controlled by the rich, and Fujio is now a professional 'zombie-wrestler'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrivateBenjamin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrivateBenjamin">Private Benjamin</a></em> starts out as a story about a woman making it through basic training, but mid-way through the movie, she's not even in the Army anymore and the conflict revolves around her and her lover.
</li><li> The "Oedipus Wrecks" segment of <em>New York Stories</em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a> character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">Beloved Smother</a> vanishing during a disappearing act of a magic show.

</li><li> To the extent that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NapoleonDynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a></em> has a plot, it pulls one of these. There's little plot to be seen in the first half, but once Pedro decides to run for school office, most all focus goes to his campaign.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInventionOfLying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInventionOfLying">The Invention of Lying</a></em> has this. The first half of the movie is about a man in a world where everyone tells the truth discovering he can say falsehoods and people believe him, and the second half <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> turns into a commentary on love and religion</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfFlyingDaggers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfFlyingDaggers">House of Flying Daggers</a></em> starts out as a story about a soldier trying to infiltrate a rebel organization, with the implication that he's going to end up falling in love with the blind girl who is his only lead and have to choose between love and duty.

Then they go on a boat trip with his wayward brother who is suddenly attacked and murdered by drug dealers the brother owes money to. The three characters are then forced to seek shelter and fight to survive on a nearby uncharted, uninhabited island.

Soon, even she begins to doubt her own sanity, especially when the captain proposes that her daughter died along with her husband, and that she's in deep denial over this. After discovering that it's all a plot to blackmail the airline for a lot of money and frame her for it, the movie promptly turns from a psychological thriller into an action flick, where she tries to find her daughter, while trapped on a plane with a killer and his accomplice.

</li><li> The Australian film <em>Japanese Story</em> is billed as a romantic drama involving an Australian scientist (played by Toni Colette) who ends up having an affair with a married Japanese businessman. About 2/3 of the way into the film, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the businessman dies in a freak accident while swimming, and the rest of the film is spent on Colette's character dealing with the corpse and the aftermath of this man's death</span>.

</li><li> The movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightClaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NightClaws">Night Claws</a></em> was pretty much <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RebBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RebBrown">Reb Brown</a>, Bigfoot, and a horror-flavored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">Cliché Storm</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldsEnd">The World's End</a></em> starts off as a rather bittersweet comedy about a forty-year old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> screw-up getting his high school gang back-together to try and complete an incredibly difficult pub crawl. Then, about half-way in, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they discover their old town has been replaced by alien replicants, and it turns into a sci-fi action flick</span>.
</li><li> The classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Predator">Predator</a></em> starts with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> trying with his fellow soldiers to save a US politician from a band of South American terrorists.

Unlike some other examples, this wasn't a surprise to original audiences, and the film begins with something falling to Earth from space and the team encounters the remains of the alien's previous victims early in the film, albeit first under the impression it was the terrorists who did it.

But halfway through the movie, Starkiller Base, the First Order's new Death Star-style superweapon, is introduced to provide an ersatz Death Star for the finale.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillerMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillerMountain">Killer Mountain</a></em> starts off as a fairly standard mountain climbing drama/thriller, but then the remaining protagonists discover Shangri-La, an immortality serum, and monsters that are implied to have been left behind by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a>.
</li><li> <em>High Lane</em>, another mountaineering film, turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie">Slasher Movie</a> for its second half when its protagonists suddenly find themselves being hunted by a feral, cannibalistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MountainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MountainMan">Mountain Man</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> begins as a story about a small town police chief trying to convince the mayor that there's a shark and having to deal with the island being more concerned with the economic impact than lives. The second half is a three man buddy movie as the chief goes on a shark hunt with a grizzled old fisherman and a rich young scientist. We never see anyone from the town again until the sequel.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LakeBodom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LakeBodom">Lake Bodom</a></em> starts as an archetypal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie">Slasher Movie</a> (group of teenage friends go camping in the woods where unsolved murders occurred years ago, sexual tension and partying happen, people start dying) until the reveal that half of the group has been plotting to murder the others. The film then follows their effort to dispose of the bodies while extensive flashbacks explain their motives, until a second twist reveals that they are actually being stalked by a crazy murderer, and the film goes back to the slasher genre.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BetterWatchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BetterWatchOut">Better Watch Out</a></em> starts out as a seemingly run-of-the-mill home invasion horror movie, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter">babysitter</a> and the adolescent boy she's watching over are stalked by an armed intruder. Thirty minutes in, we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire thing was set up by the kid and his friend, so that he could impress her by stopping the intruder and "saving the day".

</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heckler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heckler">Heckler</a></em> starts out as Jamie Kennedy's examination of hecklers, in which he interviews comedians about their thoughts on heckling and confronts actual hecklers who interrupt his stand-up comedy shows. About halfway through, the film twists and starts going after movie critics in the same fashion, with the surprise thesis that critics are really just hecklers.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BAPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BAPS">BAPS</a></em> begins as a screwball comedy about two girls from the ghetto who are hired to scam a dying millionaire into thinking one of them is the granddaughter of his first love. Halfway through the movie, their conscience gets the better of them and the movie takes a sharp turn for the dramatic as they get him to have fun in his last days while re-evaluating their own lives and relationships.
</li><li> The first half-hour of <em>Assault on Death Mountain</em> (the sequel to <em>Assault on Devil's Island</em>) involves the main heroes trying to rescue a little girl from her evil millionaire father, and the final hour of the movie is about the heroes trying to stop an evil Syrian weapons dealer from unleashing killer gas on America.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Submarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Submarine">Submarine</a></em>: The first half is about the development of Oliver's romance with Jordana, which then shifts abruptly to Oliver investigating his mother's infidelity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>: The movie starts with the surviving heroes from the last film planning to find Thanos, take the Infinity Stones back and use them to bring back everyone who died. They find him in the first 10 minutes, where it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thanos anticipated this and <em>destroyed</em> the Stones, and is now essentially a heavily injured retired man who poses no threat.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood">Ed Wood</a>-penned <em>The Bride and the Beast</em> initially starts off as the story about a newlywed who realizes that she is the reincarnation of a gorilla, which is the reason why male gorillas are aroused by her. Then halfway in, she and her new husband, a big game hunter, go on an African honeymoon and the film then turns into a story about the husband going after some escaped Bengal tigers attacking people on his campground. Meanwhile, the titular bride is shoved into the background, and no gorillas are seen until the last 10 minutes when the original plot finally resumes.
</li><li> <em>An American Terror</em> starts out looking like it will be an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elephant">Elephant</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroDay">Zero Day</a></em>-esque drama that follows a trio of social outcasts as they prepare to commit a school shooting, but then it turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlasherMovie">Slasher Movie</a> when the man who two of the would-be school shooters try to steal guns from is revealed to be a homicidal maniac complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureCellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureCellar">Torture Cellar</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hugo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hugo">Hugo</a></em> spends a good chunk of its runtime detailing the life of the titual street urchin living in a train station, trying to figure out a way to fix an automaton found by his late father, but once he finds out that Papa Georges is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgesMelies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgesMelies">Georges Méliès</a>, most of the rest of the film focuses on his various real life exploits of working on silent films instead.

</li><li> <em>Double Image</em> by David Morrell: A photographer takes pics of something in Bosnia that really pisses off a bad guy. As soon as that plotline is resolved, said photographer becomes obsessed over a mysterious woman in some pictures he finds.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon">Sidney Sheldon</a>'s <em>If Tomorrow Comes</em> is divided into three "books". Books One and Two, which take up a little over a third of the novel, tell the tale of Tracy Whitney's horrifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> experience when she's framed by the Mafia for a robbery and wounding, and how she gets her revenge on the guilty parties. In Book Three, her struggle to make an honest living while paroled from prison leads to her becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassyCatBurglar">Classy Cat-Burglar</a> who finds herself matching wits not only with European authorities but a fellow con artist. The main nemesis is an insurance investigator who briefly met up with her in Book One as part of his investigation of the false crimes; he becomes obsessed with tracking her down when his employer is besieged with claims for things she's stolen.
</li><li> The children's book <em>Mandie and the Secret Tunnel</em> starts out as a drama that turns into a mystery/treasure hunt midway through the story.
</li><li> Arguably used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissSmillasFeelingForSnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissSmillasFeelingForSnow">Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow</a></em> where a routine murder mystery trope dives off the deep-end into X-Files-esque killer bug from space about halfway through the novel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RealmOfTheElderlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RealmOfTheElderlings">The Tawny Man trilogy</a></em> starts out with a book about prince Dutiful's abduction by the Piebalds, with his upcoming betrothal to an Outislander princess a background detail. The Outislands plotline becomes more prominent in the second book and completely makes up the third book, while the Piebald storyline becomes less prominent and is ultimately resolved off-page in the third book.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StrangerInAStrangeLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StrangerInAStrangeLand">Stranger in a Strange Land</a></em> starts out mainly with a plot about Valentine Michael Smith's (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MosesInTheBulrushes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MosesInTheBulrushes">human raised as a Martian</a>) land rights to Mars, but then this issue is resolved with surprising ease, and the plot transitions to be primarily about Smith creating a religion and becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Messianic Archetype</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>. Though, this is more of a 3/4 way plot switch, which is how long it seems to take the author before she suddenly remembers she was planning on writing a vampire novel, as well as an angsty May-December romance. The same things happen in the other books. In <em>New Moon</em>, most of the book is devoted to Bella recovering from Edward leaving her, finding out about the werewolves, and the werewolves hunting for Victoria. Suddenly, the climax of the novel goes to being about Edward planning to commit suicide via the Volturi, and Bella and Alice having to save him. In <em>Eclipse</em>, most of the story is devoted to the Bella/Edward/Jacob love triangle, and only gives focus on the matter of the vampire army and Victoria near the end of the book. In <em>Breaking Dawn</em>, the first two sections of the book (as well as a bit of the start of the third) are focused on Bella and Edward marrying and her having and raising her half-human daughter. Most of the third section is about the Volturi arriving to use Renesmee as an excuse to kill the Cullens, with flavors of a vampire conspiracy and the set up for an epic battle <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that never happens.</span>
</li><li> This actually happens <em>twice</em> in Smeyer's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHost">The Host</a></em>: It starts out being about an alien adjusting to life as a bodysnatcher, then devotes the entire second act, and much of the third, to developing platonic and romantic relationships with the rebels, before focusing on saving the humans near the end. Really, this is practically Smeyer's signature style.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKneeboneBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKneeboneBoy">The Kneebone Boy</a></em> starts with three kids dropped off at their aunt's house while their single-father goes out of town on business. Upon finding out their aunt is away on vacation, they go to a small town with a castle, where they find out about the legend of the Kneebone Boy, which says that the first-born child of the family who owned the castle would always be born as a deformed monster. The middle of the book sets up several intriguing plot threads which leave the reader guessing...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> then drops them all in the last few chapters without resolution to reveal that the castle is now a mental institution where the children's mom is.</span>
</li><li> The first chunk of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTwits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTwits">The Twits</a></em> is vignettes about how horrible the twits are. The second chunk is about the family of monkeys trying to escape.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheGreatGlassElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheGreatGlassElevator">Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator</a></em>. The first half has the elevator and its occupants accidentally ending up in orbit and ultimately rescuing most of the crew of a space hotel from carnivorous aliens. Once the elevator returns to the chocolate factory, the second half has the three still-bedridden Bucket grandparents overdosing on reverse-aging pills that Willy Wonka invented, necessitating a journey far beneath the factory to rescue one of them. The events of the first half aren't brought up again until the last chapter.
</li><li> The first chunk of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleStar">Little Star</a></em> is effectively about Lennart and Leila raising Theres <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before she kills them</span>. Then there's a significant chunk about Theres growing up, followed by a section on Theresa's life before the two finally meet around the midpoint of the novel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReamDe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReamDe">Ream De</a></em> does this in a big way. It starts off with Russian mobsters abducting a girl and several other people who were unwittingly involved in the mob losing millions of dollars to Chinese hackers. After getting dragged to China with the Russian hit squad, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the girl gets abducted by Jihadist terrorists in the apartment one story above the hackers. The rest of the story involves various friends, family and government forces trying to stop the terrorists and rescue the girl</span>.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoneGirl">Gone Girl</a></em>. The novel is told from both Nick and Amy's perspectives. Nick is in the present day, trying to cope with being the main culprit in his wife's disappearance, while Amy's diary entries tell the story of a crumbling marriage. In the second half of the story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> we learn that Amy's diary was a complete fabrication, all part of an elaborate scheme to frame her husband</span>. From there, the story gets a little more <em>interesting...</em>
</li><li> <em>Room</em> is about a woman who was kidnapped as a teenager and gave birth to a son while in captivity. The child, Jack, thinks that their prison (or 'Room', as he calls it) is all that exists in the world, while his mother tries to enforce these beliefs for him, although dire circumstances eventually force her to tell the truth. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then they escape, and the rest of the story is about the two of them trying to adapt to the real world after everything they've gone through.</span>
</li><li> The first part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlouettesSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlouettesSong">Alouette's Song</a></em> is a techno-thriller about the discovery of a potential means of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FasterThanLightTravel">Faster-Than-Light Travel</a> and the subterfuge from a secret government agency that wants to suppress it. At almost exactly the halfway point, the starship is built, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the heroes beat the primary villain in space and are just about to apprehend him</span>, only for them to accidentally enter warp drive and wind up embroiled in an interplanetary war on the other side of the Galaxy. The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkylarkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkylarkSeries">Skylark Series</a> was also split into a terrestrial and an extraterrestrial half, but when they first arrive in space there are several smaller vignettes before they encounter the aliens so that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingConflict">Rising Conflict</a> is more gradual. These scenes were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">cut out</a> of <em>Alouette's Song</em>, and therefore the book reads like two separate stories with their own climaxes, told one after another.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Madeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Madeline">Madeline</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first half of the original book is just about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">everyday lives</a> of Madeline, her schoolmates, and Miss Clavel. Then suddenly Madeline is stricken with appendicitis and the rest of the plot revolves around her stay at the hospital.
</li><li> <em>Madeline in London</em> at first revolves around Pepito's unhappiness at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovingExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovingExperience">having to move to London</a> and leave Madeline and the other girls behind. But when Madeline and friends come to visit him for his birthday, the rest of the plot involves their misadventures with the horse they buy as a present for him.
</li><li> <em>Madeline's Christmas</em> starts out with Miss Clavel and all the girls except Madeline having colds on Christmas Eve and needing Madeline to take care of them, but then switches the focus to an Arabian rug merchant, who sells all his rugs to the girls only to get chilled without them, is nursed by Madeline, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaterInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaterInstallmentWeirdness">turns out to be a magician and makes his rugs fly all the girls home to their parents for the holidays.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WutheringHeights">Wuthering Heights</a></em> is a famous example. The first half is a more-or-less conventional tragic love story (albeit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">very morally ambiguous characters</a> and a strange, mystical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasochismTango" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasochismTango">brutally codependent</a> emotional twinship in place of normal romantic love) between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, ending with Catherine's death. The second half takes place after a long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, focuses on the now-adolescent children of the previous main characters, and casts Heathcliff in the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a>, manipulating and abusing his niece-by-marriage, son and ward to complete his revenge on the Earnshaw and Linton families. The two halves are so distinct that most screen and stage adaptations easily cut the second half and only adapt the Heathcliff/Catherine love story.

<ul><li> The two-part finale of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun">3rd Rock from the Sun</a></em> is about the aliens experiencing dreams for the first time (with elaborate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeDimensionalEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeDimensionalEpisode">Three Dimensional</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequences</a>) and thinking they're going mad. This ends up as a season-ending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a> in which Sally, Tommy, and Harry have left Earth without Dick. When they return at the start of the next season, they've brought another alien (Roseanne Barr) who has been assigned Dick's wife by the Big Giant Head. The rest of the two-part season premiere is about this storyline. So essentially, it's a four-part episode in which the first two parts are about something completely different than the concluding two parts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first season this was enforced because they only had a 13 episode contract to start, so the plot begins at Midnight and every threat is resolved by 1 PM. When the series was extended, they dropped in a Sequel Hook scene and continued the plot from there.
</li><li> The first half is either the first phase of the terrorist attack or is a diversion that was meant to waste their time but that would still be deadly if Jack Bauer didn't save the morning!
</li><li> In Series 6, Islamic terrorists detonate a nuclear bomb, killing 12000 people and destroying Valencia. However, this plot thread quickly drops from focus in favor of stopping the Chinese from obtaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> that would give them control of Russia's nuclear arsenal and spark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Has happened three seasons in a row with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em> at the fall/spring season transition.
<ul><li> Season two has Whitehall's faction of HYDRA being destroyed, with the second half of the season centering on the introduction of the Inhumans and the conflict with the "Real" SHIELD.
</li><li> Season three has Ward killed and SHIELD's issues with the ATCU resolved, with the second half centering around Hive escaping from his prison and taking over HYDRA.
</li><li> Season four has the Ghost Rider plotline wrapped up, Daisy returning to SHIELD, and the old guard possibly coming to an accord with the new Director, only for Ada to start behaving dangerously, possibly as a result of reading the Darkhold.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> did this in the 2nd and 4th seasons.
<ul><li> The 2nd season was more explicit, with the central arc of the season revolving around Angel's arc based around saving Darla and his vengeance against Wolfram and Hart ending early in the 16th episode, with the following two episodes somewhat wrapping up the aftermath. The next four episodes after that involve a complete shift in storyline to Lorne's homeworld and the rescue of Fred Burkle.
</li><li> The fourth season builds around the coming of the Beast to bring darkness and destruction to LA, and the gang discovering out that Cordelia was possessed by some kind of evil being and was the Beast's master. Once again, this story reaches its finale in episode 17 when Cordelia manages to give birth to a magical offspring. While still tangentally connected to this earlier plotline, the offspring is a fully-grown woman named Jasmine who is seemingly benevolent and intending to bring world peace while hiding a dark secret, and the plotline stands completely on its own. The last episode represents yet another switch as Jasmine has been defeated in the prior episode, and the season finale is instead spent setting up the following season.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> usually did this whenever bringing in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>
<ul><li> Season Two pulled two switches: First, it seemed like the Anointed One would be targeting her the full season to avenge the Master's death in the previous season, only for Spike and Drusilla to come in just a few episodes later. They were the main adversaries on the show for a while until halfway through the season where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Buffy and Angel consummate their relationship, and in turn cause Angel to lose his soul and turn evil</span>.
</li><li> Season Three set up Mr. Trick as the main antagonist for the first few episodes, only to bring the Mayor of Sunnydale in and recruit Trick. Then Trick dies halfway through the season and the real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> approaches the Mayor with an offer he can't refuse...
</li><li> Season Four had Buffy constantly running across the secret organization the Initiative... then halfway through their creation, Adam awakes and busts out of the place.
</li><li> Season Six had a very late switch. Most of it was spent on the gang coping with their self-destructive behavior and life tearing each of them apart while also dealing with a pain in the ass trio of geeks trying to rub them out for the heck of it. And then by episode 19, it looks like everything's wrapped up. Buffy's finally getting her life in control, the trio's been disbanded, Willow and Tara have reconciled... wait a minute, there's still three episodes left in the season, isn't there? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ex-leader Warren shows up and winds up shooting both Buffy and Tara, killing the latter... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">which leaves Willow becoming one very pissed off</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">vengeful</a> witch.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The first five or six episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CougarTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CougarTown">Cougar Town</a></em> are about Jules entering the world of the cougar, and after that, the show shifts to a more ensemble-y show about Jules and her family and friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E6TheArk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS3E6TheArk">"The Ark"</a> opens as a story about how the Doctor and his companions inadvertently introduce a deadly virus among the last survivors of humanity and try to put right their error as quickly as possible so that there are no long-term consequences... Except there clearly are as the second half of the story, set thousands of years later, makes very clear: the erstwhile servant race of Monoids have managed to enslave the humans as a result.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E6TheSeedsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E6TheSeedsOfDoom">"The Seeds of Doom"</a> starts as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThing1982">The Thing (1982)</a></em>-like story about three scientists in Antarctica recovering an alien plant and unwittingly causing great danger to the rest of Earth. The Doctor gets called in to help and arrives after one of the scientists is infected, with the resulting story apparently centering around the Doctor and Sarah having to work with the remaining scientists to stop the plant. By the second part, all three of the scientists have been killed and the base gets blown up, destroying the plant. The rest of the serial focuses on the Doctor and Sarah Jane trying to stop a second plant that's now in the possession of a mad herbologist living in an estate in England.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E7KillTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E7KillTheMoon">"Kill the Moon"</a> starts off as a bit of a Classic <em>Who</em> pastiche about the companions and guest characters getting the Base Under Siege treatment from giant orange spiders. There's a ton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCavalcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCavalcade">Continuity Cavalcade</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalHomage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InternalHomage">Internal Homage</a> for ancient stories like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E6TheMoonbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS4E6TheMoonbase">"The Moonbase"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E2TheArkInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS12E2TheArkInSpace">"The Ark in Space"</a>, just to make sure we get the point. At the midpoint of the episode, the story abruptly turns into a drama in which the characters earnestly debate the ethics of an allegorical abortion <em>and</em> whether the Doctor has any business deciding the fate of humanity for it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS38E5FugitiveOfTheJudoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS38E5FugitiveOfTheJudoon">"Fugitive of the Judoon"</a> starts off being about the titular thuggish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice">Space Police</a> menacing Gloucester while looking for a fugitive. Once the fugitive is identified, the Judoon take a backseat as the plot shifts to the mystery around the fugitive's true identity.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>, when a character-oriented episode will be interrupted by a large-scale medical emergency which will provide the drama for the rest of the episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em> 's "A Christmassy Ted" starts off being about the characters getting prepared for Christmas, which involves getting lost in the largest lingerie section in Ireland. Halfway through the plot changes to being about Ted being eligible for a Golden Cleric award. Graham Linehan has admitted the plots would have worked better as separate episodes.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> episode "Grand Gift Auto" spends its first two acts revolving Joey buying a stolen car and getting questioned by an officer. The third act revolves around Joey considering moving out, feeling that the Tanners see him as nothing but a joke, and the family trying to convince him that they really do care about him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodLife">The Good Life</a></em> episode "The Windbreak War" details the, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">yes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar">Escalating War</a> over the eponymous garden ornament.. until Jerry forces everyone to sit down and <em>talk</em> about it, after which they all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntoxicationEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntoxicationEnsues">get plastered</a> on Tom's homemade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster">Gargle Blaster</a> and start hitting on each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Homeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Homeland">Homeland</a></em> is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Deuteragonists</a> Brodie, a celebrated but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">shell-shocked</a> veteran of questionable sanity, and Carrie, a bipolar CIA agent who secretly investigates Brodie. After three seasons, Brodie's story has run its course. From the fourth season on, the show is only about Carrie's continuing and largely unrelated adventures trying to balance her life, psyche, and career.
</li><li> Season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS">House of Cards (US)</a></em> starts by continuing on from the end of season 3. After Frank recovers from getting shot by Lucas Goodwin in an assassination attempt a third of the way through the season, the plot switches to Frank scheming with Claire as part of a reinvigorated election cycle.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a></em>, where Decade is the destroyer of worlds, is outlined in the first episode. The rest of the series is about Tsukasa visiting alternate Rider worlds and solving their problem of the week, all the while wondering why people think he's the "destroyer of worlds." We don't actually get back to that plot until the last episodes and the second movie. The first movie and some of the last episodes didn't exactly help as they introduced a new plot in the form of Dai-Shocker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> is fond of this, especially as seasons continue. They often end up handling cases that only look sexual that change halfway into something completely unrelated. They never bother to explain why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything">the non-special victims case isn't handed to another department</a>.
<ul><li> One example is the episode "Vulnerable", which starts out as a case about an old woman being sexually assaulted and turns into a tangentially related storyline about another, non-sexual victim in a nursing home where the first victim just happened to be.
</li><li> Another example is "Responsible" where the entire reason for SVU to be there was "We found her on a bed that had ejaculate on it" and any sexual motive was ruled out <em>right after the opening credits</em> so that the plot could dive into an examination of teenage drinking. Although technically it could be considered a child endangerment case (which is SVU territory if I remember) because they were minors.
</li><li> An even worse one would be "Wildlife" where they were called to a case because a bodily fluid was found on a victim: saliva. The murder weapon was described as a number of sharp uneven pointed things (obviously teeth) and there did not appear to be any sexual aspect to the crime. This did not stop them from investigating animal smugglers which resulted in them nearly blowing an FBI investigation getting an innocent man (and his pet tiger) eaten by wild hyenas and having Elliot shot (granted it was implied he took the case so he would not have to spend time with his family).
</li><li> Possibly the weirdest, though, was the one that had what looked like a case of child molestation <em>somehow</em> turn out to actually be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a> to test new poisons on poor immigrants, essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">For the Evulz</a>.
</li><li> In a slightly more reasonable case, "Liberties" starts off as a story about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">stalker</a> who set his ex-girlfriend/stalkee up to be raped, but takes a turn when the judge in the case asks Elliot to find the body of the judge's murdered son. Though the rape case is largely sidelined in favor of the latter arc, there does turn out to be a connection between the two halves of the plot.

The team successfully kills/arrests the terrorists, but the episode ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an explosion that kills Mossad Officer Hadar and sends NCIS Director Vance to the hospital</span>. "Enemies Domestic" then focuses on Vance's first NCIS mission to Amsterdam, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> someone from that op was responsible for the explosion</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceCameraAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceCameraAction">Police, Camera, Action!</a></em> was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Documentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Documentary">Documentary</a> that aired from 1994 to 2002, and 2007 to 2010, but used this trope fairly regularly. Let's go through them step-by-step:
<ul><li> "The Wild Side", which aired in January 1998, started out by discussing swans on the motorway and other wild animals, but after the commercial break, went into the dangers of driving while tired, and new police methods to stop stolen cars in London and a hostage situation in Dyfed-Powys area of Wales.
</li><li> "Rust Buckets", which aired October 1998. After the first sequence of clips about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a> ("rust bucket" is British slang for the alleged car), it then discussed a police pursuit in Blackbird Leys, Oxfordshire, before focusing on the Scottish Highlands, foreign drivers on British roads, and drivers behaving foolishly.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens in a couple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> episodes, including the Series VIII finale: the first half is about how Lister and Kryten playing pranks on each other turns into a potentially lethal situation... then halfway through they discover that a virus is eating the ship, most of the crew evacuates, and our heroes have to cross into a mirror universe to find the antidote. This <em>was</em> set up at the very beginning of the episode, but most of the events from the first half have no effect on the second half.
<ul><li> In the episode "Emohawk: Polymorph II" it happens <em>twice</em>. First, the crew is being chased by a rogue Space Corps police probe... this leads them to crash onto a Gelf moon, where they have to deal with the locals to fix their ship's oxygen system... this leads them to being back on the ship with the titular emohawk on the loose. Apart from the connections mentioned above, none of the previous parts have any effect on each new plot.
</li><li> The first episode uses this, as well. The first half of the episode is a general snapshot of the routine on board the <em>Dwarf</em> and an introduction to some of the technology they have. The second half is, well... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave">Everybody's Dead, Dave</a>.
</li><li> "Justice" begins with the crew finding a stasis pod drifting in space. They determine that it came from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonShip">Prison Ship</a> and contains either a living human woman or a murderous simulant — and it will open automatically in a matter of hours. They go to the prison station to learn more, only for the prison's AI to scan their minds and find Rimmer guilty of causing the accident that killed Red Dwarf's crew. Most of the episode is then devoted to getting Rimmer released. That done, they decide to head home...
<div class="indent"><strong>The Cat:</strong> Come on, let's get out of here. I don't know what made us want to come to this hellhole in the first place! <br/><strong>Lister:</strong> (staring at the now-open pod) <em>I</em> do.
</div><ul><li> In the end, the key to defeating the new threat is in how Rimmer dealt with imprisonment.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ResurrectionErtugrul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ResurrectionErtugrul">Resurrection Ertugrul</a></em>: Season 3 starts off revolving Ertugrul getting involved in the trade process by setting up shop in the Hanli Bazaar, as well as his subsequent rivalry with Ural Bey. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then Ural kills the market owner, and the governor of Karacahisar embargoes the Kayi goods that were supposed to arrive in his city,</span> thus changing the direction of the arc from that point on. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And thats not even discussing the fact that season 4 picks up <em>directly</em> after the events of the season 3 finale</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> has had a couple of examples where two plots that couldn't each fill up an episode were joined together.
<ul><li> "Up The Long Ladder" starts with the <em>Enterprise</em> evacuating an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oireland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oireland">Oireland-style</a> colony, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a> hijinks. They then visit a second colony populated by clones that are only a few generations away from losing genetic integrity — and the solution is to integrate both groups of colonists into one.
</li><li> "Sins Of The Father" starts with a Klingon officer named Kurn coming aboard the <em>Enterprise</em> as part of an ongoing exchange program and taking his post as temporary First Officer. What looks like an episode of the crew chafing under his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a> attitude changes course when he reveals himself to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostRelative">Worf's younger brother</a>, and brings news that their deceased father Mogh is being falsely accused of treason. The rest of the episode is a Klingon-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomEpisode">Courtroom Episode</a> as Worf fights to clear Mogh's name and restore his family's honor.

<ul><li> The first few minutes of Episode 2 finish the cliffhanger from the first episode, then becomes a focus episode on Shouji trying to redeem himself for letting a kid get kidnapped by the Gorma.
</li><li> The first half of Episode 3 focuses on Shouji and Kazu, while the second switches to Daigo.
</li></ul></li><li> In episode 24 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger">Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger</a></em> Umeko interrogated an alien about a bomb; then the rest of the episode was about the alien, and they only picked it up at the end.
</li><li> An episode of Turboranger subverts this. It seems to do this with the earlier problem of Youhei being poisoned by the monster of the week being quickly overshadowed 5 minutes later by the fact that in attempts to recover the antidote for him Haruna received a blow to the skull and now thinks she's part of the bad guys with poor Youhei forgotten about. However, it turns out Haruna was only fooling to get the antidote and both plots wind up tying together after all.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVicarOfDibley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVicarOfDibley">The Vicar of Dibley</a></em>: The first part of the episode "Summer" deals with the people of Dibley suffering a severe water shortage during a heatwave, with barely enough water to drink and certainly not enough to wash; one scene shows Geraldine and Alice wearing old Halloween costumes because they're the only clean outfits they have left. Halfway through, though, we learn that the local council's solution to this problem is to flood Dibley for a water reservoir, and the rest of the episode deals with the fight to save the village, with no further mention of the problem that led to this in the first place — indeed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">all evidence of the shortage disappears after this point.</a>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a>'s song <em>Poisoning Pigeons in the Park</em> starts out as your typical ballad about the wonders of spring... and then in the first chorus suddenly moves on to being about, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">poisoning pigeons in the park</a>.
<ul><li> Also <em>I Hold Your Hand In Mine</em> which starts out like a regular love song but then reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the hand isn't attached to her body</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>' <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_in_the_Life">"A Day in the Life"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is the ultimate Halfway Plot Switch song. Paul even confesses that the middle part was a piano piece that he was initially working on independently.
</li><li> "Charming Weather" from Lionel Monckton's <em>The Arcadians</em>. It starts off obviously leading into a marriage proposal — until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they realise they aren't alone</span>, and it turns into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> banal smalltalk</span> for the chorus. Unusual since, being music, it can <em>do it all over a second time</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> has a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2_mEwNq86M">rather badly performed recording of it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Katrinah Jospehina by <a class="urllink" href="http://www.universalhallpass.com">Universal Hall Pass.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The first half of the song is the tale of a girl (the eponymous Katrinah) who decided to explore beneath the earth. The second half consists of a twisted, echoing beat accompanying backwards-sounding fragments of the lyrics. This change is never really explained, but it's heavily implied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Katrinah is either mentally ill or trapped in hell... or both</span>.
</li><li> Arlo Guthrie starts out "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlicesRestaurant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlicesRestaurant">The Alice's Restaurant Massacree</a>" by telling about how he was arrested for littering on Thanksgiving, but he switches halfway through to talk about going to visit the draft board. Eventually it all ties together.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Gorillaz">Gorillaz</a>'s Empire Ants song, in the new Plastic Beach album. It starts with 2D singing, backed by sweet almost lift-like tropical tunes. Then, full stop, and it starts what appears a new song, with electro-techno sounds, bass, and even new vocals, from guest artist Little Dragon. And it's awesome.
</li><li> "Miserable Lie" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSmiths">The Smiths</a> seems constructed out of <em>three</em> separate songs, opening with a slow, gentle, serious introduction that seems to represent the end of a relationship. The song then turns on a dime to an uptempo number with a series of bitter, (yet comical) stream-of-consciousness lyrics. This shift in tone gets escalated to a manic level in the final part of the track, as Morrissey switches to a falsetto voice, howling about his perceived inadequacies in life and love. It can be argued that the <em>theme</em> of the lyrics stays constant, but then again, said theme is dominant in most of The Smiths' songs, as well as Morrissey's solo work.
</li><li> The Good, The Bad and The Queen's song, Three Changes. It doesn't take a genius to see why it's named like that. The song starts and goes all well, up after the second chorus, and it switches to a Latin-like song, and later, it changes into a slower and minimalistic version of the first part. So there's only two changes?
</li><li> The first half of Laserdance's 1995 album <em>The Guardian of Forever</em> is the same style as the previous two albums, but halfway through it undergoes a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> to tech-trance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>'s "Cygnet Committee" starts with the singer bemoaning the intellectual passengers in his circle and shifts into a tale of that circle leading a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution">Full-Circle Revolution</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>'s "Scenes from an Italian Restaurant" switches tone and subject three times. The first and final sections are about the restaurant, or more accurately its wine list. This restaurant is not mentioned in either of the other two more upbeat sections, one of which is about a teenage romance that eventually turned into a failed marriage. Also, the original title was "The Ballad of Brenda and Eddie" (The two teens the third section is about), according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>.
</li><li> The song "A Fair Day's Work" from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a> Oratorio <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian">Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)</a></em> starts off as a silly song in which a man on death row praises the social benefits of capital punishment. Then he goes on about how everyone must pull their weight in society as part of the reason why capital punishment is necessary (this is where the title comes from), and then finally changes subject again to discuss what he did for a living before ending up being sentenced to die by crucifixion for unspecified reasons. Since the career in question was lumberjack and this was made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a>, this naturally transitions into a monologue about crossdressing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Scorpions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Scorpions">Scorpions</a> "Coming Home" starts out as a soft acoustic ballad then about halfway through suddenly changes into full-on heavy metal.
</li><li> 5 Seconds of Summer's "She's Kinda Hot" starts out about a guy who's annoyed by his girlfriend but only stays with her because, well, "she's kinda hot". Then in the second verse, it randomly switches to being about the narrator's friend dropping out of college because he has "bigger plans", then for the chorus, it becomes an anthem of empowerment for losers and outcasts.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale">The Winter's Tale</a></em> consists of a first half that is tragedy and a second half that is comedy.

(Either way, '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Exit pursued by a bear</a>' is around where the shift happens.)
</li><li> The first half of <em>Edward III</em> is a romantic drama, verging on romantic comedy, as King Edward attempts to seduce the Countess of Salisbury. When she refused him, he returns to the wars, and the rest is a standard war history play.
</li><li> The first act of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em> is the story of plucky, incredibly intelligent revolutionary soldier Alexander Hamilton as he fights his way through the American Revolution. From "Yorktown" on, the second act follows Hamilton's rise to power in the new American government before his untimely death. Justified in that that's actually what happened in the life of Alexander Hamilton, but still, the two halves are so separate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingForTwo">four main/supporting characters can disappear from the show entirely, and four new main/supporting characters have to be introduced the moment they're gone</a>.

The player spends roughly the first two hours playing as Solid Snake, the protagonist from the previous game. Then the plot moves forward two years, to a different location, with the player in control of an entirely new character (ambiguously implied to be Snake for the first few minutes) for the rest of the game.

</li><li> Lampshaded again in the episode "A Tale of Two Springfields", which is about a badger invading the Simpsons' back yard, until Homer tries to call animal control but fails, at which point the plot focuses on Springfield being split into two area codes, eventually resulting in the town itself splitting in two with Homer as the mayor of his side of town, and climaxes with a concert by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a></em>, of all things. When the badger comes back, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEnemy">Homer is able to casually wave it off</a> since it is now just interfering with the plot:
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer</strong>: Go away! We have bigger problems now!
</div></li><li> The plot of "Homerazzi": Homer being too sick to blow out candles which causes a fire which causes the family to get a fire-proof safe in which the family album is burned which causes them to retake all of their photos in which they take a picture of a celebrity scandal and become paparazzi.
</li><li> "Tennis the Menace" opens with Grandpa winning a free autopsy when he dies. This simply provides the buildup to Homer <em>buying a tennis court</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer</strong>: I bet you didn't see <em>that</em> coming.
</div></li><li> A notably clever use of this is the episode "Jazzy and the Pussycats", Bart takes up the drums. At a jazz brunch, he overshadows Lisa's performance, making her envious. To make her feel better, Marge lets her adopt a puppy from the animal shelter. This springboards into her rescuing <em>lots</em> of abandoned animals, including former circus tigers. Then one of the tigers bites Bart's arm, stopping him from playing the drums again.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lisa</strong>: All I wanted was to save those animals while Bart became a drummer, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperlinkStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperlinkStory">I never thought the two stories would intersect</a>!
</div></li><li> One of the show's most infamous examples of this came when Maude Flanders died in "Alone Again, Natura-Diddly". The episode jumped tracks from the Simpsons taking a nature walk to them having a day out at a racetrack, then Maude died in an accident, and the episode became one about Ned coping with his loss. Arguably has another one if you consider "Homer tries to set Ned up with someone new" to be a different plot.
</li><li> Lampshaded in "Brawl in the Family" where the first bit involves a social worker fixing the family's problems. By the time they've resolved it, Lisa wonders it was the "end of our series... of adventures". They then arrive back home to find Homer's Vegas wife from several episodes before at the house. The social worker quickly leaves, and the bigamy plot takes up the rest of the episode.
</li><li> "Homer The Moe" begins with Bart digging a hole for some inexplicable reason, which turns out to be one of Homer's crazy bar stories, then the plot becomes about Moe losing passion for bartending and returning to college while Homer takes over the bar, then the story takes another shift with Moe remodeling the bar into an upscale nightclub and alienating himself from Homer, Lenny and Carl, then Homer opens his own bar in his garage and finally the plot hinted at in the episode title gets started 2/3s through the episode.
</li><li> The plot of "Crook and Ladder" starts with Marge taking away Maggie's pacifier and Maggie destroying the house as a result, then Maggie gets calmed down with Santa's Little Helper's squeaky dog toy, only the squeaking leads to Homer being unable to sleep, so he takes sleeping pills and becomes a "zombie" of sorts and Bart and Milhouse take advantage of him, which then causes Homer to accidentally crash into the fire department and injure all the volunteer firefighters, and FINALLY the main plot of Homer and his friends becoming firefighters gets underway.
</li><li> Season 12's "HOMR" starts off with the family at the "Totally Sick, Twisted, F***ed-Up Animation Festival", where we have a lot of little skits, including a claymation parody of Davey and Goliath. Then Homer is asked to wear a motion capture suit and act as a cartoon dog. He's a hit with the audience and is so impressed that he decides to invest in the Animotion company. However, when their stocks lower significantly, he has to get a job as a human guinea pig, where the testers are shocked by his remarkable stupidity. They then find a crayon lodged in his brain from an incident when he was younger. He gets it taken out, and THEN the main plot starts of Homer becoming smarter, until the end when he gets it put back in again. Notably, all this does not affect the episode's pacing.
</li><li> "The Winter of His Content" focuses on Grampa and his friends staying with the family at 742 Evergreen Terrace and the effects that has on Homer's lifestyle, but is then taken over by a completely unrelated plot involving Bart and the school bullies which parodies the cult classic film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWarriors">The Warriors</a></em>. The first plot is brought back at the end as a resolution to the second one, but not in a way that really resolves itself.
</li><li> Subverted in "E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt)", where after Homer gets involved in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernGentleman">Southern Gentleman</a>, he and the family run off to his family's old farm to hide out. After going through the episode involving them inadvertently creating a new plant called tomacco (half tomato/half tobacco), they return home, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">find the Southerner</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">still</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">waiting for Homer</a>, forcing him to finally duel (and get shot in the arm).
</li><li> Somewhat more of a 'third act switch', but "Mona Leaves-A" had Homer dealing with the drama of his mother returning one more time to his life, and then the drama that ensues when she dies and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret">Parting Words Regret</a> is that he wanted her to leave because he was tired of her constant running from the law and leaving him behind (once even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">making him think she had died</a>). In order to try to feel better, he obeyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryMeNotOnTheLonePrairie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryMeNotOnTheLonePrairie">her final request on where to release her ashes to the letter...</a> and then it turned out that the instructions were part of her plot to sabotage Burns' attempt to launch nuclear waste into the Amazon Forest from a secret ICBM base (<em>with said ashes</em>). The story, thus, turned the final five minutes of the episode into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a> pastiche.
</li><li> The sub-plot of Season 29's "Grampy Can Ya Hear Me" was initially set up to be about Bart and Lisa breaking into school to change a wrong answer in Lisa's test, but it soon focuses on Principal Skinner resenting his mother for not letting him join a marching band.
</li><li> "E Pluribus Wiggum" starts with the Fast-Food Boulevard being destroyed by a chain-reaction explosion caused by Homer Simpson, and then Mayor Quimby decides to place it's rebuilding as a bond issue on the next election's ballot. Lenny then convinces Quimby to move the primary to the next week, causing Springfield to have an early primary. Then Ralph Wiggum becomes a presidental candidate and the original plot is quickly, if not totally, forgotten.
</li><li> In "Weekend At Burnsie's", the main plot doesn't get underway until the start of the second act. The first act has the following lead-in subplots: Marge tries serving genetically modified vegetables -&gt; Marge sets up her own vegetable garden and makes a scarecrow -&gt; Homer wrecks the scarecrow and befriends the crows -&gt; The crows ultimately attack Homer -&gt; Homer gets hooked on medicinal marijuana. In fact, this is lampshaded early on in the third act...
<div class="indent"><strong>Marge:</strong> Homie, you don't need drugs anymore. Your eyes are all better.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Homer:</strong> Eyes? What the hell are you talking about?
</div></li><li> "The Frying Game" is yet another episode that switches gears twice. It begins with Homer buying a koi pond that attracts an increadibly annoying "screamapillar" that the family is now legally obligated to take care of. After Homer accidentally injures it, he gets sentences to community service where he (and later, Marge) is taken advantage of by an old woman who guilts him into do all her chores. It's only when the old woman is murdered that the plot gets serious, as Homer and Marge become the prime suspects.
</li><li> "The Canine Mutiny" starts off with Bart's credit card fraud, then moves to him buying another dog. When his card is revealed to be fake, he gives up Santa's Little Helper instead of his new dog. The third act of the episode focuses on Bart trying to get Santa's Little Helper back from a blind man's house.
</li><li> "Dude, Where's My Ranch?" starts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, where Homer is trying to think of a new Christmas carol. He then makes it about Flanders and how much he hates him, and the song becomes a hit sensation. Homer gets so sick of hearing it that he moves to a nearby ranch to avoid his song, and the episode shifts into a Wild West-style plot about the family living on the ranch as cowboys.
</li><li> "Fat Man and Little Boy" starts with a plot about Bart's loose tooth. Once he removes it, he realizes that he isn't a "kid" anymore and abandons all his toys. This cynical attitude leads him to create T-shirts with sarcastic sayings. Once Bart's shirts become popular, Homer focuses his attention on Lisa and helps her build a nuclear reactor.
</li><li> The first act of "Marge vs. Singles, Seniors, Childless Couples, and Teens, and Gays" revolves around Maggie's obsession with a children's song. When the family goes to a concert to hear the song, it ends in a riot, which leads into a plot of the town of Springfield hating kids and ruining everything that used to be kid-friendly.
</li><li> In "Strong Arms of the Ma", Marge gets mugged and becomes reclusive and scared to step outside. Having nothing else to do, she begins exercising, and the second half of the episode revolves around how strong she is.
</li><li> The first act of "C. E. D'oh" is about how Homer feels that Marge doesn't like him anymore. While taking a class to fix this problem, he is kicked out and ends up in an investing and business class, leading to the second and third act's plot about Homer becoming the owner of the power plant.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one episode, they go through several plots in rapid succession: Peter ruins his suit, and buys some adult-size footy pajamas, he becomes a faux-superhero by rubbing his feet on the carpet and shocking people, a fed-up Lois rips up all the carpet in the house, and finds a coin worth a lot of money, which the Griffins use to open a restaurant, the restaurant then becomes a favorite of crippled people, Peter bans the cripples and fights against them and then (after refusing to help Peter after he badmouthed Ben Stiller in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gag</a> from earlier in the episode by saying that his movies are terrible) becomes crippled himself. The remainder of the plot is devoted to him coming to terms with being in a wheelchair and apologizing to Joe for banning him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in one episode. Peter takes Brian to the vet and gets the ownership of a parrot while there, which inspires him to become a pirate, and he finds three pirate buddies. They attack a car filled with spices, and the parrot dies in the resulting fight. Chris, who has a crush on the receptionist, tells her Peter will just find some other wacky adventure. Indeed, he finds a pipe organ immediately, and when he breaks that ten seconds later, the deeds to a cattle ranch. The rest of the episode ignored Peter's hijinks in favor of Chris' relationship with her. To make matters worse, this particular episode is named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeTitle">"Long John Peter"</a> and the promotional <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/familyguy/images/e/ec/FGLongJohnPeter.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20080419023522">poster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> makes the pirate-theme out to be the main focus of the episode.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a>, then averted, in "Welcome Back, Carter", an episode which mostly sticks to one plot. After repairing the relationship between Lois' parents, and in the last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">five seconds</a>, Peter exclaims, "Hey, I found a magic lamp! No? Maybe next episode."
</li><li> "Episode 420" starts with Peter "accidentally" killing Quagmire's cat. On the way to burying it and hiding the evidence, Peter and Brian are stopped by a cop, who is completely oblivious to the dead cat and the shovel in the back but charges Brian with possession of marijuana. The rest of the episode is about Brian trying to get marijuana legalized, then Peter and Carter trying to get it illegal again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> at the very end, when Quagmire goes to the Griffins' house and tells Peter about the new reward for finding his missing cat, Peter tells Quagmire that he killed his cat, takes the reward money, and slams the door on him; the audience had most likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">already forgotten about the cat by that point</a>.
</li><li> "I Dream of Jesus" starts with Peter being obsessed with his Surfin' Bird record and annoying everyone with it until Brian and Stewie steal and destroy it in true <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OfficeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OfficeSpace">Office Space</a></em> fashion. Peter goes to a record store to find a replacement and finds Jesus working at the register. Following that scene, Surfin' Bird is never brought up again until the end of the episode. Talk about bookending plot-points.
</li><li> "Wasted Talent" starts off as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholePlotReference">Whole Plot Reference</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</a></em>, but after Peter angers Pawtucket Pat by going into the forbidden room and gets kicked off the tour, Lois notices that he's a great piano player whenever he's drunk.
</li><li> Zigzagged with "Christmas Guy" as it starts with Peter trying to get Carter into the joys of Christmas, once the first half of the plot has already been resolved, it focuses more on Stewie missing Brian.
</li><li> "Peter-Assment" starts with Stewie getting stage fright, but then, rather than setting up a b-story focusing on him trying to conquer his stage fright, the rest of the episode focuses on Peter becoming a paparazzi, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Peter being sexually harassed by his boss</a> in order to keep his job.
</li><li> "April in Quahog" has three plots in one episode. First having Peter attempt to get out of Jury Duty after finding out it's a civic duty rather than an exclusive selection. It later switches to the Earth getting sucked in a black hole and everyone in Quahog trying to live out the last 24 hours of their lives. When it turns out the whole thing was an April Fools joke by the news crew, the last ten minutes of the episode is Peter trying to win back his children's respect after admitting they get in the way all the time.
</li><li> Passenger Fatty-Seven starts with Peter ditching Lois to go on a trip to California with the guys, and then turns into a plot about the plane being hijacked by terrorists from an unidentified Eastern European country.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">The Jetsons</a></em> does this, with the first half featuring a plot about George trying to get the day off from Mr. Spacely and the second half befriending a bunch of alien circus fleas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "The Cryonic Woman", the first part of the episode is about Fry, Bender, and Leela losing their jobs at Planet Express, but that plot is dropped in favor of Fry's reunion with his old girlfriend. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> issue of getting their jobs back is only picked up at the end.
</li><li> The first two episode-length quarters of "Bender's Game" are about the Planet Express crew trying to stop Mom from getting a special die. The second two quarters are pretty much the same plot again, in the crazy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> reality that Bender's accidentally created.

</li><li> The second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em>, "Episode Two: Election Blu-Galoo". The whole episode centers around the student body presidential election, but the only reason JFK runs is to abolish term limits and reinstate Cleopatra. By the time Abe enters the race, JFK and Cleo's plan is completely discarded for the story of Abe and JFK's competition for Cleo's affection. By the end of the episode Cleo's presidential ambitions have evaporated in favour of seducing whoever's in office, a plotline abandoned within the first two minutes of the next episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> did this in the short "The Warners and the Beanstalk." It starts out appropriately as a retelling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackAndTheBeanstalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JackAndTheBeanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a></em> (also showing some influence from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FunAndFancyFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FunAndFancyFree">Disney's version</a>), but then they persuade the Giant (played by Ralph the Guard) to try some gold eggs and meat, which it then becomes a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenEggsAndHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenEggsAndHam">Green Eggs and Ham</a></em>, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhymesOnADime">rhyming dialogue</a>.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies1984">Muppet Babies (1984)</a></em> episodes start this way. The kids are usually involved in some sort of gang or group fantasy, until a little later, something arises (usually started by Nanny) that completely changes the focus of the episode. Such examples include...
<ul><li> "Dental Hijinks" starts with the babies pretending they are in a big auto race until they crash, and Fozzie notices he has a loose tooth, triggering the episode's main plot.
</li><li> "Eight Take Away One Equals Panic" begins with the babies pretending they are flying on an airliner plane until they overhear Nanny on the phone and think she's planning on getting rid of one of them.
</li><li> "Gonzo's Video Show" starts with the babies pretending they are enjoying a day out at the beach until Nanny arrives and lets them borrow her video camera she rented to make some fun videos with it.
</li><li> "Piggy's Hyper-Activity Book" begins with the kids trying to build a house out of cardboard boxes until it collapses, and then the babies decide to play with an activity book, thus getting the main plot underway.
</li><li> "The Muppets Broadcasting Company" starts with the babies trying a domino setup until it leads to an argument. Then a sudden thunderstorm knocks out the power and Gonzo thinks it's an alien invasion. When the babies complain they can't do anything without electricity, Nanny recommends they listen to some classic radio shows she saved on tape cassettes, which gets the main plot underway.
</li><li> "Bad Luck Bear" starts with the babies in the bathtub pretending they are whale-hunting (with Gonzo as the whale) until Fozzie breaks a mirror and everyone believes he has bad luck.
</li><li> "Water Babies" begins with the babies pretending they are in a mine tunnel (actually a series of cardboard boxes) looking for treasure until Nanny comes in with an aquarium of fish. Still, it does carry over into a subplot of Skeeter being more focused on looking for treasure than being interested in the fish.
</li><li> "Where No Muppet Has Gone Before" begins with the babies reenacting Lewis and Clark's expedition to the Pacific until Nanny comes in with Baby Bunsen and Beaker, who have come over to spend the night. Bunsen then begins teaching the babies about space, getting the main plot going.
</li><li> An interesting version in "Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Dark", which starts with the babies playing with Scooter's light pen before it leads into the plot of helping Beaker with his fear of the dark. The light pen ends up becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> in aiding Beaker to overcome the slime monster from his imagination.
</li></ul></li><li> Two animated shorts from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em> starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy">Goofy</a> are like this: One short, called "How to be a Waiter", is actually about Goofy becoming an actor as a result of him being tired of being a waiter (ironically, at the end of the short, it's revealed that the first character Goofy played in his entire film career is yes, a waiter), while another, called "How to Wash Dishes", is actually about Goofy using a credit card to go on vacation as a result of him being tired of washing dishes. However, at the end of the short, Goofy uses up his entire credit card money, and as a result, he had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkOffTheDebt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkOffTheDebt">make up the lost money by yes, washing dishes</a>.

</li><li> "Moooving Day" starts off with Timmy's mom upset that she hasn't sold a house in months, so Timmy has to be persuaded into wishing that she could sell any house. This results in her also selling their own house, as they now can afford to move to the newly-opened Dimmadome Acres. The plot then gradually switches to Timmy finding himself in the middle of a conspiracy where everyone is soon brainwashed by drinking a special brand of milk. When it gets resolved near the end, the original plot is brought up again when everyone needs Timmy's mom to sell them back their houses.

Halfway through the episode, however, Eggman decides he feels better and fires his coach (who disappears from the episode altogether), only to immediately lose his confidence again since he has no one to motivate him and he confines himself to his couch. Sonic then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring">becomes really bored</a> and starts annoying all of his friends, who spend the remainder of the episode trying to bring Eggman's confidence back so he can give Sonic something to do.

<ul><li> <em>Griffon The Brush Off</em> has Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie going on a pranking spree. You may think the outcome will be that one prank goes too far or something, but soon an old friend of Rainbow Dash comes back and the rest of the episode is focused on her.
</li><li> <em>Bats!</em> starts out with pests infesting Sweet Apple Acres and has Applejack who wants to drive them out, arguing with Fluttershy who feels bad for them and wants to let them stay. Then Twilight Sparkle decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a> which results in Fluttershy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">becoming a Vampire Were-Fruit-Bat</a> and the entire story shifts to a Halloween-esque plot about restoring her.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> Valentine's Day episode started off talking about Kim and Ron's first V-Day as a couple, then (much to the disappointment of many Kim/Ron shippers) it shifted to Wade developing a crush on Monique.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the Imaginationland trilogy, terrorists attack Imaginationland plotting to destroy collective imagination. Their means of doing it is to manipulate the Good and Evil characters, who were minding each other's business on their separate turfs of Imaginationland, into a war so they would destroy each other. By Part 2, when the war started, the terrorists are already killed, but the Good characters have the full support. Sure they are literally Good characters, as the Evil characters are literally evil, but the terrorists are responsible for the war when both sides were previously at peace. In the end, the terrorists were supposed to be the only victors, even posthumously, while all the Good and Evil characters were supposed to be dead. However, the Good characters win the war and those of them who died are resurrected. Also, the Evil characters are imprisoned instead of brought back to their turf.
</li><li> The episode "Pinewood Derby" begins with the premise of Randy cheating at the Boy Scouts' Pinewood Derby event through his son Stan. Then, an extraterrestrial criminal on the run lands on Earth and dies, and the rest of the episode is Randy and the leaders of various countries figuring out how to share the fortunes left behind. The plot then switches one more time near the end, where it's revealed that this incident was simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> for humanity as a whole, and Randy's actions caused Earth to fail so hard that the examiners create a force field around Earth and its Moon to keep Earthlings from interfering with other lifeforms in case they master intergalactic travel in the future.

Then <em>Beginnings</em> rolls around, and the focus turns from ending the war to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">preventing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">breaking out of its can</a> and causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Pre-Hibernation Week" has the first five minutes focus on SpongeBob and Sandy doing extreme sports until it suddenly shifts to Sandy forcing the whole town of Bikini Bottom to search for SpongeBob after he had gone missing (he was actually hiding from Sandy so he wouldn't have to join her in any more dangerous stunts).
</li><li> In "Shuffleboarding", the plot starts out with SpongeBob and Patrick filling in for Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy at the shuffleboarding tournament. It quickly turns into a plot about the two arresting everyone in town. The title is even more misleading considering that there wasn't any shuffleboarding shown <em>at all</em>.
</li><li> "Born Again Krabs" starts out with Mr. Krabs trying to make his customers eat a moldy Krabby Patty SpongeBob found under the grill. When no one does, he takes a bite to prove it's still edible and develops a fatal case of food poisoning. When the Flying Dutchman shows up to spirit him away to Davy Jones' Locker as punishment for living a life of stinginess and greed, Mr. Krabs promises to turn over a new leaf if he's spared. The rest of the episode focuses on his efforts to reform himself (at least outwardly) after being brought back to life.
</li><li> "Nasty Patty" starts with Mr. Krabs and Spongebob making sure that the arriving health inspector is treated well and approves the Krusty Krab, only to (mistakenly) assume he's the fake inspector reported by the news, so they make the titular patty as payback. After the inspector chokes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">due to a fly</a>, not the patty), he knocks himself out and Mr. Krabs and Spongebob believe they killed him by mistake, so the plot shifts to them attempting to bury the inspector without the police finding out.
</li><li> "Dirty Bubble Returns" starts with the Dirty Bubble's attack on a power plant, then him being reformed into the Clean Bubble. After a few attempts, he finally reverts to being evil and attacks the town while SpongeBob has to stop him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>:
<ul><li> "The Saint" primarily focuses on Gumball's attempts to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Alan</a> to snap. When this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicJackpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicJackpot">fails spectacularly</a>, Gumball and Darwin spend much of the rest of the episode following Alan's example of saying yes to life, although it doesn't go as well for them as they hoped.
</li><li> "The Countdown" begins as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a>.

It was clear that some kind of plot switch was going to happen from the beginning, however, since the clock starts counting down from six minutes and twenty-three seconds even though a <em>Gumball</em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat">lasts around eleven minutes</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> film "Reality Trip" is set up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade">Broken Masquerade</a> story, with Danny's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a> being revealed during a fight with Freakshow, the hero needing to run from the government's overzealous ghost hunting agents, and getting unexpected help from kids at school who have always been fans of his alter ego. As soon as the main trio escapes the Guys In White, however, Freakshow contacts them and sends them on a mission to recover the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacguffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MineralMacguffin">Mineral Macguffins</a> they were fighting over in the first place. The rest of the movie (until the very end) consists of traveling around the world hunting for the gems, a plot that doesn't rely on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade">Broken Masquerade</a> set-up at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Episode 85 started with Stumpy playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockPaperScissors">RockPaperScissors</a> with the others to see who got to use the bathroom first. Halfway through the episode, the plot randomly changes to Kaeloo and Mr. Cat getting into a fight about whether Kaeloo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">Hulking Out</a> is a good thing or not.
</li><li> The episode "Let's Play Hot-Cold" started with Stumpy trying to make himself look tanned and muscular while Kaeloo tried to find someone to play with and halfway through, the plot became about the others trying to teach Stumpy how to impress girls.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TupTup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/TupTup">Tup Tup</a></em> starts out as a humorous story about a man who is trying to go to sleep at night but is distracted by an annoying sound coming from the apartment below. He yells, he bangs on the floor with a broom. Then he, uh, blows up the whole building, and the story is forgotten. The rest of the cartoon plays out as a series of nonsensical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation">Deranged Animation</a> fantasy imagery reminiscent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPlympton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPlympton">Bill Plympton</a>'s later work.
</li><li> The first part of the last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> focuses on Princess Bubblegum's uncle, Gumbald. After being defeated, the monster Golb appears and the conflict is all about him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres">U.S. Acres</a></em> episode, "Kiddie Korner" begins with Orson Pig narrating the story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorZhivago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorZhivago">Doctor Zhivago</a></em>, with Wade Duck in the titular role.
