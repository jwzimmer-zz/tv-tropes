<ul><li> The Kingdom of Clouds in <em>Doraemon: Nobita and the Kingdom of Clouds</em> prides themselves in having achieved a prosperous civilization without harming the planet while implicitly having a huge technological advantage (e.g by using flying vehicles to rescue animals before they got extinct for centuries). At the time the story takes place (~1992), human pollution is making their kingdom inhabitable, and they have no trouble getting in the high horse and blaming humanity for their thoughtlessness and selfishness. Meanwhile, at no point in the film they even consider lending some of their technology to humanity nor feel guilty for keeping all their advanced technology for themselves while humanity struggled through miserable periods in human story such as the dark and middle ages. Their plan was to flood the world while evacuating everyone beforehand and then putting all those 7 billion people back to Earth without their technology, presumably to starve and die. Doraemon and his friends barely stop them, and they promise at the end of the film to do better and work harder at protecting nature while the cloud people leave for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantAliens">Plant Alien</a> planet.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em>, the Emperor and nobles of the Vers Empire on Mars act as if they represent some kind of ancient noble bloodline and regard the Terrans of Earth with disdain. It should be noted, however, that Vers is just an Earth colony that decided to revolt upon finding some ancient technology, the eponymous Aldnoah, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. While the Aldnoah is a rather decisive advantage, it's literally the only thing Vers has over Earth, as Mars has no natural resources.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>: While she isn't a jerk about it, Klan Klan is extremely proud of her Zentraedi heritage and frequently makes comments about Zentraedi weapons being superior to human-designed ones.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comicbooks </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a></em> often compares modern-day Earth to ancient Zenn-La. WHAT IF #41 is a good example.
</li><li> According to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> comics, Earth is considered a primitive backwater planet by most other species in the DC universe. Indeed, Abin Sur's last words as he handed his ring over to Hal Jordan were, "Heh. An Earthman. Never thought I'd live to..."
</li><li> You probably could swing a stick and find a group that did this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>. It's one of the main reasons Robotnik/Eggman had total control.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans">The Inhumans</a> often look down on humanity for being primitive because their society had advanced technology (imported from the same aliens that uplifted them) while the rest of humanity were hunter gatherers. Also they're a society of superhumans. In the Ultimate continuity, this was so bad that they move to Moon because the Fantastic Four visited their settlement and breathed the same air as them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>:</em> King J-Son of Spartax (or Spartoi) spends a lot of his time going on about how humans are dumb and stupid and ugly and etc. His son is half-human. Actually gets to a point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Infinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Infinity">Infinity</a></em> when J-Son starts getting angry about humans being brought into a war planning session, telling them they'll only be useful if they need cannon fodder. The Supreme Intelligence pipes up by comparing Earth's success rate against the Kree Empire to that of Spartax. Humanity's success rate is <em>much</em> higher - essentially as close as the Supreme Intelligence gets to "dude, just shut up."

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MythosEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MythosEffect">Mythos Effect</a></em>, the Turians exemplify this, especially as they look down on the NEF's use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>, which they consider Sufficiently Advanced tech, probably prothean, which the idiot monkeys found and rationalized as magic. Sparatus in particular, when meeting with the NEF military, refuses to use their actual titles, and insists on calling everyone "human".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ADiplomaticVisit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ADiplomaticVisit">A Diplomatic Visit</a></em>: A number of ponies act as if their society is better than any from non-ponies, and as shown in Slice n' Dice's story, some go out of their way to deliberately act against the wolves' culture and disrespect it.

<ul><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> movie: "Why are we fighting to save the humans, they're a primitive and violent race". This coming from the race of giant robots with weapons built into their bodies who have been engaged in a millennia-long war. Optimus Prime, however, does point out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">"Were we so different?"</a>
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFavoriteMartian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFavoriteMartian">My Favorite Martian</a></em> movie, where Martin starts complaining about his spaceship's "electron accelerator" getting fried and then tells Tim "I'd tell you what it is, but you think E = mc<sup>2</sup>". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It then turns out that an "electron accelerator" is just flowery <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">Technobabble</a> for an alternator taken from Tim's sedan.</span>
</li><li> Subverted in the cinematic adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>. With the life of the last woman in the galaxy hanging in the balance and a monstrous bureaucracy keeping the heroes from rescuing her, Arthur Dent takes a deep breath and announces, "I'm British, I know how to queue." And then he quickly gives up after seeing that waiting in line is going to take too long.
</li><li> Naturally, the Psychlos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattlefieldEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattlefieldEarth">Battlefield Earth</a></em> won't shut up about how much better they are than "man-animals" and mock them at every possible opportunity. Of course, when the "man animals" decide to fight back it's a truly epic fail for the Psychlos.
<div class="indent"><strong>Terl:</strong> While you were still learning how to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">spell your name...</a> <em>I</em> was being trained... to <em>conquer galaxies!</em>
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHammer">The Hammer</a></em>: When Nicaraguan-American Oswaldo and his family tout the superiority of Nicaraguan athletics, his friend Jerry pointedly notes that they seem to love talking about Nicaragua except for the part where they risked their lives to not have to live there anymore.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>: Quite a few times, the various alien races and humans that interact end up doing this to each other.
<ul><li> Andalites, being a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVulcan">Straw Vulcans</a>, do this frequently. Ax makes no secret of his intellectual superiority over humans, Elfangor and Arbron are befuddled by how humans are even capable of walking, and any given Andalite military commander that the Animorphs encounter is guaranteed to be arrogant and dismissive of non-Andalites. The Animorphs vary between finding this amusing (such as when Ax fails to hide that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> slacker by Andalite standards), or frustrating.
</li><li> #10 did this with the Pemalites vs. the Andalites, where Erik tells the Animorphs that Pemalites had FTL travel long before Andalites discovered fire, annoying Ax. Funnily enough, "The Ellimist Chronicles" later revealed that the Pemalites didn't even exist when the Andalites were living in tribal societies.
</li><li> #26 did this with the Howlers, but it was pointed out that a head start in years didn't necessarily make them smarter.
</li></ul></li><li> The fairies regularly boast of their superiority over the "mudmen" (i.e. humans). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> series. Their technology is more advanced, their society is less harmful to the environment, their nature is less violent, etc. Artemis himself didn't bother to humor them as he outsmarted them in the first book, and some of their number can be as ruthless as any human.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ImpracticalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ImpracticalMagic">Impractical Magic</a></em>: Yam is the victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> and as such overcompensates by being too proud of the Len's concept of a 'Virtue'. He frequently dismisses humans as being unaware bigots while referring to them as uncultured savages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNarrator">The Narrator</a> does it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mort" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mort">Mort</a></em>, although his definition of cultural superiority makes it clear it's a parody: Klatch "had 15 words for assassination before the rest of the world had caught on to the idea of hitting each other with rocks".
</li><li> An understated example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lord Rust</strong>: That's a Make-Things-Bigger Device isn't it? My word, you're up to date; they were only invented last year! <br/><strong>Klatchian general</strong>: I didn't buy this. I inherited it from my grandfather.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em>, in the country of Djelibeybi (heavily based on Ancient Egypt), the High Priest reminds the king that "your family was on its third dynasty before our neighbors had worked out, sire, how babies are made."
</li><li> Ankh-Morpork also has a tendency to cultural posturing, but usually of a pointedly understated kind. As one upper-class soldier puts it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatch">Night Watch</a></em>, other countries have to keep telling everyone they're the best; Morporkians just <em>know</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreambloodDuology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreambloodDuology">Dreamblood Duology</a></em>, Kisuati are quick to remind the Gujaareen that Gujaareh is a daughter-state of Kisua that's become corrupted in the eyes of the Kisuati.

Regarding Earth, the traditionalists' position is that they had starflight while Terrans were still living in caves and digging up grubs and 'Larsaf III' is just a lost colony anyway (Atlantis <em>was</em> in fact one of their settlements thousands of years ago, although the natives were already in place). They don't let the historical fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arkon itself turns out to be merely a colony <em>of</em> a colony dating back to Earth's first interstellar empire that was devastated by war some 50,000 years ago</span> get in their way in the slightest, of course.

Whereas the southern peoples of Westeros are beholden to their liege lords and have to follow silly things like "laws", the "free folk" as the wildlings call themselves have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> philosophy. That said, despite how cocky the wildlings are the southern peoples are <em>far</em> better than they are in every other respect (the wildlings' "free" way of life makes all of their factions prone to infighting to the point that the Night's Watch was confident that killing Mance Rayder would cause his massive army to disintegrate, not to mention the south has better armor, horses, weapons, and pretty much everything else), despite the wildlings thinking that once they get past the Wall they'll be able to run roughshod over everyone.
<ul><li> In the south, a mixture of this and House Posturing prevails. Northerners think Southerners are pampered and weak, Southerners think Northerners are crude and savage, the ironborn look down on everyone who doesn't pillage and burn for a living (bonus demerits for being literate, and especially maesters, who are well-read <em>for a living</em>), and <em>everyone</em> thinks Dorne is a bit weird <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">because of that whole "women being equal" thing</a>. That's just the posturing based on geography; the pissing matches between individual Houses can be <em>brutal</em>, even when they don't extend to actually drawing swords.

</li><li> One short story from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Tortall Universe</a></em> is about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrickstersDuet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TrickstersDuet">Nawat</a> and Aly's experience as new parents. Nawat insists on raising the babies (who did come out as babies and not chicks) the crow way; he rants about how stupid diapers are and how much better it is that chicks defecate outside the nest. Accordingly, he sneaks the triplets to the window whenever he gets a chance, which causes a diplomatic incident when the mess hits an ambassador's secretary. After yelling at him for holding babies out of the <em>two-story window</em>, it takes Aly about five minutes to come up with a compromise.

It gets even better in the follow-up <em>Colonization</em> series when the Colonization Fleet arrives to find that the Conquest Fleet has failed to conquer the entire planet. Their general attitude is that an inferior race like the Tosevites has no business being at least as advanced (or more advanced in some areas) than the Race. After all, Tosevites have been fighting with swords on horseback a mere 800 years (400 Tosevite years) ago, while the Race has deliberately kept their culture and technology unchanged for 50,000 years, as well as an unbroken line of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God Emperors</a>.

<ul><li> Whenever the Time Lords appear (in the classic series, at least), they generally have this kind of attitude to non-Time Lords; in one story, a Time Lord dismisses 160th-century Earth technology as the kind of thing his people had mastered "when the Universe was less than half its present size". It's gradually but persistently undercut, however, by increasing revelations that they're stagnant and over-sheltered as a civilization, incompetent at anything that falls outside their protected little bubble, corrupt and hypocritical, and altogether not nearly as high-and-mighty as they'd like others to believe.
</li><li> The Doctor himself occasionally displays this kind of attitude but is equally quick to point out the faults of his own kind and sing the praises of other cultures that impress him (especially humanity). Though in the pilot episode, when William Hartnell's Doctor was considerably ruder and snarkier, he claimed to Ian that before human beings turned the first wheel, the people of his world had reduced free movements through the farthest reaches of space 'to a game for children'. Even if some of the things he praises them for are rather trivial (Jelly Babies and Edible Ball Bearings), but he's a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Loon</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> As was the case in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">the books</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> is thick with people posturing cultures. It <em>really</em> stands out in the History and Lore of Westeros animation extras that accompany the boxed disc sets of each season—these segments are narrated by one (or several) characters. Many of them, when speaking of their homeland (by birth or by ancestry), are quick to brag about its martial prowess, its great achievements, or its social progressiveness—often coupled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">a snarky putdown</a> of other cultures found in the series.
<ul><li> As noted in the Literature section above, the Wildlings love posturing—both Ygritte and Tormund Giantsbane do this in their respective segments.
</li><li> Oberyn Martell, in a Season 4 History and Lore segment on his house, says of Dorne's long tradition of equal respect and fealty to nobility of both sexes: "For unlike the rest of Westeros, <em>our</em> loyalty <em>isn't</em> commanded by a cock."

<ul><li> The Nox are a non-human race of pacifists who live a simple life because they are so technologically advanced that they can afford to be neutral pacifists who don't need to fight the Goa'uld; the Goa'uld are simply no threat to them and they can also cloak entire cities from detection and heal the recently dead. They call the humans of Earth 'children' and constantly refer to Earth humans doing things they disapprove of as 'children often do not do as they are told'. The condescending nature of this position does grate on the humans, but some of them also accept it as inevitable given the vast inequality in technological knowledge between the two species — mainly because the Nox given them no choice but to accept it.
</li><li> The Tollans refused to co-operate with the SGC because they viewed them as so primitive that the Tollans considered it a miracle they'd ever managed to get the Stargate working. Daniel calls them out on their rudeness by comparing their condescension with that of the Nox, commenting that the Nox at least had the manners to refer to the humans of Earth as 'children' instead of 'primitives'. He ends up introducing the Tollans and the Nox to each other in order to protect the Tollans from Earth politics. While it sets up a lasting alliance between Earth and Tollana, it inevitably creates such a one-sided, condescending relationship that Earth has to practically bully Tollana into defending itself when the Goa'uld threatens the existence of Tollana. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By that point, it's too late, and Tollana is believed to have been completely wiped out by Anubis's subordinates.</span>
</li><li> Samantha's father (during his stint of being possessed by a Tok'Ra) told her that Earth humanity was an inexperienced race. It wasn't meant to be derisive, but a simple statement of fact, as Earth had barely begun fighting the Goa'uld a couple of years ago, while the Tok'Ra had been doing so for centuries (with a conspicuous lack of progress).
</li><li> Subverted by the Asgard who will openly admit that they're more advanced (that's rather self-evident), but they aren't arrogant or condescending about it. They respect humanity for the achievements they've made and see a potential for greatness in humans. They are also able to admit when they need humanity's help; Thor half-jokingly refers to them needing a human's "dumb ideas" to reach conclusions and solutions that the Asgard cannot on their own.
</li><li> The Goa'uld have also lapsed into this at times, whenever they feel the need to brag, such as Zipacna at the Tollan trial, who points out that Goa'uld have had advanced tech for thousands of years while humanity has barely landed on their Moon. Daniel tries to take the wind out of his sails by pointing out that the Goa'uld <em>stole</em> that technology from the Ancients rather than innovate it themselves. Zipacna doesn't see why that should matter: the point is they got the tech, and humanity did not.

The Eldar are particularly guilty of this. It's made all the more stupid on their part because humanity didn't <em>destroy their own civilization via a galaxy-wide orgy that birthed a god that feeds on souls.</em> They also refuse to believe that they could be in the wrong at any point or that someone else might have a good plan for stopping something (they once tried to destroy an entire planet in an effort to safeguard a long-buried craft world from the Tyranids and apparently refused to believe that the Blood Ravens could fight it off). This is best illustrated (along with an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">Shut Up, Hannibal!</a>) in this quote:
<div class="indent"><strong>Farseer Mirehn Bielann</strong>: The stars themselves once lived and died at our command, yet you still dare to oppose our will.

Repeatedly. At every conceivable opportunity. Sometimes he would just spout patronizing things about other cultures entirely at random.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Javik</strong>: Did you know that the salarians used to lick their eyes?
</div><ul><li> He even manages to do this when he's <em>praising</em> you. When you talk with him on the Citadel, he's approached by several aliens who overhear you mention that he's Prothean (among these is a very religious hanar, who worship the Protheans). After he gives them a pep talk, Shepard can reply to the audience asking what he's like by saying he's a good ally to have around. Javik's response:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Javik</strong>: The Commander is a capable warrior as well. For a Human. Who used to live in caves.

<div class="indent"> <strong>Shepard</strong>: We will <em>fight!</em> We will <em>sacrifice!</em> And we <em>find a way!</em> That is what Humans <em>do!</em>
</div></li><li> The Turians, particularly in the first game have shades of this towards Humanity, due to residual animosity left over from the First Contact War. The scary thing is that their assessment that both sides could wipe out the other is <em>right</em>. Mordin states in the second game that the Salarian Government did hypothetical projections of what would happen if the Turians and the Humans ever ended up fighting a prolonged war and the best scenario ended with both races likely wiping themselves out, but not before both sides had practically <em>destroyed</em> a quarter of the <strong>Galaxy</strong> first!
</li><li> All the Council races do this, in a constant cycle of posturing at each other. The Asari remind everyone that they're so diplomatic and wise, the Salarians want you to know that they're the smartest and the cleverest, the Turians have to point out that they can wipe the floor with everyone else in a straight-up fight, and then the Humans butt in to say they're almost as good diplomats as the Asari, almost as smart as the Salarians, nearly as tough as the Turians, and they've only been doing this for 50 years, so <em>there</em>.
</li><li> And <em>then</em> there are the krogan. Krogan bluster mostly comes in two forms: "we are bigger and tougher than you and that is why we are better" and, as a subset of the first, "none of you would survive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Tuchanka</a> for more than ten seconds". Thankfully, Wrex has grown very disillusioned with his people over the past thousand years or so, and Grunt was mostly "raised" on glorious legends and videos of old battles with no actual emotional connection and responds to his first sight of Tuchanka with a wordier version of "what a shithole", so you're mostly spared this from your teammates.
</li><li> Of course, the whole point is a thoroughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed Trope</a> by some characters who are painfully aware of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">Cultural Posturing</a> of their own race - namely, Matriarch Aethyta for the Asari, and either Wrex or Eve for the Krogan. Garrus also seems highly conscious of Turian flaws, especially in the second and third games after he's become more disillusioned and cynical. He even apologizes to Tali at one point for the little bit of posturing he did toward her in the first game. Kaidan has a moment of this toward humanity, arguing that people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador">Udina</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">not helping their people's case</a>.

</li><li> The Reapers almost seem to enjoy this. They constantly remind Shepard how superior they are to everything else in the galaxy, how all life is just their experiment and their plaything, how everything else in the Milky Way is completely at their mercy and can be terminated whenever they wish it.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Altmer (High Elves)</a> take the cake as the haughtiest culture in Tamriel. They are a tall, golden-skinned race of Mer with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">exceptional natural aptitude for magic</a> and are responsible for much of Tamriel's art, science, philosophy, language, and religion, fitting squarely within the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">Crystal Spires and Togas</a> as a race. They are the direct descendants of the Aldmer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> to all modern races of Mer) and consider the other races of Mer as a result of "degeneration" over the ages. (And don't even bother trying to bring up the races of Men...) Their religious beliefs state that they are the true descendants of the Aedra ("Our Ancestors" in old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">Aldmeris</a>), the deities who aided in the creation of the mortal world, known as Mundus. They believe the creation of Mundus was a cruel trick on the part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">dead creator god</a>, Lorkhan, which robbed their divine ancestors of their pre-creation divinity, forcing them to experience mortal suffering, loss, and death. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">while there are exceptions</a>, most Altmer are proud to bring up any of the aforementioned facts whenever they get the chance. Their culture did suffer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a> moment in the late 2nd Era, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Tiber Septim</a> used the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Dwemer</a>-constructed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Numidium</a> to deal the Altmer a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> defeat in which their capital city was sacked in less than an hour, forcing them to join an Empire of Men by conquest for the first time in their history. When the Septim Dynasty ended at the start of the 4th Era, the Altmer rose once again under the leadership of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">extremist Thalmor</a>, reforming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a> of old.
</li><li> The Dunmer (Dark Elves) were not far behind their Altmer cousins in terms of haughtiness at their cultural height. They were an extremely xenophobic race who hated outlanders within their homeland of Morrowind, but had no issue with raiding Black Marsh or Elsweyr to take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonian</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFolk">Khajiiti</a> slaves. The Tribunal Temple, which by the 3rd Era had become a shining example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a> full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knights Templar</a> who followed their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> (the Tribunal) to a fault. Hypocrisy was rampant in their culture where, for instance, they would sic their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchPolice">Church Police</a> on anyone accused of practicing necromancy with orders to kill on sight, while the Dunmer themselves would summon the bodies and spirits of their ancestors for protection, considering it a "holy act" when they do it. However, the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion Crisis</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Red</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano">Year</a>, and finally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">Argonian Invasion</a> were a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a> series of events for the Dunmer. Their homeland was choked with volcanic ash and the still-habitable parts were under the control of their long-time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a>, forcing the Dunmer people to flee to the frozen, barren island of Solstheim and to Skyrim, where they are treated as second-class citizens (at best) by the native, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Elf-hating</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>.
</li><li> The Imperials of Cyrodiil have displayed this whenever they have been leading their various empires that have spanned most or all of Tamriel. As they conquer new lands, they have traditionally enforced their rather liberal Imperial values, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">a heavy focus on mercantilism and trade</a> as well as significant religious tolerance, believing them to be superior to the "barbaric" cultures they are replacing and leading to plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">Culture Clash</a>. (Given that a lot of the cultures they have replaced were rife with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racism</a>, classism, and every other negative "-ism" you can think of, they weren't entirely un<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">justified</a> in this belief.) Following the fall of the Septim Dynasty's Third Empire, as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, this is happening quite a bit toward the Nords. The Imperials love to point out how their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGloryThatWasRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGloryThatWasRome">glorious cosmopolitan empire</a> is superior to the barbaric, frozen wilderness of Skyrim. Note that this isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> because it's the Nord culture that is looked down upon, not the actual Nord race, though you'd be forgiven for pointing out that this is a distinction without a difference. Best summed up by General Tullius, the military governor in charge of bringing Skyrim back under Imperial control;
<div class="indent"> <strong>General Tullius</strong>: If it wasn't for the Legion the provinces would descend to barbarity and anarchy, including Skyrim! <em>Especially</em> Skyrim!
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfTheApocalypse">Alduin</a> and most of the Dragons ("Dov") often seem to invoke this towards the Dragonborn. It's shown that they view the Dragonborn as their equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a>, repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating">berating</a> them for having the sheer audacity to take the name of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTheTranslatedForeignWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTheTranslatedForeignWord">Dovahkiin</a>" for themselves, despite the fact they are clearly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">not</a></em> a true member of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">Dragonkind</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> The Night Elves and Blood Elves of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> and the <em>Reign of Chaos</em> tend to have a high opinion of themselves and their role in the world. It's more obvious with the Blood Elves, while you need to look at the political actions of the Night Elves to see it.
<ul><li> To explain on the Night Elves: Their first reaction on seeing the orcs harvesting wood was not to warn them the woods were under their control; it was to launch an immediate attack. Once they learned of the Blood Elves, they sent covert teams into Quel'thalas to sabotage their magic. And when they wanted to bring up their concerns about potential Horde attacks on their villages, they did so by crashing a memorial for human soldiers.
<ul><li> Newer lore reveals, however, the Night Elves sought third parties that knew of the orcs (The Goblins) and informed themselves of their past, and the one who decided to launch the assault, was Cenarius. The covert teams into Quel'thalas were meant to spy on the Blood Elves for they suspected they were involved in Fel Magic (which they were).
</li></ul></li><li> It's worth pointing out that the Night Elves got a LOT less xenophobic in the transition from Warcraft III to World of Warcraft. This probably had a lot to do with them going from being their own faction in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/War3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/War3">War 3</a> to being part of the Alliance in WoW. Oddly, the same thing didn't happen with the Undead joining the Horde... at least, not right away. The newly added Shen'dralar Highborne elves, however, often play it straight.
</li></ul></li><li> Sir Roderick Ponce Von Fontlebottom The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em>. His exact culture is unknown, but he dresses like a Spaniard and talks like a Brit (not hard, considering he's voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCleese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCleese">John Cleese</a>) and seems to represent Western 17th-century imperialism in general. Of course, he doesn't just stop at posturing, he goes on right into trying to educate all ignorant foreigners of the Jade Empire to his way of thinking. Anyone who disagrees gets blasted with his musket, while Sir Roderick declares moral victory.
</li><li> This is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a> of the Kingdom of Rhodoks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MountAndBlade">Mount &amp; Blade</a></em> games; they consider themselves superior to the other nations of Calradia because they are the only nation to choose their king by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">Elective Monarchy</a>. As one of your followers points out, Rhodoks is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from the other kingdoms in spite of this; it still ends up with a king, a ruling class of lords, and a downtrodden peasant class.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>, most other nations in Thedas, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrenchJerk">Orlais</a>, consider Ferelden to be a barely-civilized backwater, populated by people only above their barbarian origins, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">stink of wet dog!</a> The typical Ferelden response is to become angry that their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesLoveDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesLoveDogs">dogs</a></em> were being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ITakeOffenceToThatLastOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ITakeOffenceToThatLastOne">insulted</a>!
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, Free Marchers tend to get in on this towards the Ferelden refugees in Kirkwall, displaced by the Blight.
</li><li> Jokingly invoked by a Snarky!Hawke, who decides to let a fellow Ferelden who's been caught stealing from their mine off the hook, by claiming to their Orlesian business partner that they were coerced into the theft, by someone who threatened their wife, children and killed their dog;
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Hawke</strong>: They even killed his dog to prove a point! His <em>dog</em>, Hubert! You know how important they are to Fereldans!
</div><ul><li> Most of the other races in Thedas are split into factions and none of them really get along.
<ul><li> Many of the Dalish look down upon city elves, who they see as abandoning their race and culture and assimilating with their human oppressors (even though they are treated as third-class citizens). City elves tend to think the Dalish are too proud and stuck in the past. Then there are the few <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ancient elves you encounter, who don't consider modern elves to be real elves at all, but tantamount to humans.</span>
</li><li> The dwarves of Orzammar aren't allowed to grace the surface without being exiled, to the extent of having their names and history erased from all records. Like city elves, "topsiders" are also seen as abandoning their culture, while many surface dwarves are exasperated by Orzammar's rigidly traditionalist culture that has led to the dwarves' dwindling numbers.
</li><li> Meanwhile, defectors of the Qun are not even technically Qunari anymore, and are seen by the latter as savages and treated like enemies much like every other non-Qunari race. Although not actually savages, many Tal-Vashoth do end up becoming bandits or mercenaries due to never learning how to survive outside the strictly structured Qun.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em> is actually able to <em>weaponize</em> cultural posturing: in the Civilization stage, Religious vehicles are able to convert an entire city by way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">gigantic hologram sermonizing the town into submission</a>, rather than bombing them into oblivion or literally buying them out completely. Once you reach the Space stage, nearly every single hostile NPC message (and about half of the neutral/friendly ones) are peppered with it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations">Galactic Civilizations</a></em>: It's possible to win just by being sufficiently smug about your culture and building a ton of broadcasters to convince their worlds that it is better. Of course, if you try this too blatantly on someone with a stronger military than you, there will be pain.
</li><li> The Cultural Victory in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> series of games essentially boils down to this. To win you need to produce more Culture per turn than your opponents, build more Wonders, acquire more Great Persons and Great Works, and (with Civ V's <em>Brave New World</em> DLC) use Tourism win over the populations of the other civs to your culture. There's some overlap with the Diplomatic Victory too, which is just winning the U.N. vote or winning the vote enough times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinTheNewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WolfensteinTheNewOrder">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a></em>: Extremely ironic example, when the Nazis lord themselves over the world due to their great leaps in unbelievably advanced science... which they stole from <em>Jewish scientists</em>, the Da'at Yichud. The crux of this irony is that the secret to the Da'at Yichud's success was due to the implementation of their culture in the scientific method (make strange things for the sake of understanding the universe and not material gain, store material possessions away from prying eyes, give technology to fellow men and receive it in return, etc.). The Nazis have effectively belittled and slaughtered an entire culture of absurdly-brilliant geniuses. When you think about it, cultural posturing throughout the ages has effectively <em>stunted</em> the potential of the average citizen, which was rejected by members of the Da'at Yichud and allowed them and their members to unlock humanity's full potential in secret.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>: One of the few things that make the generally benevolent Hoshido <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfGrey">grey</a> is their tendency to characterize all citizens of Nohr as wicked monsters when the truth is that it is really just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Garon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">his advisor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Iago</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">their chief general</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Hans</a>.

<ul><li> During a debate in the British Parliament, a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminDisraeli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BenjaminDisraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> was heckled with the cry of "Jew! Jew!". He replied, "My people were kings and princes, when yours were galley slaves." (For the record, he's giving a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoseTintedNarrative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoseTintedNarrative">Rose-Tinted Narrative</a> — the Kingdom of Judah also eventually became a Roman dominion.) In an open letter to the <em>Times</em> of London he remarked "Yes, I am a Jew and when the ancestors of the right honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine were priests in the temple of Solomon." Since he was talking specifically about the Irish with that quote: <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newgrange">Newgrange<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: circa 3200 BCE. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_Temple">Solomon's Temple<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: circa mid-900s BCE.
</li><li> American Senator Judah P. Benjamin made a similar observation on the Senate floor: "It is true that I am a Jew, and when my ancestors were receiving their Ten Commandments from the immediate Deity, amidst the thundering and lightnings of Mt. Sinai, the ancestors of my opponent were herding swine in the forests of Great Britain." Unfortunately, he was defending slavery at the time.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a> has Benjamin make a similar comment in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunsOfTheSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunsOfTheSouth">The Guns of the South</a></em> when, as Confederate Secretary of State, he's negotiating with his U.S. counterpart Ben Butler, who is not really a racist but uses anti-Semitic comments to try and rile Benjamin up. In this case, however, he rather more accurately refers to Hebrew civilization in contrast to <em>Germanic hunter-gatherers in Europe</em>, what with the Anglo-Saxons not having reached Britain at that point.
</li></ul></li><li> One common real-life version of this is referring to a foreign concept in relation to one's own culture (for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere">Molière</a>, Calderon, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPushkin">Alexander Pushkin</a> have been called the French, Spanish, and Russian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> respectively).
<ul><li> There's even a comment on this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash">Snow Crash</a></em> to the effect that while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> are called the Japanese Mafia, no one ever calls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> the Italian Yakuza (although some Japanese works <em>do</em> use "yakuza" as a catch-all term for organized crime).
</li><li> The 1989 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DolphLundgren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DolphLundgren">Dolph Lundgren</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePunisher1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePunisher1989">Punisher</a></em> movie puts a reversal on that. When the female yakuza boss addresses the room full of mafioso, she says "While your ancestors were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">screwing sheep</a> in the Mediterranean, mine were the crime lords of Asia." Which is inaccurate — both the yakuza and the mafia date to the early 17th century.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a> is a favorite source of Cultural Posturing among several different countries, usually among those from the Allies, and <em>especially</em> among the "Big Three" (United States, United Kingdom, Russia/Soviet Union). Many people from these countries don't want to share the credit for winning the war, even though it took all three Allies to beat the Axis. Russia and the United States would have been in big trouble if Britain hadn't held the line. Neither Britain nor Russia could have carried on without American logistical support and command of the Pacific front (which in turn would have been almost impossible without Australian aid, and so on, and so on). Without the Russians holding most of the Nazi attention on the Eastern Front, Britain and the United States would have had a <em>much</em> bloodier fight on their hands. It gets especially annoying when nobody in the argument is even old enough to have been around when the war happened let alone actually fought in it.
<ul><li> Whenever Americans and British people get into arguments, it often will involve the American claiming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaWonWorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaWonWorldWarII">"We bailed you out in World War Two!"</a>.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>, Ross's father does this while arguing with his fiancee Emily's parents.
</li><li> That argument was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> in a future episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>. When Moe tells Lisa's English fiance that they bailed them out in World War 2, he responds by reminding him that the English bailed the Americans out in World War 3. Moe admits that this is true.
</li><li> Exaggerated in another episode of <em>The Simpsons</em>, where the family goes to Britain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool">Homer</a> tries to shame a local telling him out of the blue that the Americans saved the Brits' ass <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">in Vietnam</a></em>.

"If it wasn't for us, you'd all be speaking <em>German!</em>". He says this <em>right after</em> claiming that Britain would be "the smallest fucking province in the Russian Empire."
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em>, Red says to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> Hyde: "Damn US Government?!

</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, British people will turn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaWonWorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaWonWorldWarII">America Won World War II</a> on its head by either claiming that it was Britain that shouldered the lion's share of the work while America stayed out of the war and reaped the benefits (in an equally offensive Britain Wins The War type argument) and/or claiming they owe more to the Russians than to the Americans.
<ul><li> In an episode of <em>Steptoe and Son</em> where 'arold and his father into a fight on a plane; when an American tries to stop it/join in, dad pushes him away with a contemptuous "Late again!"
</li><li> To quote the English comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieIzzard">Eddie Izzard</a>: The Americans were apparently watching old cavalry movies because they came to the rescue in the nick of time. "Dun Dun Dun DUH! HERE COMES AMERICA! AHHH I Love the smell of Europe in the morning! Now, what's for brunch?" "WHAT? Where have you been! We're bloody knackered!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChickenRun">Chicken Run</a></em>, Fowler complains that Americans are "always showing up late for every war." At another point, he calls them "overpaid, oversexed, and over here", which was a derogatory phrase in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>-era Australia.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotTheNineOClockNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotTheNineOClockNews">Not the Nine O'Clock News</a> had a comment on the bellicose nature of the US under Reagan as "trying to make up for being late to the last two world wars by being really punctual this time".
</li></ul></li><li> Russians also have their own form of The Soviet Union Wins The War, arguing that since the Nazis suffered 80% of their losses on the Eastern Front (fighting with armies of no less than three million men at all times for a total turnover of 8 million Soviet and 4 Million German soldiers dead, whereas Britain and the USA fielded a couple of million men with losses of less than a million put together) as well as being the only ones present at the Battles of Stalingrad, Kursk, and Berlin (the biggest of the war), the Russians won the war all by themselves. Never mind the effect of Anglo-American lend-lease aid (which accounted for as much as 25% of all Soviet war-time production and staved off a Soviet famine), that in mid-1943 the Luftwaffe mysteriously vanished, that more than a third of the German army was preoccupied with the Anglo-Americans at all times, etc. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Also, the Soviet Union did not at all collaborate with the Nazis for their own territorial aggrandizement and absolutely did not end up fighting them due to a falling out among thieves, how dare you even suggest that</a>. It might not be easily noticeable in the Anglosphere, compared to American and British attitudes, but it can and will pop up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism">anywhere World War II is discussed</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheeseEatingSurrenderMonkeys">Cheese-Eating Surrender Monkeys</a> is this trope inverted and directed towards the French. Never mind all their military accomplishments up to that point, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">Napoleon.</a></em> The fact that Germany absolutely crushed them during WWII essentially cemented their poor military reputation. The fact that the Germans crushed the British and other Allies too is conveniently forgotten.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a> can often cause the same kind of posturing as World War II. Considering how often alliances changed, the sides are less clear-cut, but to this day which nation deserves the lion's share of the credit for beating Napoleon will usually depend on what language the history is being written in. The British are proud of opposing him for twenty solid years and racking up huge naval victories, the Russians are proud of crushing the Grand Armee during Napoleon's invasion, and the Germans/Austrians can boast some of the only field victories over the man himself.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a>, propaganda efforts took this tack occasionally. For example, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.psywarrior.com/JapblackltrpropC.jpg">the Japanese leaflet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> from <a class="urllink" href="http://www.psywarrior.com/JapanPSYOPWW2.html">this collection<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> says in English: <em>"Our history is ten times older than yours. While your ancestors were roaming around as savages, Japan was already civilized. We are civilized much more than you Americans."</em>
</li><li> Strangely for all his racist arrogance and claims of superiority, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> actually <em>inverted</em> this on the Germans when drawing comparisons with the Italians. He was annoyed that his lackey Himmler tried to dig up Germanic tribal artifacts from archaeological sites, and mocked him by stating that the Romans were already highly civilized when the Germans were still living in huts.
</li><li> It's somewhat rare for the American Revolution to be brought up as an instance of American Cultural Posturing. Whenever it is, it's almost <strong>always</strong> followed up by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> reminding everyone that the Americans had help from the French. Sometimes this even gets turned into French Cultural Posturing instead, suggesting that France carried all the burden of freeing the Thirteen Colonies, even though the French needed the Americans to carry some of their own objectives. Lafayette <em>was</em> leading an army of Americans, after all—and when the English tried to pass over Washington and surrender to Rochambeau, he called them on it.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em> is one of the rare examples of this: After trying (and failing) to get the support of Lord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssInAmbassador">John Marbury</a>, the new British Ambassador to the United States, to support a new missile shield defense system that Leo is supporting, Leo takes him aside at a dinner party pretty much for the sole reason of snottily reminding him who kicked whose ass at the Battle of Yorktown in the American War of Independence.
<ul><li> In another episode, the same two characters memorably avert this, when Marbury concisely defines the "original sins" of their two nations: Ireland (UK) and slavery (US).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Related to this, both the British and the Americans always insist that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">The American Revolution</a> was the "good revolution" while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> was the "bad" one that led to mob rule, anarchy and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror">Reign of Terror</a> and later set an example for other brutal revolutions, chiefly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> did not endear herself to the public when she touted the "Glorious Revolution" during France's bicentennial (where she was a guest). The fact that contemporary democratic ideals (anti-racism, religious tolerance, popular suffrage, people's right to protest) resemble the French example more than the American and English ones gets lost in this simple win/lose vision of history, which presumes an unbroken continuity that brushes away the great deal of civil strife, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a>, and oppression of minorities that happened in America and England as it did in France, as well as the nasty treatment of British Loyalists that occurred in a newly-independent US that saw them as traitors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">collaborators</a>; many Canadians trace their heritage to Loyalists who fled the country when their property was seized without compensation.
</li><li> Canadians, on the other hand, are always quick to brag about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>, treating it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> in Canada's favor—as exemplified in claims that Canadian forces "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WashingtonDCInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WashingtonDCInvasion">burned down the U.S. capital</a>." That was actually the work of British Army regulars who'd just arrived from Europe, and it was also in retaliation for (among other things) American forces burning down <em>Canada's</em> own capital of York (known today as Toronto).
<ul><li> Broader examples involving the War of 1812 are the assertions among Canadians, British, and Americans that their people were the ones who won the war. In reality, the war was more or less inconclusive ("status quo ante bellum"); none of the sides involved got what they <em>really</em> wanted (though you will certainly find arguments over which side achieved its war aims), and in fact holding the line and not giving up territory to their enemy has become a point of pride for <em><strong>both</strong></em> the Americans and Canadians (paradoxically), as well as being an establishing moment of cultural identity for both Americans and (English) Canadians (again, paradoxically).
<ul><li> Example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth">Due South</a></em> Fraser mentions it to a class of schoolkids. "your country invaded our country and we sent you packing".
</li></ul></li><li> Britons are more likely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">have little recollection that the War of 1812 even happened</a> (or pretend to be unaware of it in order to troll Americans) since they were also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">doing more important things at the time</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Modern-day Arabs <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4b902');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4b902" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4b902');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> And other Muslims, except for Iranis (see below) </span> often pull this on Westerners. You'll commonly hear that Muslim nations gave more rights to women and the condemned than Western countries and that there were long stretches of history where Muslim countries were more scientifically advanced than Western nations. There was certainly quite a lot of valuable research done by Arab scholars like Ibn al-Haitham and Jabir ibn Hayyan, and it's true that both trading with and warring against the Arabs really helped spur the European Renaissance<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note59foe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note59foe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note59foe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Believe it or not, one of the things coveted by Europeans during the Crusades were copies of Greek and Latin scientific texts!</span>—however, this sort of posturing ignores the fact that Europe's Dark Ages were not <em>nearly</em> as dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalMorons">as they are commonly depicted</a>.
<ul><li> Sometimes you'll see a riposte from Westerners who counter scientific sophistication with social progressiveness—for example, claims that Islam has always allowed men sexual rights to their slaves, while both Christianity and Judaism <em>never</em> have (apart from the American South). Those who know about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory">late 20th to early 21st century discoveries regarding medieval European society</a> like to point out that French and Germanic medieval societies had a long history of egalitarianism dating back to their pagan roots. For example, you'll hear that 12th-century Frenchwomen owned property, practiced trades, filed lawsuits, and <em>voted</em> in any assembly where men could. 12th-century Turkish, Arab, or even Byzantine women ... not so much. And they might follow it up by pointing out that in some respects, modern Arab societies are <em>less</em> socially progressive in the 21st century than they were in the 12th.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran">Iranians</a> pull this a lot on Arabs, citing the ancient Persian civilization (going back to Cyrus) compared to the comparatively recent Arab one. Ironically, the Achaemenid Empire used Aramaic as the language of the court, which is a Semitic language close to Arabic. In fact, Persians were always influenced to great degrees by their Semitic-speaking neighbors, and this didn't simply start with Arabs (of course the reverse is also true to a degree).
</li><li> Get a bunch of Americans from different states together and there will inevitably be some state-pride based posturing.
<ul><li> A popular joke between neighboring states is "If you took the northern/southern/eastern/western counties of State A and transferred them to State B, both states' average IQ would go up."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> did it on behalf of the Chinese when he observed "These people were already writing books when we were still forest-dwellers."
</li><li> The British once ruled the largest empire ever, and have never let anyone forget it. Ever. Especially Americans, usually along the lines of "You're just a jumped-up colony that we used to own." Today, the majority of the land in the modern-day United States was never under British rule.
</li><li> An old joke features three people having an argument on which of their cultures is the superior one. The first is traditionally an American, who gives a list of all of America's achievements. The second is German, and he does the same. The third is Chinese, with this guy proceeding to list all of the things the Chinese achieved while Western culture was in its infancy. The American replies, "But what have you guys done lately?" As time passed, it got a secondary punchline to the tune of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChinaTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChinaTakesOverTheWorld">Well... own you?</a>"
</li><li> Some descendants of Irish immigrants from the days of colonization of the United States joke about being immortal. This is because Ireland is geographically in the same place as Atlantis is in the non-Irish Atlantis stories, but aside from that the assertion doesn't have any real basis aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhenotypeStereotype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhenotypeStereotype">the red hair not graying as fast</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi's</a> famous comment on Western Christian civilization: "I think it would be a very good idea."
</li><li> Conspiracy theorist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisEDec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisEDec">Francis E. Dec</a> claimed that the Slovenic-Polish population were the most ingenious race and the creators of all science and religion. The fact that he was of Polish-American heritage <em>might</em> have had something to do with it...
</li><li> Israeli Jews pull this a lot on their Arab neighbors, who do the same to Israel. Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabIsraeliConflict">given the state of affairs between them</a>, it's not surprising. This plays out very much like the Western world (where Israel is a convenient proxy for the West, being more culturally Western than Middle Eastern, or Asian for that matter) vs. the Arab world mentioned above: Israelis and their supporters see themselves as a bastion of civilization in a barbaric Middle East, while the Arab world accuses Israel of stealing everything culturally distinctive from them.
</li><li> Georges Clemenceau once said: "England, that French colony that went wrong." (<em>Angleterre, cette colonie française qui a mal tourné.</em>)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note68l6c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note68l6c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note68l6c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> For those wishing to deny the Frenchness of the Norman invaders it is worth recalling that a) they spoke French, b) technically the Duke of Normandy was a vassal of the King of France, c) the Normans actually descended from Danish and Norwegian invaders for the most part were also descended from indigenous French women, d) Normandy still is part of France (with the exception of the Channel Islands), and e) William's army also contained a sizeable Breton contingent, and Brittany also belongs to modern France.</span>
</li><li> Flemish people who know their history will point out that many of the artists and scientists who contributed to 'the Golden Century' which made The Netherlands a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Proud Merchant Race</a> were actually refugees from Antwerp and other cities caught in the crossfire between the (Spanish) Habsburgs and the Dutch, trying to escape the chaos of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEightyYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEightyYearsWar">'The Dutch Revolt'</a>.
</li><li> Some "Third Culture Kids" tend to display this attitude towards the communities and countries they live in, whether or not such arrogance is perceived or intentional. Compared to other examples, these tend to flaunt their constantly changing environments, travels, and more globally-minded worldview at the expense of the locals.
<ul><li> They often prefer the place they have moved to over their home country because they are better off due to work covering housing and expenses, the international schools they go to are full of people just like them (not judgemental), and, if they come from England, chances are the country they move to is bigger and has more of a sense of adventure to it. It is very rare for somebody to move to a country and prefer their home country unless they are a patriot.
</li><li> On a similar note, writer and world traveller <a class="urllink" href="http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-Ba20Spo-t1-body-d30.html">Pico Iyer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> noted the ironic tendencies of people like him to embrace this trope, just from another angle.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"We tell ourselves, self-servingly, that nationalism breeds monsters and choose to ignore the fact that internationalism breeds them too. Ours is the culpability not of the assassin, but of the bystander who takes a snapshot of the murder. Or, when the revolution catches fire, hops on the next plane out."
</div></li><li> Very common in Mexican culture (and sometimes, some Latin American ones) because the only better examples they have are the U.S. and Canada, and partly because American and Canadian laws, traditions and ethics are different from the Latin American ones.
<ul><li> In Mexico, sometimes this is raised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by Mexicans themselves, as besides U.S. and Canada, they also compare Mexico with <strong>Japan</strong>. In fact, for driving the point home, there's something in Mexico sometimes called <em>The American Newspaper Box Syndrome</em>, which is the explanation for why in Mexico there are no newspaper boxes in the streets, completely ignoring the fact that in the U.S. those newspaper boxes are also problematic, regarding the existing laws.
</li><li> This also happens in Spain, albeit to a less degree: a Spaniard newspaper criticized the Spaniard education system by comparing it with the one from Japan, describing the Spaniard college students having the same learning level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultToRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultToRocks">of Japanese junior high ones</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Filipinos are known to say "Pinoy Pride" or "Proud to be Filipino" whenever a Filipino (or someone with Filipino blood) earned international recognition, particularly when that person does well in entertainment industry (e.g. Charice, Jessica Sanchez) or wins a boxing match (e.g. Manny Pacquiao). <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/30091-matter-national-insecurity">Whenever someone criticizes anything about the Philippines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Filipinos would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">react</a> negatively to it. There is also a debate about whether "Pinoy Pride" is a strength to encourage Filipinos that they can do anything or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MisplacedNationalism">Misplaced Nationalism</a>.
</li><li> Often crops up between different German-speaking states and countries. Special mention should probably go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixteenLandsOfDeutschland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixteenLandsOfDeutschland">Bavaria</a>, whose fierce patriotism and pride is rather infamous. "Austrians? A bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic">imperialistic hillbillies</a> whose collective arses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">we kicked</a>. The Württembergians? Hippies and loudmouthed dullards, all of them! Prussians? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiserreich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiserreich">Arrogant militant bureaucratic pricks</a>. Saxons? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany">Communists</a>!"
</li><li> In the mid-1930s, the Austrian fascist movement actually was largely opposed to unification with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>. Not on the basis of any ideological opposition to Hitler's brutality and racism (they thought all of that was great), but purely because of cultural posturing. They believed that Austrians were "better Germans" and Austria was the "better Germany", and thus they'd be made less pure by uniting with Hitler's Germany.
</li><li> In some parts of Nigeria, it is actually considered patriotism to take part in the infamous 419Scam, where those who are successful in defrauding foreigners are treated like heroes and kings.
</li><li> Britain and Argentina tend to engage in this whenever the Falkland Islands are brought up. Also Britain and Spain over Gibraltar.
