A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope">Sub-Trope</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">Covers Always Lie</a> where a character who youd think was a main character does not get developed nearly as much as their counterparts. They're on all the advertisements, they get a witty one-liner in the trailer, but when the release date comes, they almost fade into the background. Basically, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> before the story even came out.
</p><p>This character is introduced at some pivotal point (usually the beginning) and then is generally ignored for the rest of the story. Maybe theyre seen for all of five minutes in a three-hour movie, or maybe they just lurk in the background while their friends do all the important stuff. Whatever the case, to qualify for this trope, a character must have been introduced in a way that implied he was going to be important, but is left out of most of the story.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>If the wasted character is in a series, the author may realize his mistake and give him some development in later episodes/books/etc. Alternatively, they can just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">put them on a bus</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">kill them off for real</a> to avoid having to deal with another character.
</p><p>Also may occur if an actor is in the opening credits but is seen in very little of the movie. Also could appear only in the cold opening and by the time their name appears in the opening credits they are not seen in the rest of the movie. This tends to be used with big named actors, and often in DVD re-releases of movies they appeared in before the big breakout role that made them stars. Might overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">One-Scene Wonder</a>. Also could be known as an Opening Credits Cameo.

Another possibility is that the extra is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Decoy Protagonist</a>. Some creators will even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">use this trope intentionally</a> to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Decoy Protagonist</a> twist more shocking. Many cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadStarWalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadStarWalking">Dead Star Walking</a> end up as this.

Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeGuestStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeGuestStar">Fake Guest Star</a>, where an actor is credited as a guest star but appears to be part of the main cast.

Some, like Cooler and Nappa, dont even appear despite being on the cover!

One of those was Majin Buu, who seemed like he would be able to get into action for once since he'd essentially been sidelined since the Battle of Gods Arc. He prepares for the tournament, getting a brand new form... then ends up dropping out due to falling asleep and ends up getting replaced by the <em>real</em> tenth member: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frieza</span>.

He was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Newtype</a>, a great pilot, and not only that, he was piloting a new Prototype Mobile Armor with remote weapons.

Heavily merchandised and loaded with weapons. It wreaks havoc across the colony for a few minutes, then gets torn to shreds in less than a minute by the Gundam Alex. Most likely the point of it's non-use; it was crashed early on, and in repairs up until the finale. <em>0080</em> wasn't about the Gundam battles itself, but knew that the build up for the final clash would make it more memorable.
</li><li> Descartes Shaman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">Awakening Of The Trailblazer</a></em>, who appeared on plenty of promotional material but ends up being a rather minor character.

The only major thing she does is split the final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket">Transformation Trinket</a> into two so that it can be used by both Ruru and Emiru, but even then its treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable</a></em>:

</li><li> Yukako Yamagishi is prominently featured in all three of the anime openings despite only appearing in a handful of episodes, a few of which only have her in brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cameo">Cameos</a> with minimal dialogue. Her part wasn't much bigger in the original manga, where she still managed to appear on quite a few chapter covers.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sai in the anime adaptation. While he's an important character during the arc he debuts in, his relevance to the plot and character development pretty much end there, and gets little to do afterwards. Yet lots of openings after his debut still featured him almost as prominently as Naruto and Sakura, despite both his screentime and contribution to the plot being minimal. He's much less featured in the openings (to the point of being absent in some of them) once the anime reached the Fourth Ninja War arc.
</li><li> In the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NarutoGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NarutoGaiden">Naruto Gaiden</a></em>, while Boruto was seen prominently in the promotional material for this spinoff, he has a rather small role whereas his classmate Sarada has become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extra</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NewGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NewGame">New Game!</a></em> the opening and ending credits act as if Aoba, Hifumi, Hajime and Yun are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGirlEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourGirlEnsemble">Four-Girl Ensemble</a>.

<ul><li> The main series tends to suffer this problem, with the main characters often obtaining monsters that end up receiving less screen time than the <em>guest stars</em>.
</li><li> Advertisements and trailers for various movies often prominently feature one or more Pokémon who ultimately play a very minor role, if any at all (it doesn't help that almost all of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">lie through their teeth</a>).

Agan is supposed to be one of the main six characters, but he tends to be just some guy who shows up every few episodes and says a few lines, maybe offers the team a ride (for a price, of course). It's never implied he's following the group or has any real interest in them; he just...appears. Of course, part of the problem could be that this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a> has removed his status as Morte's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Childhood Friend</a>, and a good deal of his development in the game comes from their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a> relationship. The other part could be that, since he never officially joins the team this time around, the writers just have to figure out a way to shoehorn him in somewhere.

In the actual movie her only significant scene is near beginning, when she assassinates a British politician under the influence of M. Bison's mind control. She is only seen briefly again halfway through the movie when one of M. Bison's monitor cyborgs records footage of her interrogation with Chun-Li and the only time she is ever mentioned after that scene is when M. Bison orders Sagat to eliminate her and Vega just before the final battle (but this assignment is never actually shown on-screen).
</li><li> Tigerstar in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> manga <em>Tigerstar and Sasha</em>, is this for the second and third books. In the first book, he was the love interest. However, in the second book (on which he is the only one on the cover), he shows up, asks the hero a question, and is never seen again! In book three, he only appears in dream sequences. It's like the writers didn't know what to do with him, so they hid him in a cupboard and hoped no one would find him.
</li><li> The end credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WastefulDaysOfHighSchoolGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WastefulDaysOfHighSchoolGirls">Wasteful Days of High School Girls</a></em> show Kohaku alongside all the other girls as if she's a main cast member, but she rarely interacts with them, and usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">only shows up as part of a pair with her more prominent sister Majo</a>.

He featured heavily in TV spots and on the website, and appears on the DVD cover (in place of Abby Mallard, who was a main character) yet has 3 lines of dialogue in the whole film ("Yo", "no", "whoa") and barely contributes to the story.

The movie was supposed to be used to promote several supermarket food brands, and as such, the cover had Mrs. Buttersworth, Twinkie the Kid, the Vlasic stork, Charlie the Tuna, etc. However, each of these characters were basically extras, only appearing in one or two scenes.
</li><li> Bobby from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie">A Goofy Movie</a></em> had a big enough role that it made sense for him to be advertised—or it would have if the trailers didn't play him up to the detriment of three secondary characters with bigger roles than his, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirNotAppearingInThisTrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirNotAppearingInThisTrailer">completely ousting one of them</a>. From viewing the trailer and looking at the cover art you would probably think Bobby was a main character on par with or barely beneath Goofy and Max. He actually has six scenes worth of screentime, one of which is spent doing nothing interesting or important and not being acknowledged, five of which are in the first act, and he completely disappears without even a mention for the entire second act and most of the third.

</li><li> Songbird Serenade in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyTheMovie2017">My Little Pony: The Movie (2017)</a></em> is featured front-and-center on displays at stores as if she is the protagonist, has her own plush toy, a large plastic doll, and a lot of other miscellaneous merchandise, but she appears only at the beginning, for one scene halfway through, and for the first credits song, with very little plot relevance. Undoubtedly this is to draw in fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia">Sia</a>, as she voices Songbird and is the basis for her design. Averted with the advertisement not related to the toys though, in which she is either in the background or absent entirely.

Likewise with Commander Cody who only has a few, mostly background appearances and three short lines in the entire film. Yet he appears on the main poster in a similar fashion to Captain Rex, in the background.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em>:
<ul><li> Michelangelo and Donatello in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TMNT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TMNT">TMNT</a></em>. All the posters, promotional material, and merchandise featured all four turtles evenly, but in the actual film they barely do anything and only appear in about a third of it in total.
</li><li> One of the first things revealed in the lead-up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TurtlesForever">Turtles Forever</a></em> was that the movie would feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">TMNT2003</a> versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesIITheSecretOfTheOoze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesIITheSecretOfTheOoze">movie villains</a> Tokka and Rahzar. <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/tmnt/images/b/be/Tmnt-forever-old-new-turtles-684x1024.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140415171926">The poster for the movie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> makes them one of its most notable elements, even more than several prominent characters. In the actual movie, they appear for less than a minute, unnamed, as part of a larger group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Droopy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Droopy">Droopy</a> was on the cover of and in many of the advertisements for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTheMovie">Tom and Jerry: The Movie</a></em>, even though he only gets a five second cameo.
</li><li> Gwen Stefani was advertised in many of the trailers for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trolls">Trolls</a>, her character DJ Suki, although she is present throughout the film has only two lines, though several of her songs are featured on the soundtrack.
</li><li> Piglet in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WinnieThePooh">Winnie-the-Pooh</a></em> short, <em>Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree</em>. He appears in the opening theme, but is absent from the actual short itself, and he would not properly show up until two years later in <em>Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day</em>.
</li><li> Every single cameo by a video game character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">Wreck-It Ralph</a></em>. The way that Disney marketed the film, it seems like they tried to make the cameos the stars and push the actual main characters to the background (but at least they have the honesty of putting at least one of the four protagonists along with the cameos in the posters). Like many animated films, there were even character-themed posters that a cameo character had all to themselves. These characters rarely appeared outside of the opening scene, and some of them didn't even have lines.
</li><li> Many of the supporting characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em> can fall under this, considering posters and other ads were littered with characters who had only a few (if no) lines and barely any screen time. Yax and Gazelle are particularly guilty of this but the worst offender is probably Flash, who was in only two scenes but had the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">teaser trailer centered around him</a> (in fact it's one of his two scenes <em>in its entirety</em>).

<ul><li> Any fans of B movies know that if the B movie heavily advertises a "name actor" being in the film, there is a high chance they are barely even in the movie.
</li><li> An increasingly popular trend is for blockbuster films to stunt cast well-known foreign actors in minor roles so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">they can heavily promote that aspect to overseas markets where those celebrities are more popular</a>.
<ul><li> A big example of this is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">Iron Man 3</a></em>. Wang Xueqi and Fan Bingbing have extremely minor roles (and in fact, Fan's scenes were not even included in the American release), but the overseas trailers depicted both actors alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonCheadle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonCheadle">Don Cheadle</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GwynethPaltrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GwynethPaltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> as though they were playing main characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">X-Men: Days of Future Past</a></em> cast popular French actor Omar Sy as Bishop, and popular Chinese actress Fan Bingbing (there she is again!) as Blink. The two heroes each got their own posters and were featured in the various trailers and TV spots. In the actual film, they only appear in a few scenes and have minimal dialogue. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">Blink at least gets a few cool action scenes</a>, though.
</li></ul></li><li> Rick Genest, aka "Zombie Boy", was featured prominently in <a class="urllink" href="http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/35100000/47-Ronin-Promotional-Poster-47-ronin-35151214-1579-2500.jpg">posters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortySevenRonin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortySevenRonin">47 Ronin</a></em>. He appears in one scene in the film that lasts about three minutes.
</li><li> Jeanette from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlvinAndTheChipmunks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlvinAndTheChipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">The Squeakquel</a></em>: The boys and her sisters all get ample screen time, whereas Jeanette seems to fall by the wayside. Older fans know her from the 1980s cartoon as a genius, but this never really comes out. She's never seen without her sisters, and she gets about 5 minutes of screentime that isn't singing. Fortunately, she gets significantly more screen time in the third movie. Dave as well actually has much more of a minor role than the film let on, as he's hospitalized for nearly all of it. The main human in the movie is actually a relative of his played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacharyLevi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZacharyLevi">Zachary Levi</a>.
</li><li> Despite being hyped up as a major supervillain in trailers and posters, Alexei "The Rhino" Sytsevich has around five minutes of screen-time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan2">The Amazing Spider-Man 2</a></em>, and we only see him as the Rhino for around <em>two</em> minutes. Alexei appears in exactly two scenes: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a> of the movie, and the final scene—where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the credits roll just as Spider-Man swings in to fight him</span>.
</li><li> A really weird backwards (though possibly deliberate) version happened with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelHeart">Angel Heart</a></em>. For anyone who hasn't seen the movie, it really does look like Robert De Niro's character is such. He's always billed as a "special appearance" even though the posters and DVD cover prominently shows him in front of the leads, making it appear that the film is just overbilling an actor who in actuality only has one scene. In the actual movie, while he doesn't have as much screentime as the lead, De Niro does make multiple appearances <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and his character turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> himself, suddenly making the cover in which he is prominently displayed make a disturbing amount of sense</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowersTheSpyWhoShaggedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowersTheSpyWhoShaggedMe">Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</a></em>: Elizabeth Hurley appears in the cold opening but is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelDeathSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenSequelDeathSyndrome">killed off</a> before we see her name in the opening credits.
</li><li> The advertising campaign for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em> heavily advertised the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GalGadot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GalGadot">Gal Gadot</a> would be making her debut as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> in the movie, and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonMomoa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonMomoa">Jason Momoa</a> would be making his debut as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a>. Though neither of them were actually pictured in the posters for the movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> widely distributed publicity photos of them in costume as their characters, released action figures of the two for the film's various toy lines, and prominently featured footage of Gadot in the final trailer. In the actual movie, however, Wonder Woman is a minor supporting character at best, and doesn't appear in costume until the climax of the movie; if the trailers and publicity photos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysSpoil">hadn't given it away</a>, moviegoers might actually have been <em>surprised</em> to learn that the mysterious European antiquities dealer was Wonder Woman all along. Aquaman is even worse: Jason Momoa never even appears in the flesh, and is only seen in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> some brief submarine footage in Lex Luthor's metahuman research archives</span>. Ironically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ezra Miller's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">the Flash</a> has actual dialogue and screen time, but he wasn't featured in advertisements and didn't get an action figure</span>.
<ul><li> After many fan and professional reviewers reacted to the film along the lines of "Wonder Woman's brief appearance is the only good thing about it", the British posters for the DVD and online release went so far as to feature Wonder Woman front and centre, with Superman and Batman behind her in "sidekick" position.
</li></ul></li><li> In a way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beetlejuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beetlejuice">Beetlejuice</a> kind of fits this trope, despite being the title character (sort of), and the main focus of all advertisements and promotional material is on screen no more than 17 minutes of the film's 92 minute run time. The film might as well have been called <em>The Maitlands</em> if it hadn't been for the fact that Beetlejuice stole the movie. Chances are the only scenes you remember are the scenes with him and the "Banana Boat Song" scene. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Beetlejuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Beetlejuice">The Broadway musical</a> attempts to redress this by re-writing the plot so Betelgeuse now appears almost immediately and has a much more consistent presence and relevance throughout the story.
</li><li> The cover for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Birdemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Birdemic">Birdemic</a> proclaims</em> "Hollywood legend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TippiHedren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TippiHedren">Tippi Hedren</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds">The Birds</a></em> co-stars."

</li><li> The 2010 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousHorror">Religious Horror</a> movie <em>Camp Hell</em> had a case of this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JesseEisenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JesseEisenberg">Jesse Eisenberg</a> that actually resulted in legal action. One of the movie's posters consisted almost entirely of his face and the title and he was highlighted in the trailer, but his character only appeared in a few flashback scenes. As a result, Eisenberg sued the distributor, Lionsgate Entertainment and Grindstone Entertainment, for fraudulent advertising.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">Robin Williams</a> became famous, he was given top billing in re-releases of his feature film debut <em>Can I Do It Till I Need Glasses?</em> which is a series of sketches involving sex jokes, Williams only appeared in two segments amounting to a minute of screen time.
</li><li> The beginning of <em>Celeste and Jesse Forever</em> imply the film is going to be evenly split between Celeste (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RashidaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RashidaJones">Rashida Jones</a>) and Jesse (Andy Samburg) but after ten minutes they stop hanging out together and the story sticks with Celeste; Jesse remains in the film on and off and he is important to the plot but he's definitely a supporting character in Celeste's story and gets far less screentime overall.
</li><li> Roux (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chocolat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chocolat">Chocolat</a></em> was advertised on all the posters, but actually doesn't appear until an hour into the movie and only has a minor role compared to the less advertised characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClashOfTheTitans2010" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClashOfTheTitans2010">Clash of the Titans</a></em> gave special focus to Danny Huston as Poseidon, Luke Evans as Apollo and Alexa Davalos as Andromeda. None of them gets more than about five minutes of screen time. In the latter two cases, the movie underwent extensive re-shoots and their characters ended up severely cut down. There was also considerable hype about some of the other Greek Gods, such as Hestia and Artemis. They would have had only a couple of lines in group scenes.
</li><li> In <em>Country Crush</em>, Jana Kramer receives top billing and takes up the majority of the cover while only being a supporting character while the actual main characters are reduced to the bottom third of the cover.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelMcCrea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoelMcCrea">Joel McCrea</a> receives top billing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CryBloodApache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CryBloodApache">Cry Blood, Apache</a></em>, but only appears for about 10 minutes in the segments that bookend the main story. And he interacts with no other character in the film.
</li><li> Ultra Violet receives top billing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CurseOfTheHeadlessHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CurseOfTheHeadlessHorseman">Curse of the Headless Horseman</a></em>'. She appears in one scene as a foreign noblewoman looking to buy the ranch: a scene that has no bearing on the plot.
</li><li> The official Netflix title card for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Da5Bloods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Da5Bloods">Da 5 Bloods</a></em> prominently features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChadwickBoseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChadwickBoseman">Chadwick Boseman</a>, likely due to the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther">Black Panther</a></em>. In the actual movie, he plays a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Character</a> who, while extremely important to the plot, only shows up in a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashbacks</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and as a ghost/hallucination near the end</span>.
</li><li> Luchino Visconti's <em>The Damned</em> gives Florinda Bolkan a featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring">and</a> credit in the opening credits. Bolkan's role amounts to a two minute, wordless cameo as Martin's escort in the wedding scene.

The advertisers were hoping to cash in on his popularity from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIII">Rocky III</a></em>, despite the fact that his character, aside from one memorable monologue in front of the Lincoln Memorial, has about as much screen time as most of the non-essential characters of the company (which, by the way, included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMaher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMaher">Bill Maher</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GaryBusey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GaryBusey">Gary Busey</a>).

Miranda's character isn't a protagonist in the movie.

Unfortunately, it was only featured in the actual film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead">for a few seconds before it crashed</a>, forcing our heroes to find another vehicle.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaRoberts">Emma Roberts</a> is one of the three actors to appear on the poster for the 2013 crime drama <em>Empire State</em>, even though she gets minimal screen time in the actual film. Strangely enough, Michael Angarano doesn't appear in <em>any</em> of the promotional material despite playing one of the main characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EuroTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EuroTrip">EuroTrip</a></em>: The Absinthe Fairy appears on every poster and advertisement, even though he only appears in two scenes of the finished film. Like Scrat, he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">fan favorite</a> since it's release.
</li><li> Jenna Jameson's appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvilBreedTheLegendOfSamhain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EvilBreedTheLegendOfSamhain">Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain</a></em> is hyped to the point of her receiving top billing.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSeagal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSeagal">Steven Seagal</a> received top billing on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExecutiveDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExecutiveDecision">Executive Decision</a></em> despite <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his character dying</span> before the cast even got on the plane.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables">The Expendables</a></em>. The two actors were featured on nearly every advertisement for the film but appear in only one scene. The trailers for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExpendables2">first sequel</a> showed that Arnie and Bruce were getting more screen time of the action variety, though they're still not the lead characters. For that matter, both Toll and Hale also have very minor roles despite having equal billing in the film. The only real members of the team to have any major roles are Barney, Lee, and to a lesser extent Yin.

While he is featured in a total of eight scenes (two are just voice overs), each appearance is brief and all he does is provide comic relief through his glaringly obvious commentary.

This is actually a complaint about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> in general - it treats Peeta/Katniss/Gale like a big triangle, but Gale barely appears in the first two books of the trilogy at all, thus making it fairly obvious who Katniss will end up with.

</li><li> The trailer to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Icebox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Icebox">Icebox</a></em> makes it seem like there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove">romance element</a> to the plot.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> movies have a few examples:
<ul><li> Paris Carver from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TomorrowNeverDies">Tomorrow Never Dies</a></em>. Her role was heavily promoted due to her being played by tv star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeriHatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TeriHatcher">Teri Hatcher</a>; she stands beside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleYeoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleYeoh">Michelle Yeoh</a> on the film poster, implying that they have equal importance. Her total screentime is about 15 minutes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The only important thing she does is tell Bond about the secret lab on the roof of Carver's printing facility in Hamburg. She is murdered offscreen for her troubles, her death marking the end of the first act</span>.
</li><li> Severine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em>, who appears in the movie just long enough to give her tragic backstory before sleeping with Bond and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> getting tied up and murdered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Silva</a> in front of an indifferent Bond just barely into the second act</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>, Lucia Sciarra, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonicaBellucci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MonicaBellucci">Monica Bellucci</a>, was lauded as being the oldest Bond Girl in the series and was expected to be a game-changer. Everything about that sentence is a lie. Not only is she not the film's leading Bond Girl, but she doesn't even qualify as the Secondary Girl, which this movie lacks. She gets exactly five minutes of screentime despite being promoted as a major character in the film, with some suspecting that further scenes were left on the cutting room floor. As for her age, even if she had been the main Bond Girl of the movie, she would have been the oldest as of filming but not the first one to be older than Bond. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HonorBlackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HonorBlackman">Honor Blackman</a> (Pussy Galore from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldfinger">Goldfinger</a></em>) was 5 years older than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaRigg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaRigg">Diana Rigg</a> (Tracy Draco from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a></em>) was a year older than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLazenby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLazenby">George Lazenby</a>. Incidentally, Belluci previously auditioned to play Paris Carver in <em>Tomorrow Never Dies</em>, who, as mentioned above, was also an example of this trope.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno">Juno</a></em>, Paulie Bleeker (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCera">Michael Cera</a>) was heavily emphasized in the promotional material and trailers. In actuality, he's a supporting character and goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> in the second half of the film.

In the actual film, Oldman appears in only a few scenes and is billed no less than tenth in the ending credits.
</li><li> Every original release poster and trailer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LawrenceOfArabia">Lawrence of Arabia</a></em> prominently features Jose Ferrer (Oscar winner for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CyranoDeBergerac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CyranoDeBergerac">Cyrano de Bergerac</a></em>) as the Turkish Bey, who appeared for two scenes totaling less than five minutes in length. Avoided through various re-releases, as Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif have long since eclipsed Ferrer's fame.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenaBonhamCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenaBonhamCarter">Helena Bonham-Carter</a> is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a></em> for about 10 minutes tops (in a 150 minute film). The marketing made her out to be the lead female.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RowanAtkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> was one of the actors featured on the posters for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually">Love Actually</a></em> and yet he only appeared in two short scenes and none of the threads in the movie featured him as a major character. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley">Keira Knightley</a> also got high billing (having just become well known with <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>), despite only being in four scenes and playing a supporting role in all of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Manhunter">Manhunter</a></em> was broadcast on TV immediately after the phenomenal success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></em> but the title was changed to <em>Red Dragon: The Pursuit of Hannibal Lector</em>. Of course, anyone who saw the movie in 1986 or read the book would realize that Lector (played by Brian Cox) had about eight minutes of screen time and being that the story is set prior to <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, Lector is still behind bars for the entire film. The character being pursued was a serial killer called The Tooth Fairy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> real name is Francis Dolarhyde</span>. Lector's influence is marginal and is mostly part of the main character's backstory. The name change and subtitle was just an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the recent 1991 blockbuster by broadcasting a little remembered film that was based on the previous book in the series.

<ul><li> Maria Hill was featured on many of the posters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> alongside the team and Nick Fury. Ultimately she gets one action scene to herself in the first ten minutes, and after that is mostly a bystander. As she has at least three deleted scenes, it's safe to say that much of her material was cut for time. Some have theorised it was an attempt to disguise the glaring fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">Black Widow was the only female Avenger</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> got a lot of presence in the posters and trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em>, despite his role being much smaller than in the first one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Agent13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Agent13">Sharon Carter</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>. She is heavily featured in the merchandise and promotional art for the film as a member of Team Cap, including illustrations of her fighting alongside the others against Team Iron Man. In the actual film, she never suits up in the uniform she's seen wearing in the illustrations, nor does she officially join Team Cap or fight against Team Iron Man.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em>:
<ul><li> Iron Man's supporting role was greatly played up, with the character being prominently featured in the marketing and merchandise. In reality, Tony only shows up in a few scenes, and only <em>one</em> of those actually has him wearing the armor.
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Zendaya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Zendaya">Zendaya</a>'s mysterious Michelle was prominently featured on the theatrical poster, even though the character doesn't get much screen time. This is particularly egregious since Ned, who has a much larger role, and Liz, who is Peter's <em>actual</em> love interest, aren't on the poster.
</li></ul></li><li> Odd example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>'s role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>. He only appears in one scene in the first act, and most of the promotion for the movie made sure to avoid exaggerating the size of his role. However, the preview for the movie included in the guide for the D23 expo definitely tried to make it seem like Strange had a much larger part than he actually does, likely due to the success of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorStrange2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorStrange2016">solo movie</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent">If you need even more intergalactic, world-saving action, <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> in November brings together Thor, the Hulk, and Doctor Strange to face off against intergalactic baddies both familiar and new.
</div><ul><li> Due to the massive success of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">his solo movie just a few months prior</a>, T'Challa and his supporting cast were heavily featured in most of the later marketing for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>. In the actual film, they don't really get to do much until the last act. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shuri">Shuri</a> in particular (who was very prominent in the print advertisements) only gets about two scenes before she disappears from the movie. This led to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HonestTrailers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HonestTrailers">Honest Trailers</a></em> jokingly speculating that Marvel did not expect the <em>Black Panther</em> film to be nearly as popular as it ended up being back when they were planning <em>Infinity War</em>.
</li><li> One year later, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanaiGurira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanaiGurira">Danai Gurira</a> billed and appearing on the poster, given she's one of the few main characters who survived the previous movie. She appears in at most three scenes, none very prominently. A minor case is again the star of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">the movie released right before</a>, Carol Danvers, who as soon as her movie became a hit got heavily promoted. She is sidelined by her own missions shortly after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, and only returns in the climactic battle in the third act - though her case is justified by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">Carol being as powerful, if not more, than the villain</a>.
<ul><li> Captain Marvel may be an exaggerated version of this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em> implied that she was only contacted due to Nick Fury's quick decision to message her, and thus she would be pivotal in the fight against Thanos. Not only was her role fairly insignificant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em>, the scene showing Fury activating her pager was irrelevant as well, because her part in the story begins once she discovers Tony Stark and Nebula adrift in space nowhere near Earth at all and the pager never being brought up. In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie">Trailers Always Lie</a>, she is shown demanding to know what happened to Nick Fury, dialogue which doesn't actually appear in the released film. Finally, dragging a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel">third film</a> into the false advertising, her solo film is almost completely unnecessary to watch to understand the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> or her role in it and she doesn't interact with Nick Fury at all in the latter film. One might suspect that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> was designed to help sell tickets to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel">Captain Marvel</a></em> but not enough footage was actually filmed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> to capitalize on the former film's success, nor was there time in the two months between films to give her a larger part in the story.

Willis is front and centre on the poster, despite only appearing in one early scene and a few sequences in the final act. This parodies a B-movie tradition of casting a name actor in a small part and then hyping them up as if they were the star. Note that Willis rarely shares the frame with another actor in the film, giving the impression that his shots were all filmed separately in one short filming session.
</li><li> The advertising for the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessDiaries">Princess Diaries</a></em> movie would have you believe Princess Asana, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RavenSymone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RavenSymone">Raven-Symoné</a>, was a main character. She wasn't.

The film draws elements not only from its own source novel (basically just the framing story, the book being mostly about the background which gets summarized in the movie in two sentences), but also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireLestat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireLestat">The Vampire Lestat</a></em>, and <em>he</em> is the central character along with love interest Jesse Reeves (whose actress, Marguerite Moreau, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirNotAppearingInThisTrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SirNotAppearingInThisTrailer">never even gets a mention</a>). There's also the fact that Akasha's actress, R&amp;B singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a>, died six months prior to the film's release, and the movie was heavily promoted as her last "starring" role.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RollBounce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RollBounce">Roll Bounce</a></em>, Nick Cannon and Mike Epps. Each are only in three scenes. Epps' garbageman Byron is pure comic relief alongside his partner Victor, played by Charlie Murphy, who doesn't even make the theatrical poster.

In the film he only has a few seconds of screen time at the beginning and end, with only one line of dialogue (part of the song at the end).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em> was a somewhat infamous case of this, since the marketing campaign for the movie focused almost entirely on the fact that it was going to feature a team-up between Captains Kirk and Picard, the protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Biggs Darklighter, Lukes best friend from Tatooine was almost completely cut out of the final film, save for his scenes during the Death Star battle. This didnt stop him from appearing in the tie in storybooks, comics, and at least one foreign poster (in place of Han Solo nonetheless).
</li><li> Boba Fett is one of the prime examples of this trope. His sheer popularity and prominent marketing would make anyone who isn't familiar with <em>Star Wars</em> assume that he plays a massive role in the story.

<ul><li> The trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersTheLastKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersTheLastKnight">Transformers: The Last Knight</a></em> made it look like Izabella would have a large role in the film. Instead, she disappears almost completely after the first 15 minutes — in a film that's nearly 2 hours and 30 minutes long — with only a brief return appearance near the end. It's not just Izabella, lots of characters appear in the initial trailer only to be given a limited amount of screentime.
<ul><li> Nemesis Prime, the brainwashed Optimus, who is implied to be major character in the previews and trailers, doesn't appear to fight Bumblebee until near the end of the movie.
</li><li> It also looked like Megatron would have a big role in the story, but after the first Autobot/Decepticon battle, which the Cons lost in the most embarrassing fashion ever, Megatron vanishes for the rest of the movie, and doesn't return until the climax, only to get one shotted by Optimus at the end.

The rapper plays a gang leader who is shot by Batista literally three minutes after being introduced. Fourth billed R&amp;B singer Omarion has a similar role to Ja Rule.

He only has three scenes: he refuses the cure and flies away; he very briefly shows up at the X-Mansion for the sole purpose of allowing them to state categorically that the school is still open; and finally he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">saves his father's life</span> during the final battle. He does nothing in between. The promo posters even showed Angel in an X-Men uniform despite the fact that he never officially joins the team (or dons a costume) during the movie.

Tony then spent most of the first half of the season off screen in a coma, then when it reached the halfway point he was seemingly killed off for the remainder of the season. He was in a quarter of that season's episodes in total, compared to the rest of the cast who all appeared in at least half of the season if not more.

</li></ul></li><li> Tom Wopat and John Schneider famously held out during the fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDukesOfHazzard">The Dukes of Hazzard</a></em> and were replaced by Byron Cherry and Christopher Mayer playing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">heretofore unmentioned cousins</a> Coy and Vance Duke. After Wopat, Schneider and the studio agreed to terms, Bo and Luke returned. Even though Coy and Vance left 15 minutes into Bo and Luke's first episode back and were never seen nor referred to again, Cherry and Mayer were still shown in the opening credits the rest of the season.
</li><li> In the early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, Dan Butler, who played Bulldog Briscoe. The character was <em>very</em> cut off from the "real" main cast of Frasier, Niles, Daphne, Roz and Martin, was a fairly two-dimensional coworker at KACL who only ever appeared as comic relief or a foil for Frasier or Roz, and had neither any specific importance to the show that would justify billing him along with the main cast, nor any deep connection to the rest of the billed characters. He was eventually dropped from the opening titles, appearing as a guest star in the end credits in the episodes he appeared instead. It's pretty jarring to see the character squeezed into promotional images and covers along with the five "real" leads, when Eddie the dog was more of a main character than he was. This was due to the original premise being that the series would focus on both sides of Frasier's life - work and home. They wanted characters from both sides to feature, and that's why Bulldog was in there along with Roz (because originally Roz wasn't supposed to become such close friends with Frasier). Obviously the dynamic changed and that's when they left him out of the photos.
</li><li> Grey Damon as Hastings Ruckle in Season 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FridayNightLights">Friday Night Lights</a></em>. Although billed as a main cast member, he gets fewer scenes than, for example, Dallas Tinker, who is listed as a guest star.
</li><li> The rules governing who will and who will not receive billing in the opening credits for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> seem increasingly arbitrary. Episode count and even amount of face time you receive per episode is apparently not a factor in whether or not you are billed in the opening credits as a regular or in the closing credits as a guest star. It is not uncommon for regular-billed actors to receive less screen time or appear in fewer episodes than non-regulars. Several of the actors billed as regulars are little more than semi-frequent guest stars, to wit:
<ul><li> In the first season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConlethHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConlethHill">Conleth Hill</a> appears in 6 episodes as Varys, but is billed as a guest star. He gets opening credits billing in every subsequent season, despite his appearances becoming less frequent. For that matter, Aiden Gillan's appearances have decreased each season, but he was credited as a regular from his first appearance onward.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoryMcCann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoryMcCann">Rory McCann</a>'s main role in seasons 1 and 2 is to stand around looking threatening, while uttering maybe one or two lines per episode. He is billed as a regular for both. He gets more screen time and character development beginning in the third season, though, and his development really took off in the fourth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCosmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCosmo">James Cosmo</a> appears in five episodes in the first season, three in the second and four in the third. Guess which season only credits him as a guest star?
</li><li> Nearly all the Dragonstone crew, actors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenDillane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenDillane">Stephen Dillane</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamCunningham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamCunningham">Liam Cunningham</a> and Carice van Houten, seem to appear very infrequently compared to nearly all the others. Ms. van Houten appeared only four times in the second season, while Cunningham appeared in 6. While van Houten's appearances increased in the third season's, Cunningham's decreased. They hardly appeared at all in the fourth season. They have all been billed as regulars from their first appearance.
</li><li> Hannah Murray (Gilly) was added to the opening credits in Season Four, despite appearing in only three episodes; only half the amount of appearances she had in Season Three.
</li><li> Harry Lloyd appeared in five episodes. Credited as a regular for all of them.
</li><li> The series mostly copes with this problem by changing its opening titles for each episode, depending on who's actually in the episode. Most prominently, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau appears in only a few episodes during the second season, but when he does, he's always the third billed behind Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey. This was already the case, though less noticeable, in the first season, since all the regulars from the first season, barring Mark Addy and Harry Lloyd, appear in at least eight of the ten episodes.
</li><li> Played about as straight as possible in "First of His Name". Peter Dinklage (Tyrion) doesn't appear, so Nikolaj Coster-Waldau gets top billing, despite his only role in the episode being standing silently watching Tommen's coronation.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tina, much of the time, is usually lucky to get two lines an episode. In the whole first season she had exactly one song to herself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessalynGilsig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JessalynGilsig">Jessalyn Gilsig</a> is credited as a regular for the first 2 seasons but Terri stops appearing regularly after the first 13 episodes only having a few scattered appearances afterwards. In season 2 she only appeared in roughly 6 episodes.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mother herself from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>. She's in the fricking title and finally appears for real in the eighth season finale and her story is finally told throughout the final season. Her actress, Cristin Milioti, is billed as a regular cast member, but only appears in only half the episodes. This is apparently due to a rule by the showrunners that she is to only appear in episodes they personally wrote.
</li><li> The advertisements for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em> episode "iFind Spencer Friends" hyped up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaStone">Emma Stone</a> as a guest star. When the actual episode aired however, we find out that she only appeared near the end of the episode, has about 30 seconds of screentime, and plays absolutely no role to the main plot.
</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey">Jim Carrey</a>'s first roles was in the 1981 television special <em>Introducing... Janet</em>, where he gets second billing and his character doesn't appear until after at least 15 minutes. That special was released on video in 1995, shortly after he'd become a big star, and the packaging makes it look like he is the star of the special, being the main focus of all video covers, the only actor whose name appears on the cover (despite getting second billing), the video description talks about him more than the main character Janet, and when released on video the special was retitled <em>Rubberface</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em>: Tracy Scoggins as Kat Grant, a society page reporter in the first season. Given little to do, dropped after the first season.
</li><li> Characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> are invariably either some of the most dynamic and developed characters on TV, or completely wasted.

Caesar was hinted as being mysteriously integral to the plot before Season 5 but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he dies less then halfway through the season.

She only appears in five out of 13 episodes in the first season, and she doesn't have any big impact on the plot after Matt saves her from the Russians. In the second season, she only has three episodes: an early episode where Foggy approaches her seeking help scouring the hospitals for Matt after he's captured by Frank, and later being asked by Matt and Brett to shelter kids they've rescued from the Hand (and later quitting when the Hand attack, and the hospital covers up the event). In between the two <em>Daredevil</em> seasons, she also got an extended cameo in the season 1 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>.

Additionally, regardless of how much screentime they get, the supporting cast in question all get title credits billing depending on if they were billed in the title credits of whatever solo show or shows they originated in.

Meanwhile, Amber Rose Revah (Dinah Madani), the actual female lead of the show, was practically ignored. The marketing team for <em>The Punisher</em> team was widely suspect by many to be trying to draw in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackShip">Kastle</a>" shippers and viewers from <em>Daredevil</em>, where Frank had originated, and Karen was the character who had the most screentime with him. In fact, Karen's inclusion wasn't a part of Steve Lightfoot's story plan at all to start, until he decided to find a place for her after watching her scenes with Frank in <em>Daredevil</em> season 2, which would explain why her scenes feel disconnected from the rest of the narrative.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieMcGrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatieMcGrath">Katie McGrath</a> who plays Morgana has been in the main credits since day one, but numerous episodes (especially early on) feature Morgana doing very little beyond looking beautiful in the background. Sometimes this even extends to periods of the show when her character is playing a vitally important role (such as early Series 4) but still often results in very limited screentime.
</li><li> Gregory Itzin was a series regular on the short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MobCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MobCity">Mob City</a></em>, but only appeared in four of the show's six episodes, and only had a speaking part in three of them.

His inclusion in the opening credits was sometimes questioned in later seasons, as he's now considered to be even less significant than other characters whose actors are not mentioned in the opening credit. He has been removed from the opening in season 9, but only because his actor BJ Novak has left the show rather than acknowledging that Ryan's role had diminished.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> Michael Raymond-James' character Neal Cassidy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> aka Baelfire</span> was written out of the series midway through season 3, but was still credited as a regular for the rest of it, even though he only made a few brief appearances in flashbacks for the remainder of the season.
</li><li> The show really hyped up Frances O'Connor being cast as Belle's mother for Season 4. She appears in one episode and only in the first five minutes.
</li><li> Alexandra Metz's casting as Rapunzel got a surprising amount of attention - for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">Race Lift</a> they gave the classic blonde, and the popularity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Tangled">Tangled</a></em>. She appears in a supporting role in just one episode.
</li><li> Season 5 heavily advertised that Lancelot, Ruby and Mulan were returning. Lancelot returns, has one episode in which he plays a decent role, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> with his story unresolved. Ruby and Mulan have just one episode.
</li><li> Subverted with the 100th episode. Cruella was advertised as returning, and only the outside of her car is shown in the episode itself. However she appears in subsequent episodes as part of a story arc.

The opening prominently credits "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln!" who never appears in the show itself. And then the episodes introduce a "Special Guest Star" who is promptly killed off in the credits and never appears in the show or is even part of the plot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSamurai">Power Rangers Samurai</a></em>, one of the selling points was the return of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Bulk</a>, now training Spike, the son of his former sidekick Skull. Unlike the early days of the franchise, Bulk and Spike only very rarely interact with the Rangers, almost never have any significance to the plot, and there are quite a few episodes that don't even include them at all. One scene where they do sort of interact with the Rangers outside an ice cream shot, they are shot entirely from behind, which only highlights how the majority of their scenes were shot completely separate from the main show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale">Riverdale</a></em> has Josie McCoy and Kevin Keller listed as main cast members, and they appear in its buffer promos for The CW. But by the second season both of them appeared with decreasing frequency and in the third they are both little more than extras and either do not appear in episodes at all or, if they do, may not actually be part of the plot or even have any lines.
</li><li> After not being included in the first two seasons of the show, the appearance of Tuck in the BBC's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> was loudly heralded amongst the advertisers for season three, and interviews with actor David Harewood mentioned a "dark back-story" for the character. Tuck gets one character-centric episode (which is just pointless filler), and is then a tag-along member of the gang from then on.

She's killed off in the pilot. In this case, she was meant to be in around nine episodes - but due to scheduling conflicts with her tour, she had to have her role cut down. To a similar extent, Charisma Carpenter (who played Grande's mother) was advertised as appearing on the show. She has just two brief scenes in one episode. Nick Jonas likewise was hyped up as being as prominent at Glenn Powell's Chad and Diego Boneta's Pete. He doesn't even appear in half as many episodes as they do.

Many of the video boxes for the individual shows released in the 90s show American <em>Sesame</em> Muppets front and center despite the fact that the Muppet on the box only appears in one partially dubbed segment in the show. An example is the Chanukah episode; the video box shows The Count and Elmo - they only appear near the very end during a dubbed "Do De Rubber Duck," where Elmo doesn't even have a line.

</li><li> From the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>: Yeoman Janice Rand was featured heavily in early promotional material alongside Kirk. In fact, she received more focus in the marketing than <em>Spock</em>, and was intended to have a major role as Kirk's recurring love interest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorInspiredElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorInspiredElement">Grace Lee Whitney also contributed to the development</a> of the tricorder and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerouslyShortSkirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerouslyShortSkirt">Dangerously Short Skirt</a> worn by female crew. However Rand ultimately only appeared in the first half of season 1 due to Whitney's dismissal.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ev75');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ev75" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ev75');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">With explanations ranging from not wanting Kirk to have a serious girlfriend, Whitney spurning the advances of (or fending off an outright <em>assault</em> by) a Paramount exec, to substance abuse problems making her difficult to work with.</span>
</li><li> Travis Mayweather on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em>. He was the pilot (when Captain Archer was also a pilot, and perfectly able to take over for Travis when needed) and had previous extensive experience in space (which was less and less of an issue as the show progressed).
<ul><li> To a lesser extent, Hoshi Sato from Enterprise also qualifies. She was the linguist and communications officer. Most of her work is not particularly interesting, so while she does get some scenes doing her actual job, she's more often treated as an office intern doing whatever odd jobs need doing. Since the show suffers from severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything">The Main Characters Do Everything</a>, this means she'll do things she is grossly unqualified for, such as manning the transporter (which 200 years later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> was manned at all times by specialist staff).
</li></ul></li><li> Harry Kim on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> applies as well, as with the exception of a few episodes that were specifically about him, he usually gets the obligatory one line.
</li><li> Jake Sisko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>. Despite being credited as a main character for the show's entire run, the Son of the Emissary appeared in less than half of the show's episodes. Not as strong a case as Mayweather and Kim, as Jake was a well-developed character who saw a lot of development during the series. That his actor was a teenager for much of the show provides a reason for his relatively small number of appearances, since he was simply unable to shoot as much as the adults.
<ul><li> Jake was also never intended to be a full cast member either: his purpose, when the show was created, was to provide fodder for Sisko, as the original idea for the show was "a father tries to raise his son on the frontier." (In fact, according to the original series bible, Jake was listed as a recurring character instead of a major one.)
</li><li> Becomes more blatant in Season 7, since not only is Jake <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> for much of the season, but the show's heavy usage of the same recurring characters means that several supposedly non-main characters (particularly Garak and Nog) significantly eclipse Jake in both screen time and plot relevance.
</li></ul></li><li> Jett Reno of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> was prominently featured in Season 2 trailers. She <em>was</em> a principal character in two episodes, but then disappeared for a large chunk of the season before showing up again in a couple of scenes for episode 12. (It may have something to do with the fact that she's played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TigNotaro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TigNotaro">Tig Notaro</a>.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MishaCollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MishaCollins">Misha Collins</a> is credited as a main cast member for all the season five and six episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> he appears in, including the ones where, in his own words, he "turns up, gives a piece of sage advice and disappears."
</li><li> The trailers for season 2 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titans">Titans</a></em> featured Aqualad, with some of the marketing making it seem like he'd be joining the team as a major character. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In reality, he turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">Posthumous Character</a> who'd already been killed off five years prior to the start of the show, and the only episode he actually appears in is a flashback detailing the events leading up to his death.</span>
</li><li> Suzie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em>, sort of. She was listed in the opening credits of the first episode, and released beside the rest of the cast as a major character. Suzie was a member of Torchwood at the start of the first episode, and quite important to the first episode. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She's the villain of the episode, and ends up dying by the end of it.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> Season 3 hyped up the new additions to the cast in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AliciaFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AliciaFox">Alicia Fox</a>. Paige was prominently featured, but Alicia appeared entirely in a supporting role. She didn't get an episode in which she did anything of note until the fourth season.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinConroy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinConroy">Kevin Conroy</a> was a member of the main cast for the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TourOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TourOfDuty">Tour of Duty</a></em>, but the writers could never figure out how to properly integrate him into the storylines, as his character was a commander who normally stayed on base. Stuck in Hawaii with nothing to do for most of the working week, he set up a small stand on the beach and sold sketch portraits to tourists out of boredom. His character was dramatically killed off before the end of the season.
</li><li> Jenna in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em>, really doesn't do anything of note despite being a main character. Also Tyler in the first season, who's sole purpose seemed to be getting in fights with people.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>, Teddy Dunn's character Duncan Kane was written out midway through the second season, but continued to get credited in the show's opening for that year. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This notably did help hide his surprise return in the season finale where the paid an assassin to kill Aaron Echolls.</span>
</li><li> Simon Reynolds as Daniel Dickinson in the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em>. A particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> case in that <em>several</em> of the "guest stars" appeared quite a lot more than he did in that span. A case can also be made for Leena (Genelle Williams) who was 'credits only' in four of the twelve first season episodes, and, generally, until her key role in the final story arc, merely puttering doing something intuitive, and not really essential to the 'A' or often even 'B' storyline. Of the thirty-eight episodes of the first three seasons, she was only in the credits for twelve, despite technically being main cast.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> didn't have much rhyme or reason to its opening credits. Early on they seemed pretty judicious about who got opening credits billing, even crediting people who had storylines centered around them as guest stars, but in the final season they moved a number of former guest stars into the opening credits, such as Neal Huff, Gbenga Akkinagbe, and Michael Kostroff, despite their characters not really doing anything more than they had in previous seasons. Also, Tristan Wilds and Jermaine Crawford received <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Promotion to Opening Titles</a> despite having less to do than the previous season.
</li><li> Sheena Easton, who plays Queen Anne, has a spot in the opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungBlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungBlades">Young Blades</a></em> despite appearing for about a minute each in two of the first five episodes — and one of those is just to explain that she's gone on vacation and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a> will take her place. She gets a larger role in the next few episodes, but still doesn't appear at all in 6 out of 13 of them.
</li><li> Dustin Brooks from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101">Zoey 101</a></em>. Through he is credited as a main character for all 65 episodes, he only appears in 25 episodes and rarely contributes to the plot in a major way.

The most common incarnation of this trope in music is when featured artists get credit either for backing vocals that would not be immediately notable, or an otherwise trivial contribution to the song. Another common phenomenon occurs when a musician becomes a big star, and recordings featuring them in minor instrumental or backing vocal roles at the start of their career are rereleased with their contribution exaggerated in the packaging.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw">Tim McGraw</a> has had this happen many times.
<ul><li> His collaborations with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorCouple">longtime wife</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithHill">Faith Hill</a> zig-zag this. "Let's Make Love" and "I Need You" had Tim as the lead artist, but were full-fledged duets that credited Faith; "It's Your Love" and "Meanwhile Back at Mama's" credited her for merely providing backing vocals, while "Angry All the Time" did not. On singles where Faith was the lead artist, "Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me" credited Tim's backing vocals, but "Like We Never Loved at All" did not (although he still appeared in the video).
</li><li> He got credit for singing a far-from-prominent backing vocal on then-labelmate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoDeeMessina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoDeeMessina">Jo Dee Messina</a>'s late 2001-early 2002 hit "Bring On the Rain". Even more, he already had a single out at the time ("The Cowboy in Me", which actually succeeded "Bring On the Rain" at #1).
</li><li> "Diamond Rings and Old Barstools" gives full credit for the backing vocals by Catherine Dunn (his cousin).
</li><li> And again in 2016, when McGraw got full credit for a barely discernible backing vocal on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigAndRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigAndRich">Big &amp; Rich</a>'s "Lovin' Lately".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeJones">George Jones</a> got chart credit for Shooter Jennings' "4th of July" even though his only contribution to the song was singing a few bars of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">He Stopped Loving Her Today</a>" at the end  a part that was cut out of the radio edit!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney">Kenny Chesney</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">The Wailers</a> sing a chorus at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyChesney">Kenny Chesney</a>'s "Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven", and still received chart credit despite their part being cut from the radio edit. Strangely, said credit did not show up until the song's second week at #1.
</li><li> Zig-zagged: "You and Tequila" and "Wild Child" gave full credit to backing vocalist Grace Potter (of Grace Potter and the Nocturnals), but "El Cerrito Place" in between did not.
</li><li> "Settin' the World on Fire" gives credit to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink">P!nk</a>, who gives barely noticeable backing vocals, but also sings one line near the end.
</li><li> Kenny also had an inversion when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait">George Strait</a> did not get duet credit on "Shiftwork" until it was halfway up the charts, as Kenny's label had to get permission from George's.
</li><li> An even more bizarre inversion is his guest vocal on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RebaMcEntire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RebaMcEntire">Reba McEntire</a>'s "Every Other Weekend". A few stations had been playing the song before it was a single, so it was just listed as "Reba McEntire with Kenny Chesney" on the charts. Once it was released as a single, Reba's label couldn't get permission to keep Kenny on, so the radio edit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">replaced his vocals</a> with co-writer Skip Ewing. However, due to Kenny's much bigger name recognition, most stations continued to play the Kenny version anyway. As a result, it was credited to "Reba McEntire with Kenny Chesney or Skip Ewing" for one week, then to <em>just</em> Reba for the rest of its run.
</li></ul></li><li> As with "Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven", David Nail's "Let It Rain" did not give credit to the barely-audible backing vocalist Sarah Buxton until it was just shy of #1.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrooksAndDunn">Brooks &amp; Dunn</a> split up, some of their solo singles displayed this:
<ul><li> Kix Brooks' "New to This Town" credits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eagles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eagles">Joe Walsh</a>, whose only contribution is a very short guitar solo.
</li><li> Bizarrely, Ronnie Dunn's "Damn Drunk" credits Kix Brooks for backing vocals. As Kix was always the less prominent of the two, it's a Brooks &amp; Dunn song in all but name.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly to the "Damn Drunk" example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WynonnaJudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WynonnaJudd">Wynonna Judd</a>'s 2004 single "Flies on the Butter" gave credit to Wynonna's mother Naomi, who provides backing vocals. Since they recorded as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJudds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheJudds">The Judds</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> prior to Wynonna's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">Breakup Breakout</a>, one is left to wonder why they didn't just credit it to The Judds — especially since "Stuck in Love" four years prior did just that despite being from an otherwise-solo Wynonna album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClintBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ClintBlack">Clint Black</a> also gave credit to his wife, Lisa Hartman Black, simply for singing backup vocals on "When I Said I Do" and "Easy for Me to Say".
</li><li> Inverted with Ty Herndon's "It Must Be Love". Sons of the Desert sing a very prominent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAndResponseSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallAndResponseSong">Call and Response</a> on the chorus, but received zero chart credit. On the other hand, Sons of the Desert <em>did</em> get chart credit on the country and Hot 100 charts for their counterpoint on Lee Ann Womack's "I Hope You Dance", even though the pop remix omitted them.
</li><li> Accordionist Flaco Jiménez got a credit on The Mavericks' "All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down" entirely for, you guessed it, playing accordion.
</li><li> Another strange inversion: Roger McGuinn and Chris Hillman of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheByrds">The Byrds</a> recorded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobDylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" (which the Byrds themselves had previously recorded in 1968) on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's 1989 album <em>Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two</em>. Even though the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band features prominently on this version, it was credited to just McGuinn and Hillman.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BradPaisley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BradPaisley">Brad Paisley</a>'s "When I Get Where I'm Going" credits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">Dolly Parton</a>, even though (as with "Bring On the Rain", above) she only sings barely audible background vocals that you may not even notice the first few listens.
</li><li> Also similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlisonKraussAndUnionStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlisonKraussAndUnionStation">Alison Krauss</a> and Billy Dean got credit for backing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers">Kenny Rogers</a> on "Buy Me a Rose". Dean can be heard echoing the line "rest of your life" on the final chorus, but he and Krauss are otherwise rather unobtrusive.
</li><li> Yet again with Krauss. She and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VinceGill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VinceGill">Vince Gill</a> can barely be heard singing backup on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkChesnutt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarkChesnutt">Mark Chesnutt</a>'s "It's Not Over", but they still got chart credit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraEvans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraEvans">Sara Evans</a> got full chart credit for singing backing vocals on The Warren Brothers' "That's the Beat of a Heart". To her credit, she sings one line by herself near the end.
</li><li> Similarly, John Rich sings backing vocals on Gretchen Wilson's "Come to Bed", and sings just one line on the bridge by himself, but still got full chart credit.
</li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlakeShelton">Blake Shelton</a>'s 2014 single "My Eyes", barely-discernible backing vocalist Gwen Sebastian (a contestant on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice">The Voice</a></em>, where Shelton is a judge) gets full chart credit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> has had several examples of this:
<ul><li> The group's 1979 album <em>Dynasty</em> featured Peter Criss on the cover, even though he played on only one song.
</li><li> Years later, the group's 1998 reunion album <em>Psycho Circus</em> prominently featured original members Criss and Ace Frehley on the cover and in promotions even though Criss only on one song and Frehley on two or three (Kevin Valentine and future member Tommy Thayer played drums and guitar, respectively, on most of the album).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TrishaYearwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TrishaYearwood">Trisha Yearwood</a>:
<ul><li> "Like We Never Had a Broken Heart" featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks">Garth Brooks</a> on backing vocals, which was enough to get him credit on the Canadian charts (this was before they sang duets together and got married). However, Garth did write the song for her (along with one of his usual writing partners, Pat Alger).
</li><li> She got full chart credit for a backing vocal on Josh Turner's 2008 single "Another Try", even though Yearwood had her own single ("This Is Me You're Talking To") out at the same time.
</li><li> Her 2014 single "PrizeFighter" has backing vocals from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KellyClarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a>, who gets full credit despite being only in the background.
</li></ul></li><li> An older example: Gus Hardin (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">a female</a>) had a Top 10 hit in 1984 with "All Tangled Up in Love". The song gave full credit to Earl Thomas Conley, whose only contribution was a barely-noticeable backing vocal.
</li><li> Yet another inversion: A then-unknown Janie Fricke sang the entire third verse of Johnny Duncan's "Thinkin' of a Rendezvous" but did not receive chart credit.
<ul><li> She did, however, receive credit for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerleHaggard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MerleHaggard">Merle Haggard</a>'s "Natural High" on which, as with many examples on this page, she only sang backup.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PixieLott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PixieLott">Pixie Lott</a> gets a "feature" credit on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez">Selena Gomez</a> song "We Own The Night" but she really only sings backing vocals. Even so, the backing vocals are almost buried in the mix.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ToddInTheShadows">Todd in the Shadows</a> references this in his review of "We Are Young" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Fun">fun.</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanelleMonae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JanelleMonae">Janelle Monáe</a>. He says that Monáe's part was so unobtrusive that he never even realized she was singing on it, then mocks the concept by claiming the video is now a crossover with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YouCanPlayThis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YouCanPlayThis">JewWario</a>, who appears on-screen for two seconds to say "hi".

It's supposed to be a duet, but Colbie's voice is so drowned out, it sounds like just Taylor sing. On a flipside, Taylor is this on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnMayer">John Mayer</a>'s "Half of My Heart" (who incidentally is an advertised on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy">Fall Out Boy</a>'s cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "Beat It", where he only plays the guitar solo).
</li><li> Numerous songs that feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheB52s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheB52s">Fred Schneider</a> as a guest just feature him making the occasional shout, rather than singing or rapping anything.
</li><li> One of the covers of "Big Yellow Taxi" is by the Counting Crows featuring Vanessa Carlton. However, her total contribution throughout the song is less than 15 seconds.
</li><li> Subverted/avoided in the song "Sixth Avenue Heartache" by the Wallflowers. Adam Duritz of the Counting Crows sings background vocals, but the song is not credited as being by The Wallflowers featuring Adam Duritz.
</li><li> Andrew Ridgeley of Wham! did not record very much with Wham!, but was always listed as a member. His contributions included the occasional guitar playing and co-write, but most of their work was down to George Michael and session musicians. Ridgeley was mainly listed as a band member for his sex appeal. This is why George Michael has gone seamlessly from Wham! to his solo career, but Ridgeley has floundered.
</li><li> Subverted with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw">Tim McGraw</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> duet "Highway Don't Care", which also features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithUrban">Keith Urban</a> on lead guitar (but not on vocals). The album credits both Urban and Swift, but on the charts, only Swift was credited due to her being the only one of the two who actually sings.
</li><li> "Hangover" is supposedly a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PSY">PSY</a> featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg">Snoop Dogg</a>. If you heard it without seeing who's credited, you could be forgiven for thinking that it's a Snoop Dogg song with PSY providing backing vocals.
</li><li> "Uptown Funk" is supposedly a song by Mark Ronson, featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrunoMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrunoMars">Bruno Mars</a>. However, one could easy think this is simply a Bruno Mars song with any random band playing (as opposed to many modern Santana songs where, despite the fact that he doesn't sing, it is easy to tell they are his songs by the guitar style).
</li><li> "Time of Our Lives" is a song equally credited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pitbull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pitbull">Pitbull</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeYo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeYo">Ne-Yo</a>, and it appears on both their albums. Honestly, it feels more like Pitbull featuring Ne-Yo, since he does 90% of the song. Pitbull does half the chorus and all the verses, while Ne-Yo only does the other half of the chorus and the bridge towards the end.
</li><li> Pharrell is credited as a feature in 2 Chainz' "Feds Watching", but apart of a very brief introduction, he only sings backing vocals in the chorus, which is completely unnoticeable without headphones.
</li><li> "Darker Than Blood" is by Steve Aoki featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a>. It actually feels closer to being "Steve Aoki featuring Chester Bennington", the other members make little contribution, and Mike doesn't rap in the song (he does give his vocals, but it's hard to notice).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> with Avicii's songs. The featured vocalists are never credited for their contribution, most notably Aloe Blacc in his smash hit "Wake Me Up!", despite the fact they sing the entirety of the song.
</li><li> "The South" by The Cadillac Three gave full credit to guest artists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DierksBentley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DierksBentley">Dierks Bentley</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloridaGeorgiaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloridaGeorgiaLine">Florida Georgia Line</a>, and Mike Eli (lead singer of the Eli Young Band), who sing "This is where I was born and this is where I'll die" during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubduedSection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubduedSection">Subdued Section</a>. However, most of this part was cut from the radio edit, so they are only heard for a few seconds on the radio edit. Even on the full version, their vocals are so closely blended that it's hard to tell who they even are.
</li><li> Ricky Skaggs is credited for barely-discernible backing vocals on High Valley's 2014 single "Make You Mine" in the band's native Canada. However, the American re-release two years later did not credit Skaggs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VinceGill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VinceGill">Vince Gill</a> is credited for an almost unnoticeable backing vocal and brief guitar solo on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisYoung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChrisYoung">Chris Young</a>'s 2016 single "Sober Saturday Night".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lonestar">Lonestar</a> lead singer Richie McDonald got full credit for a barely noticeable backing vocal on Mindy McCready's 1996 hit "Maybe He'll Notice Her Now".
</li><li> In 1994, record producer Scott Rouse remixed several of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy">Jeff Foxworthy</a>'s stand-up routines with musical backing, and usually choruses from contemporary country music artists as well. One of these, "Party All Night", credited Little Texas for singing the chorus... and oddly, also credited Rouse for his production work. This is especially odd since Rouse did several more of these (plus several more for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillEngvall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillEngvall">Bill Engvall</a>), and this wasn't even the first of the bunch, yet none of the other ones went so far as to give him a chart credit.
</li><li> Strangely inverted on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonnieMilsap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RonnieMilsap">Ronnie Milsap</a>'s 1988 hit "Old Folks". The song was featured on one of Milsap's albums, and credited as a duet with co-writer Mike Reid. However, Reid sings most of the song either by himself or with Milsap on harmony, with Milsap only singing the second verse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarenMorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarenMorris">Maren Morris</a> gets full chart credit for her barely noticeable backing vocals on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThomasRhett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThomasRhett">Thomas Rhett</a>'s "Craving You".
</li><li> Rodney Atkins' 2018 single "Caught Up in the Country" credits the backing vocals provided by the Fisk Jubilee Singers.
</li><li> Jim Brickman songs frequently invert this. As Brickman is only a pianist and not a vocalist, all of his singles feature vocalists who are credited, while his name is still on the song for his piano work.
</li><li> Ewan MacColl's track "The Manchester Rambler" has appeared on compilations of his daughter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KirstyMaccoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KirstyMaccoll">Kirsty MacColl</a>'s work, on the basis that she sings backing vocals on it. If that's true, then it's historically significant as both Kirsty's earliest known recording, and a unique example of the two generations recording together — but that still doesn't mean you can actually pick her out from the other backing vocalists, and it's by no means certain that she's actually on it at all.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/DisneyThemeParks">Disney Theme Parks</a>:
<ul><li> Let's say basically every time an attraction has a memorable original character that only shows up a few times, expect to see them in almost all the ride promos, and on tons of the merchandise. A good example would be the Hitchhiking Ghosts from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHauntedMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHauntedMansion">The Haunted Mansion</a></em>. They only show up at the end, but their scene is so recognizable that they appear on all of that ride's merchandise.
</li><li> There are some Disney properties that only have a show or a meet and greet, but they still get tons of attention in advertising. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a> only had a meet and greet and some merch throughout the parks, but got tons of promotion in the early 2010s at the height of their show's popularity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/StarTours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/StarTours">Star Tours</a></em>, C-3PO is quite prominent on the attraction poster, but only appears in the queue as an animatronic with R2-D2. However, this was averted when Disney updated the ride, because now C-3PO has accidentally become pilot of the Starspeeder 1000.
</li><li> With a show called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/MickeysPhilharmagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/MickeysPhilharmagic">Mickey's Philharmagic</a></em>, you'd expect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> to be the main character. In reality, although his presence is still there throughout the attraction, he only shows up twice at the beginning and the ending. The real star happens to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>.

<ul><li> In the American parks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> easily falls under this trope. He gets tons of promotion at the Orlando park, despite his franchise only being featured on a parade float, a meet and greet, and merchandising. However, he can be justified, as he's about as recognizable to the public as Mickey Mouse is at Disney World.
</li><li> Speaking of Nickelodeon shows, for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/JimmyNeutronsNicktoonBlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/JimmyNeutronsNicktoonBlast">Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast</a></em>, the characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> were shown a lot in earlier advertisements of the attraction, but they only showed up in the ride for like 5 seconds.

In the actual game itself, he contributes very little to the story mode and his arc is unresolved, instead ending on a blatant Sequel Hook.

When the game was released, however, Alisha turns out to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">only be playable for a short while early on</a>, the rest of the party seems to very swiftly forget all about her not long after she leaves, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">she's not even so much as mentioned for a very long time</a>, with the real female lead turning out to be Rose.

You're not even required to have yourself in the party, whereas the game forces Leo in at various story points.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, Hinoka easily has the least presence in the story of all the siblings from both sides. Unlike all the other siblings, she has barely, if any, impact or presence in the story besides her scenes in the pre-route split chapters and her recruitment chapters in <em>Birthright</em> and <em>Revelation</em>, meaning that virtually all her screentime is limited to supports and My Castle skits. Hell, it has actually been discovered that she has more story lines in <em>Conquest</em> than in <em>Birthright</em>, her own route! Possibly justified as she was added to the game fairly late into its development, after much of the story had already been finalized.
</li><li> The Avatar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem">Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem</a></em> is similar. Despite being promoted by trailers as a major mechanic (create your own Fire Emblem character), the Avatar has very little role in the plot past the Prologue, only existing as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">Satellite Character</a> others can provide exposition to, and aren't even required to be in the party for most of the game. The masked assassin Legion is another example: being featured very prominently in promotional materials and being one of the few new characters to get official art.

Of all of them, Kronya has the least amount of screen time, showing up in one chapter <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to kill an important character, before being killed herself</span>, and having almost nothing to do with the overall storyline. It seems like she was only added to <em>Heroes</em> because of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">distinct</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSells">appearance</a>.

Tentomon is only a common enemy in-game, with only his evolved form, Kabuterimon, available to the player character, so he is at least featured. Gomamon and all of his associated forms are <strong>entirely absent from the game</strong>.

However, while she is important to the game's backstory, her involvement in the actual game is much smaller than it should have been; she was originally supposed to be a party member and, in an alternate ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">replace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">Kreia</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>, but, like many other features, it was cut short by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">rushed development</a>.

<ul><li> The cover of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> features many of the important characters over the series, though some only showing up during the final battle (Terra, Roxas and Xion) with special mention towards Namine who only appears in an optional missable scene in "The Final World" and in the game's ending cutscene. The former scene is so easy to miss that several fans were surprised when her name showed up in the credits. Similarly is the Darkling from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsX">Union X</a></em> on the cover who doesn't even appear in the game at all.

As it turned out, that scene was Vanitas's only appearance in the entire game, and to add to that the line he says in the trailers is his only <em>line</em> in the whole game.
</li></ul></li><li> You'd think with a name like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skylanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skylanders">Skylanders</a>: Spyro's Adventure</em>, that famed PlayStation mascot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpyroTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpyroTheDragon">Spyro the Dragon</a> would be the main character, right? Wrong. Spyro's name was slapped on for being recognizable. In reality, Spyro's role in the game is no bigger than any of the other plastic toys. He isn't even the central character on the box art, that role belonging to Stealth Elf. As the series has grown in popularity, Spyro has only been pushed further away from the spotlight. He's still around, but it really doesn't matter if he's in the game or not at this point.

However, while they are all important characters, Navarre bows out of the story after the first dungeon and is never mentioned again save for one unimportant sidequest. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse">Apocalypse</a></em>, on the other hand, makes him a full-blown party member, subverting the trope.

In reality, the carnivorous dinosaurs are nothing other than FOEs patrolling the upper floors and the Herbivore Dinosaurs are revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater Scope Villains</a> who refused to confront any carnivorous dinosaurs at all and ostracized anyone who doesn't follow the decision made by the majority of herbivores.
</li><li> Similarly to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WhiteKnightChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WhiteKnightChronicles">White Knight Chronicles</a></em> example above, your created character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em> has almost no influence on the story, and might as well not even exist.

</li><li> Sega's <em>Rent A Hero No. 1</em> for Dreamcast, the remake of the Genesis title <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RentAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RentAHero">Rent A Hero</a></em>, featured in each and every piece of promotional material Rent A Hiroko, the titular character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a>. In the actual game, though, her presence is somewhat limited and, while the ending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">sort of implies</a> that she would have had a much bigger part in the sequel, no further games were ever made, thus making players wonder what all the fuss about her was about.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PulpAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PulpAdventures">Pulp Adventures</a></em> main menu screen is an artwork featuring several of the campaign's party members. While most of them are plot-critical protagonists directly involved in the plot, some others are much less prominent. Conan, Zorro, and the Lone Ranger are special characters only playable in their own level (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">said levels represent the protagonists of the main timeline reading books</a>). Also, the Spirit is available as a regular party member but he is completely optional (he must be bought with Prestige Points instead of being obtained for free when the plot proceeds).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Poliwhirl was ubiquitous in early <em>Pokémon</em> merchandise, despite being almost completely ignored in the games (it's the middle stage in an evolutionary line), and never having more than a cameo role in the anime's first two seasons. This may have been due to it being a personal favorite of Satoshi Tajiri, or possibly just the fact that its simple shape made it an easy merch target.
</li><li> With the start of a new generation, a Mythical Pokémon is generally revealed either first or very early on. As the name implies, Mythical Pokémon are unobtainable in a normal playthrough outside of limited-time events, and as such a player is likely never going to even hear of them, much less fight/catch them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em> were the first games to feature unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a> for each game, but Lugia and Ho-oh weren't important to the plot at all. In fact, you could beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> without ever fighting them.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> had Zorua and Zoroark as some of the first new Pokémon to be revealed. However, neither can be encountered in normal gameplay; they could only be accessed with event Pokémon (the events required to get either of them are long past) and aren't used by any trainer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aside from N in his final battle</span>. This is cited as one reason why Zoroark failed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">follow in the footsteps</a> of resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Lucario</a>, leading to Zorua and Zoroark becoming common in later games.

<ul><li> The game's trailers revealed Zygarde's new formes, which made it appear as if it would have a big role in the plot (particularly since, unlike Rayquaza, Giratina and Kyurem, it never got an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a> or sequels focusing on it). In-game, Zygarde is nothing more than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectionSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectionSidequest">Collection Sidequest</a> with no plot significance.
</li><li> The Ultra Beasts were hyped up as having a big role, while in the actual game only UB-01 Symbiont/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nihilego</span> has any role in the main plot, with the rest being shunted off to postgame status.
</li><li> The Tapus, despite being presented as Alola's revered guardian deities, play miniscule roles overall. While Tapu Koko gets decent screentime during the main game, the other three are never seen until the main story's over and are otherwise glossed over, receiving offhand mentions at best.

<ul><li> The Balrog Tar-Goroth was featured heavily in the game's advertisement, indicating he'd be a major antagonist working for Sauron and sent to hunt down Talion and the Wraith. Turns out in the game itself that he is a secondary villain with no direct relation to the plot - he was awakened by an entirely unrelated event and is causing destruction on his own. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He appears for only two missions very early in the questline he is involved, and he isn't even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, but rather the necromancer Zog the Eternal (who is trying to bind the Balrog to his service).</span>
</li><li> The Agonizer is a subversion: he got his own trailer, but he follows the exact same rules as every other orc, appears at random, and it's possible to permanently kill him during your first few hours, so he can be made one if the player so chooses.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> features five of its party members on the cover.

Especially egregious in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Royal Edition</a></em>, where she appears on the cover of the game, but her added screentime amounts to a brief cutscene of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her spirit appearing to provide a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> to help the heroes get past a magic barrier, with little in the way of new insight on the character</span>.

Saber Artoria Pendragon is also prominent in nearly all early material, if not outright front-and-center. However, while all of them are playable, most of the group aren't particularly plot-relevant; the first four at least have semi-prominent showings in various story chapters or limited events, but the others are lucky if they even get cameos. Artoria stands out in particular, because she's only appeared <em>once</em> in the entire main story, in a flashback. Ironically, the game showcases a lot of future versions or past versions or alternate versions of her, some of whom have been extremely prominent and popular... leaving the version of her that shows up in all the advertising in the dust.
</li><li> The trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HuntDownTheFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HuntDownTheFreeman">Hunt Down the Freeman</a></em> made it appear as though Gordon Freeman (the protagonist of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series of games) was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game.

</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E6BartStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E6BartStar">Bart Star</a>" was advertised as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossover</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> even though Hank Hill is on screen for only a few seconds. It probably set a record for shortest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossover</a> ever made. Additionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says these shows don't exist in the same Universe, making it even weirder.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS15E6TodayIAmAClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS15E6TodayIAmAClown">Today I Am a Clown</a>" Lisa mentions having an imaginary Jewish friend named Rachel who she created to make up for having no real friends when she was younger. Rachel finally makes an appearance in the 600th episode. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except that 600th episode is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS28E4TreehouseOfHorrorXXVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS28E4TreehouseOfHorrorXXVII">Treehouse of Horror XXVII</a>", and Rachel is a murderous spirit who kills all of Lisa's friends out of revenge for Lisa forgetting her.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a>'s appearance in Highway To Well was hyped up. He only has one line of dialogue and five seconds of screen time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>.
<ul><li> Parodied in the early episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS1E4BigGayAlsBigGayBoatRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS1E4BigGayAlsBigGayBoatRide">Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride</a>". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney">George Clooney</a> was advertised as a guest star on the show. Yet, in the episode itself, he is just Stan's gay dog, Sparky. All he does is bark. Similarly, another episode features Jay Leno providing the meowing sounds of Cartman's cat.
</li><li> Played straight, however, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IsaacHayes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IsaacHayes">Isaac Hayes</a> as Chef. The end credits for the first 9 seasons featured the credit "Featuring the voice of Isaac Hayes as "Chef"" right after listing the voice cast, even if Chef had no lines in an episode or didn't appear in the episode at all.
</li></ul></li><li> A ton of celebrities were advertised to appear in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> 10th Anniversary special, "Truth or Square" but almost all of them only made cameos, most of them don't even appear in the trimmed-down rerun version. <em>None</em> of them appear in the animated segments and instead appeared in the live-action Patchy segments. This trope is however, averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink">P!nk</a>'s appearance as she got to sing "We've Got Scurvy".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWarsSeasonSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWarsSeasonSeven">Season 7</a>: Obi-Wan Kenobi is featured <em>very</em> prominently in the poster for the season, standing alongside Ahsoka and Anakin and towering over the other characters featured in the poster. He pops up in four episodes and is only around for short periods of time in each one. Conversely, the Bad Batch and the Martez sisters are far more prominent, despite being smaller in stature on the poster.
</li><li> Most of the regular cast from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania">Taz-Mania</a></em> is acknowledged in the opening, including characters whose appearances were very few and far-between (including Wendell T. Wolf, Buddy Boar, The Kiwi, and The Bushrats). In fact, some of those characters who ended up appearing in many episodes (such as Digeri Dingo and Francis X. Bushlad) weren't in many episodes during the first season.
</li><li> Both Ironhide and Arcee were actually given this treatment in the Japanese opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. Ironically, according to the AllSpark Almanac, Ironhide <em>was</em> intended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">to become a main character</a> in the fourth season before the show was canceled at three.
<ul><li> Cliffjumper was one of the main advertising faces of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> promos, got a preview comic devoted to him and even a handful of figures when the toyline was released, and generally seemed to be the future main-character of the show. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He dies within the first couple of minutes of the pilot, then becomes a zombie and is killed again, and only gets a Flashback episode halfway through the series. After that, he received several <em>other</em> toys depicting him as a Terrorcon zombie.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>: Much of the marketing for Season 7 played up the importance of Adam, Shiro's ex-boyfriend. This even included images of Adam and Shiro being used as official headers for the show's Netflix page. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In reality, Adam only appears in two flashback scenes, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourGays">dies</a></em> at the end of the second. The character's fate and general lack of importance ended up igniting an internet firestorm, with one of the show's creators even issuing an apology on Twitter.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em>: Despite being one of the main team members in the intro, Beast is arrested halfway through the second episode and spends the rest of the season in jail, only appearing briefly a few times for the rest of the season. The following seasons would make up for this, making him a full-time member of the team again.
