At first, she may look intimidating and a little bit sinister, but soon we discover that she is genuinely a very kind, gentle, and caring person. For an Unseelie Fae, she is actually one of the most friendly and affable characters in the series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">She is also afraid of space aliens.</a> As Shinra points out, part of this may have to do with the fact that Celty's an <em>amnesiac</em> Dullahan. She might not have been so nice if circumstances were different (quarter-Dullahan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ruri Hijiribe</span>, for example, is a serial killer with a monster fetish).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> plays this trope dead straight with Rosine, a fairy-like Apostle who likes to carry kids off in order to turn them into her creepy little pseudo-elves in a rather twisted version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangelingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangelingFantasy">Changeling Fantasy</a>.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girl</a> Morgan Le-Fay is explicitly mentioned to be a fairy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> to Celestine, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">anti villainous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.</span> Though she's more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">lonely and broken</a> than properly evil.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, the so-called "fairies" of Dressrosa go around stealing people's valuables and causing property damage in urban areas. They are actually a race of little people called the Tontatta, who do their best never to be seen, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingToy">Living Toys</a> who also inhabit Dressrosa created and perpetuated the belief of the fairies. Their intentions are to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">observe and gather supplies needed to fight Don Quixote Doflamingo, the dictator of Dressrosa, and the Tontatta and Toys are allied with each other. The Tontatta provide the military might while the Toys manipulate the public image of their actions.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheAncientMagusBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheAncientMagusBride">The Ancient Magus' Bride</a></em> is another example of classical ideas of fairies. They prefer being known as 'good neighbors' in this manga, hearkening back to more Gaelic mythology. The rest of the series so far has kept up with this trend, using terminology and creatures from British mythology as well as others. However, some fairies from the series do eat humans <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including the titular ancient magus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">at least in the past</a>,</span> and in the very first episode, a group of fairies attempts to spirit Chise away into the fairy world (while she technically isn't in any danger of death, the fairy world does twist humans who stay in it, turning them into fairies themselves over time.) And then there's Ashen Eye, a rather malevolent and cruel trickster who is pretty much the single darkest take on the Fair Folk this series gets.
<ul><li> It is also implied that most fairies by nature have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">skewed understanding of morality</a> compared to human norms and don't feel emotions the way humans do. Elias Ainsworth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">who is at least part-Fair Folk</a>, starts with a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> and when he does develop emotions, he is clearly puzzled by what he's experiencing and unaware of how to deal with it. When he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attempts to save Chise's life by sacrificing one of her friends (purposely choosing this friend because he's jealous of the relationship she and Chise have)</span>, the Fairy Queen Titania chalks it up to him still "loving the way 'they' do", implying this kind of behavior is common for the faerie.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a> reinvigorated this trope for the modern era. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> directly crosses over with a number of other DC comics, meaning that nasty elves also play a part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBooksOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBooksOfMagic">The Books of Magic</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>, and several other Vertigo series.
</li><li> The female fairies in <em>Proof</em> look like cute little green people, but act like ferocious predators with huge appetites (e.g. after mating, the butterfly-sized female eats the male, who's about as tall as a house). Fortunately, these fairies are non-magical and an endangered species.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellboy">Hellboy</a></em>. "The Corpse" has Hellboy exposing a changeling and performing a number of difficult tasks for it so that The Fair Folk will return the baby he replaced. The story ends with the fairies discussing how few children have been born to them lately and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">how they may eventually fade away</a>, which likely partly inspired the Hellboy movie <em>The Golden Army</em>. Said changeling, seeking vengeance against Hellboy, becomes the driving force behind an army of fae seeking to restore the glory days. Restoring the good old days, or going out with a bang, they don't seem to be picky. Resurrecting an ancient sorceress named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">the Queen of Blood</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aka, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerlinAndNimue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerlinAndNimue">Nimue</a></span>) to lead the army adds destroying the world to the list.

They get together at a pub to express contempt for the film and the irresistible amounts of money that compelled them to take part in it, and the older Irish natives talk about the terror and brutality of the <em>real</em> fairy tales they grew up with. When Shade arrives and enters a fairy ring, his madness amplifies the effect across the entire country, with results deadly and deranging. The madstorm also wipes out the entire film production, to the relief of the surviving actors.

Malekith the Accursed calls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">The Wild Hunt</a> on Tony Stark pretty much entirely because he calls himself "Iron Man" and elves hate anything associated with iron since it's one of their few weaknesses. It should be noted one of the Mandarin's Rings wanted him to go after Tony as part of the rings' scheme and was set to mentally manipulate him into doing so, as the other rings had been doing to other wielders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">(It backfired horribly)</a>, but Malekith went along with it anyway, apparently for the hell of it. Gillen has stated that he wants the elves to come across as alien in mindset as anything Tony has encountered in outer space.
<ul><li> It also led to a profoundly satisfying moment or two when Malekith unwisely provokes Tony with a changeling crack or two (Tony had recently discovered that he was adopted), and gloats about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatsBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatsBabies">the sort of things the Elves did with the stolen infants</a>. He wanted to make Tony angry. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">It worked,</a> and Tony <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">singlehandedly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">carved a bloody trail through Svartalfheim</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">without once raising his voice</a>, using a suit armed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">Cold Iron</a> weapons, hunting down Malekith personally. Malekith, who it should be noted is someone who enjoys pissing off <em>Thor</em> (as in, he once cut off his arm and burned it to ash in front of him, and at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarOfTheRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarOfTheRealms">War of the Realms</a></em> told him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringIt">Bring It</a> while holding his parents hostage), admits that Tony on the rampage genuinely frightened him, and even years later, during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarOfTheRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarOfTheRealms">War of the Realms</a></em>, he takes the trouble to manipulate someone else (a dragon) into going after Tony rather than facing him himself.

The curse is softened, but cannot be completely removed, by the final fairy.
</li><li> The Fairy of the Desert in Madame d'Aulnoy's "The Yellow Dwarf" could count as one of these — she is a wise but malevolent being who looks more like a witch than a stereotypical fairy. She is allied with the Yellow Dwarf, and when Princess Toutebelle breaks her promise to marry the dwarf, the Fairy of the Desert and the Yellow Dwarf show up at her wedding to wreak havoc at the celebration.
<ul><li> Madame d'Aulnoy's works feature several other fairies who fit in this category, such as the Fairy of the Spring in "The White Doe", who curses Princess Desiree to not see sunlight for fifteen years in revenge for the queen forgetting to invite her (after she helped the queen out) and Carabosse in "Princess Mayblossom" (who curses the titular princess to spend her first twenty years miserable).

Two of the lovers are Miranda and Ariel from <em>The Tempest.</em> The fairies are portrayed as magical and amoral in creating illusions to fool mortals, have oracular foresight (though they say things do change), but have limitations. <br/>The fairies are still vulnerable to iron, because Ariel burns himself on a pot. They cannot enter Downton unless they are invited by Robert Crawley, the master of the house. Edith is not able to follow the fairies on her own, she must be led by someone she knows and trusts so Ariel enchants Thomas first. The World of Faerie is shown by magical creatures living in rocks, trees, and are in tune with nature such as their homes are built with outdoor views. It is based on various sources particularly Shakespeares and the world of artist, Brian Froud.

They may look pretty and generally friendly (and in Luna's case boisterous), but as Team Flare and Ash can both testify to, they are not to be trifled with.
</li><li> A popular concept in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> fan works is for the ancient and inexplicably powerful Kazami Yuuka to be a fairy. Who as she grew stronger became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> that's familiar to fans, the implication that this can happen to any fairy as they grow in strength. Such as Cirno, who in canon is on the low end of the power scale among <em>Touhou</em> characters but abnormally strong among fairies, and seemingly gets stronger with each of her canon appearances.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheBridge">The Bridge</a></em> establishes that fae folk did once exist in droves on Terra in the Pleistocene , often existing by themselves or with ancient humanity in advanced civilizations that inspired the likes of Shambhala and Atlantis. They originated because massive amounts of mana made some populations of humans evolve into naturally magical species, explaining why so many fae folk and yokai look humanoid. When mana levels plummeted after the Toba catastrophe 70,000 years ago, and the sacrifice of what remained to create the guardian beasts like Gamera, most of the fae folk turned back into humans over the generations, but on rare occassions a new fae might be born to keep legends alive and some survivors like the three Shobijin sisters persisted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Spellbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Spellbound">Spellbound</a></em> reinterprets many of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> characters and events in terms of fae magic.

Chloe is another half-fae, explaining a great deal of her cruelty, while Sabrina is a selkie whose coat was stolen, enslaving her to Chloe's family. When the kwamis show up, they aren't happy about one of the fair folk holding a Miraculous, but Plagg gives Adrien a chance because the situation is urgent. Adrien's innate magic has side effects on Miraculous usage, though.

</li><li> A lot of classic Scottish fairy tales have these, but just as easily have helpful fairies. They're probably most frequently seen in stories involving Changelings, but are seen as being somewhat interchangeable with trolls.
</li><li> Medieval ballads have a whole subgenre dedicated to the fair folk. In a Scandinavian ballad, the hero denies the Elf-maiden's request to dance, because he is preparing his wedding. The Elf-maid then strikes him down, with fatal consequences.
</li><li> The Curupira from Brazilian folklore looks like an amalgam between indigenous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit">nature deities</a> and European faeries. Regardless of his origins and his role as a fierce nature guardian, he is generally perceived as a wicked, demonic and sometimes downright sociopathic entity with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilRedhead">beautiful red hair</a> who can (and will) do anything to protect the animals and forests of his domains. He is particularly infamous for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSeducer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSeducer">shape-shifting into attractive forms</a> to lure abusive hunters and woodcutters deep into the forest. The footprints of his backward feet will ensure anyone who follows him will never find the way out from the woods and there he promptly starts a Wild Hunt, hunting the men down with a giant wild boar and ultimately destroying them.
</li><li> Púca/ Pooka of Irish mythology. In the original mythology Púca were sociopathic shape-shifters, whose favoured form was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse">huge, black demonic horse</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalGoldEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalGoldEyes">glowing yellow eyes</a> and whose other forms always had dark colourations/clothing and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">suitably wrong</a>, who only behaved themselves one night of the year (the first of November, when they are tired after running riot at Samhain/Halloween), and couldnt enter any dwelling uninvited or stand the touch of iron, but could stand outside your home and destroy your crops if you angered them and refused to come out and face them. When not riding along the hills and woodlands terrifying honest travelers, they blighted any crops left un-harvested after a certain amount to time. Or they demanded a share of all crops, newly made beer, or newly gathered milk, and if they didn't get it theyd trample fields, sour beer, render cattle barren (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingSquick">used their shape-shifting ability to impregnate them with mutated offspring</a>). In their horse form, they lured young men who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">drunk on pilgrimage or profaning the Sabbath</a> into trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">ride them out of machismo</a>, at which point the Púca horse vanishes and the young man is either never seen again or changed forever, and tried to lure solitary milkmaids or other naive, lonely maids to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveYouNowMyPretty">undisclosed fate in fairyland</a>.
</li><li> Ireland's local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp">psychopomps</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurBansheesAreLouder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurBansheesAreLouder">banshee</a> (more strictly bean sidhe) and dullahan, were faeries. At least the banshee was only interested in warning whatever clan she was associated with that one of their own would soon die. The dullahan? <em>He actively chases you down.</em> So, you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadlessHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadlessHorseman">Headless Horseman</a>, probably riding a Headless <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse">Horse</a></em>, carrying his necrotic head under one arm and using the other to snap a human spine as a whip, dousing any would-be spies with blood (which marks <em>them</em> as next to die), and whose mere presence <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillNotEvadeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWillNotEvadeMe">makes every gate and door unlock, unbar, and open on their own</a></em>, seeking you out. Hope you have some gold handy (a gold pin is enough), because that's the <em>only</em> thing that will save you (they're terrified of the stuff).
<ul><li> There was also a folkloric tradition that certain banshees were ghosts. This is because in the actual folklore, the line between the Fair Folk and ghosts was not so clear-cut as you might think it would be.
</li><li> Another notable Irish fairy is the Gancanagh. A handsome and vain male, the Gancanagh is your basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">Casanova</a> who goes around seducing human women, and carries around a pipe, which can be a big clue as to his identity. However, it is said to be extremely unlucky to meet him, and the women he seduces will fight to the death for his affection.
</li></ul></li><li> The Tylwyth Teg of Welsh-Celtic folklore spent most of their time cheerfully kidnapping human children, presumably by way of recreational activity. According to ancient folk wisdom, the best way of killing a changeling child was to pop it in the oven.
</li><li> The Nuckelavee of the Orkney Islands was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> of the purest sort. Visually similar to the Irish dullahan, this sea-fairy resembled either a centaur or a horse and rider fused together, looked as if it had been flayed alive (like the Colossal Titan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>), had black blood coursing through distended yellow veins, fins for feet, one eye and a perpetually gaping mouth, was enraged by the scent of drying kelp (among other things), and rampaged across the land, killing crops, infecting livestock and eating people. Its one consistent weakness was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotCrossRunningWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotCrossRunningWater">an aversion to fresh water</a>.
</li><li> In Scandinavia, the Fair Folk are called Underjordiske ("The Underworldly").
<ul><li> The <em>Hulder</em> appeared as a female with a cow's tail. Some of the hulders married mortal men, and lived with them, sometimes showing off badass strength, like straightening horse shoes, but were more known for seducing men and taking them into the mountain, where they could spend years without realizing. Featured in the Norwegian movie <em>Thale</em>. She is occasionally called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">Troll</a>.
<ul><li> The hulder does appears as a separate creature from the related skogsrå in some western parts of sweden. She appears almost the same except he's associates with snow and mountains and lives under the ground like the Vittras. Like mention before she should not confuse with the Skogsrå who are spirit guardians of the forests. Skogsrå's appearance and character varies depending on region but she's often depicted to either have a hollow back, hoofed feet (Scanian depiction) or a fox tail and could be, although extremly rarely male. None of the swedish hulder and the skogsrå is know to have any special powers.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nisse (Norwegian) or Tomte (Swedish) was a gnome-like creature that lived on farms and helped farmers with taking care of animals and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FertileFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FertileFeet">keeping the soil bountiful</a>. Though mostly benevolent, they're still Underjordiske, and if they were disrespected, they could cause mischief, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">kill every single animal, tear down the barn</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland">turn the soil infertile</a>.
<ul><li> The Swedish Vittra, however, were much more unpredictable than the Nisse/Tomte. They looked like and behaved like regular humans, but they lived "underground". They were just about as likely to bless humans and give them riches and fortune for little to no reason as they were to curse them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">A Fate Worse Than Death</a> for absolutely no discernible reason. A quick and easy way to <em>really</em> get them pissed off at you was to build your house on top of their house.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nøkk (or Nyx) was a Scandinavian water spirit who could appear as a beautiful man or white horse, but who's real form resembled a bundle of twigs floating in the water. He would use his supernatural charm to lure people into the water to drown them, but lost power over the victim if they shouted his name. Fossekallen was similar, but only appeared as a man, and would use his fiddle to charm people instead. He also lived in waterfalls (Foss in Norwegian). Some lucky humans could learn from him, and become almost supernaturally good at playing the fiddle.
</li><li> Draugen (an individual, unlike the Norse version) was a stubborn and evil sailor who died at sea. He would return as "Half a man, in half a boat", and bring storms and suffering with him. In one story, a whole hoard of Draug chases after a man, but he is saved by the dead of a nearby graveyard.
</li></ul></li><li> Icelandic folk tales tell of another people, the <em>Huldufólk</em> (hidden people), which live alongside humans, but invisible to us unless they wish to be seen. They are much like humans in appearance, and they live as people do, only to us their houses appear as rocks, boulders, cliffs and hills. Sometimes their interactions with humans would be pleasant, in particular if a "huldukona" (female) was in need of a midwife, and a human would oblige their request. At other times the huldufólk would leave their old and infirm as changelings, taking the human children to rear as their own. They would bewitch both men and women to join them in the cliffs, and they would tempt humans waiting by crossroads on specific dates.
<ul><li> The huldufólk are the "elves" that Icelanders allegedly still believe in (in truth this belief is generally either shallow, or very strongly flavoured by popcultural depictions of benign elves from other folkloric traditions).
</li></ul></li><li> The Redcap/Powrie. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">maliciously murderous</a> fae who lived along the old Scots-English Border, he amused himself by randomly murdering people, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">devouring</a> them, and all just so he could dip his hat in their blood. On the other hand, powries <em>needed</em> to keep their caps blood-suffused, lest they die. Possibly justifies the actions, but not the glee they take in them...
<ul><li> County Durham and Tyne-and-Wear boast the tale of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLambtonWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLambtonWorm">the Lambton Worm</a> (think "serpentine river dragon stuck in a well — carved into Lambton Hill"). No, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">the massive worm with great googly eyes</a> <em>probably</em> isn't fey (maybe; it could be — or some other polymorphed, bound and geased innocent guarding the water, well and/or hill), but, the mysterious, exposition-rich <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor">old man/ men and/or woman</a> (it varies according to the version) by the river who (repeatedly) sets the plot rolling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">along rails</a> by prodding John into foolhardy acts of certain, very blood-drenched (and eventually, but inevitably, <em>cursed</em>) doom under the banner of heroic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">dragon-slaying daring-do that will be immortalised in song</a>? Could very well be a single, somewhat cleaned-up pworie (or some cousin, a witch/warlock or a devil) taking advantage of the sinning, unsanctified, <em>unprotected</em> and headstrong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">John</a>... and his entire line of male descendants. At least until either they or the curse finally stutters out. All presumably for the giggles as much as the guaranteed sustenance for decades after indirectly offing a possible rival. Moral of the story? Go to church, triple-check your information sources and ask yourself if you're <em>really</em> hero material rather than, say, a patsy.
</li></ul></li><li> The caoineag is a Scottish version of the banshee. The problem? She also has a bit of the dullahan's philosophy — meaning she sometimes seeks out and kills people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">on her own initiative.</a>
</li><li> Stories of the "Little People" pervade the legends of many North American tribes. The Cherokee in particular have many legends surrounding them, and group these fairy-like beings into three clans; the Rock People, the Laurel People, and the Dogwood People. The Laurel people were considered to be friendly and playful, and often played games with children. The Dogwood People were stern, serious, and preferred to be left at peace. The Rock People, who lived in caves far away from human settlements, were feared, as it was believed that disturbing them would provoke their wrath, and whomever did so would have some horrible calamity befall them. Cherokee in more isolated regions to this day still believe in the legends, and it is said that if a child has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">Imaginary Friend</a>, this is actually the Little People playing with them.
</li><li> The Seminole have stories of little people who live in hollow logs out in the woods. When lightning strikes a tree, it is thought to be the gods trying to fry the mischievous little things. They are best known for leading people astray in the woods, and you are never supposed to call to a companion who is out of sight. It is likely to be the little people responding to you in their voice to lead you astray.
</li><li> In the Philippines, stories of "Engkanto" abound. These elementals come as close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> as they do to this trope with the forms they take varying on both witnesses and folklore. They may even take the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> at times if it would help their position.
</li><li> Among the Yup'ik Eskimos, the word "ircinrraat" (singular ircinrraq) covers many beings which are like the European Fair Folk. The word also covers a specific species, about three feet tall: if you fight an ircinrraq, it is advised to fight them until they offer you a gift, which you should accept. They also like to mislead travelers, which can be a matter of life and death. One story involves a village of ircinrraat and a village of humans which were in close contact, so the humans were invited to an ircinrraq potlach of food, fur and dog feces. A particular poor family was advised by an ircinrraq friend to collect dog feces they found alongside the path. As they neared the village of the ircinrraat, the dog feces became fur and food, while the fur and foods of their neighbors transformed into dog feces. Another notable legend involves a man who saw the ircinrraat dancing, and watched for what seemed like a few minutes. When he looked away, a year had passed, just like in many European stories where joining a dance of the Fair Folk causes a great deal more time to pass than is experienced by the protagonist. An interesting aspect of ircinrraq stories is that many of them mention how, if you encounter these people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">your mind will specifically refuse to acknowledge them as ircinrraat</a>: this goes a long way towards explaining why the humans in these stories never act the way the other stories warned them to.
<ul><li> Qamulek is an individual creature in Yup'ik mythology, which can be inadvertently summoned by the best hunters. He is a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, with a face that cannot be described, and constantly drags a sack behind him. If a hunter kills the Qamulek, he will be warned not to look into the sack, with good reason: great hunters who look into this bag will become quiet, humble men until the day they die. They will retell the story of their encounter with the Qamulek, but never describe what they saw within the bag.
</li><li> Orcas are often considered to be a variety of ircinrraat. It is warned that, if a man kills an orca, a member of his family will sicken and die within the year; the omen of death is similar to the banshee or bean nighe of Gaelic mythology, but the human has a more active role. It's also said that, if you're in the sea when a pod of orcas catch a beluga, you can give them an offering: if they accept it, they will give you a perfectly square slab of beluga oil in exchange.
</li><li> The Cingssiigat are a variety of ircinrraat which are about a foot tall. They lurk around abandoned sod houses, and also have very useful objects that can be taken.
</li><li> The Egassuayaq are a variety of ircinrrat with vertical eyes and sleeves that touch the ground. Their main activity is stealing fish from human trals.
</li></ul></li><li> Many other legendary monsters of Native American peoples would have fit in with the "fair folk" of older European folklore, but are more likely to be listed as monsters, giants or spirits in anthropological sources, which are still strongly rooted in Victorian-era European concepts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BabaYaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BabaYaga">Baba Yaga</a> displays many qualities of Fair Folk in Russian storytelling, though is often referred to as the "Witch of the Iron Forest".
<ul><li> A lot of the less human friendly Russian <em>nezhit</em> and <em>nechist</em> such as the leshay, the vodyanoy, the kikimora and the like are quite similar to the less fair kinds of the Fair Folk.
</li></ul></li><li> Korean folklore has a class of supernatural beings called <em>dok'aebi</em>s, who have unusually many similarities with the Fair Folk as shown in European folklore. They are ruled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">an incomprehensible sense of ethics</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">a desire for general fun</a>, as frustrating as that might be for poor human victims. Many surviving folk legends depict them as benevolent tricksters, but historical accounts still suggests that they were also seen as monstrous forces as heartless as natural disasters. The translation convention for dok'aebis used to be "ogres" due to their aesthetic association with Japanese oni, but because of their characteristic, terms such as "goblins" or "fae" have been taking over recently.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMermaidsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurMermaidsAreDifferent">Merfolk</a> can have some of these traits for folk along the coast.
</li><li> In <em>The Discarded Image</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> used as a general summation of creatures from this tradition the term Longaivi (Long-Livers because they, well, lived a long time). One thing interesting he pointed out was that that in later eras they underwent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grimmification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Grimmification">Grimmification</a> to the point where they were little different from demons, while the earlier Medieval ones could be benevolent as well as malevolent in their erratic behavior. The later cute fairies, according to this, were in fact a reaction to a reaction.
</li><li> In Mexico, the chaneques (chaneque in singular, from nahuatl those who live in dangerous places or the owners of the house) from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/AztecMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/AztecMythology">Aztec Mythology</a> could fit here. Theyre entities associated to the underworld, they live in the forests, lakes, rivers and jungles. Their main activities are watching the mountains, springs, trees and wild animals. They tend to pass their time playing mischiefs to mortals like throwing stones, breaking things, shaking hammocks, pulling dogs tails, frightening farm animals, stealing stuff and like that. Theyre also related to health and the lack of it, especially illness related to the loss of soul, but they can also reward mankind with wealth and good fortune. In some zones of Veracruz, theyre divided in two kinds: good and bad. The first type appear in zones where mankind lives. The latter prefer secluded places, undisturbed by human civilization. There are different descriptions of their physical appearance: 1) theyre people about 1 or 1.2 meters height, their feet are the other way around, malformed body, they have tails and they dont have the left ear; 2) theyre short people, with big heads and chocolate-like skin color; 3) theyre dwarves with childlike faces, and/or 4) they look like small children. Their boss is Chane, god of soil and water, who cares for humans, but punishes sinners, especially adulterers, using two magic animals: luputi the donkey and shunuti the cat. Chaneques also put spells on children to take them away from home, keeping them as servants. Mothers, to avoid this, give amulets to their children like the deers eye (actually a brown seed), crosses made of palms and put their clothes on the other way around. In fact, they can also make travelers lose their way, so to avoid this, they must wear their clothes the other way around. They can also make humans lose their tonalli (a spirit associated to a person's birthday), which can only be undone with a special ritual. In Chiapas and Tabasco they can be worse, because they attract boys for harmful intentions, but amulets made of nuts and river stones can keep them away.
</li><li> Nymphs in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> were well-known for being beautiful female spirits of nature that have been flanderized into getting frequently ravished by gods and monsters. With that said, they could get really scary when they wanted to: they arranged blights and plagues towards any farmer that earned their hatred for disrespecting nature. In one myth, they kidnapped Hercules' sidekick Hylas because they found him hot and he became their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a>, and in one version of Perseus' myth, his future wife Andromeda was about to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">sacrificed to a sea monster</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu">her parents boasted</a> that their daughter was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">prettier than the sea nymphs</a>. The worst of them all were the Maenads, the insane followers of Dionysus whose name literally means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">"the raving ones"</a>, and were frequently in a state of ecstatic frenzy and intoxication. They killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Orpheus</a>, who had just crossed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> after losing his wife, by <em>brutally quartering him</em> because he wouldn't honor their god.
</li><li> Although the Olympian deities have not been worshiped in Greece for millennia, belief in nymphs survived throughout the rural areas as recently as the 20th century. Over the centuries, the nymphs, referred to as Nereids, acquired many similarities to the Fair Folk of Celtic legend, even sometimes kidnapping human infants, replacing the stolen child with one of their own. This behavior is reminiscent of changeling myths, but more commonly, the beings gathered in lonely places at midnight (or occasionally, at noon when the Mediterranean sun was at its zenith) so that they could sing and dance. Human travelers who had the misfortune of meeting them in the woods or by a spring or wherever the Nereids had gathered were at risk of being inflicted with madness or some other ailments.
</li><li> As far as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a> go, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMothman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMothman">The Mothman</a> fits the criteria quite well largely due to its connection to the 1967 Silver Bridge Collapse that occurred during the apex of the sightings. Some say the creature was the cause of the collapse, some say it was here to warn us, and others say it was merely an observer to the disaster. Or, it was just an unrelated coincidence, which raises the question of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">just what was it doing there in the first place</a>.

</li><li> The Sisters of Orion, Yon'ro, the other Shanda'ryn hybrids, Pleiades and the Alteriens in their true form all fit this trope nicely. They are important characters in Adam R. Brown's sci-fi series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Alterien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Alterien">Alterien</a></em>.

She wound up in prison for a few years, was allowed home to die, and on her deathbed instructed Andrew to destroy a magical box that she had hidden. He instead used it to make the magic rings that kick off the book's plot.
</li><li> The fey of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreystoneValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreystoneValley">Greystone Valley</a></em> seem to be comprised of just about every fair folk from real-world mythology.
</li><li> The fey of Maggie Stiefvater's books <em>Lament</em> and <em>Ballad</em> are exactly this — entirely devoid of empathy, governed by rituals and care only about their own pleasure, thinking of humans as little better than playthings. Nuala, being a <em>leanan sidhe</em> is an exception; she is very close to humankind and is thus capable of human feelings. However, even she has a distinctly cruel and exploitative side... (it goes with the territory considering what type of faerie she is.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing">The Once and Future King</a></em>, the Faeries appear, led by Morgan Le Fay. While it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a> at the time the book was written, the Faeries are much more the alien and malicious type. Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Robin Hood and Maid Marian</a> argue whether they are Faeries or not.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurMachen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurMachen">Arthur Machen</a> went back to the earliest folklore and legends and created a particularly nightmarish version he called the Little People. They appeared in his famous stories "The Shining Pyramid" and <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Impostors">The Three Imposters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.

Machen was a huge influence on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P.

</li></ul></li><li> Certainly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianFroud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianFroud">Brian Froud</a> belongs at the top here. Modern audiences must have had a shock when his collaboration with Alan Lee, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Faeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Faeries">Faeries</a></em>, hit the shelves. It was one of the first books to include as many scary Fairy stories as nice stories. Froud has vocally emphasized that, while there are indeed evil Fairies and good Fairies in mythology, the vast majority of them are neutral. He actually apologizes, in the introduction, for the self-contradictory title of his follow-up book, <em>Bad Faeries/Good Faeries</em>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronAllston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AaronAllston">Aaron Allston</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DocSidhe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DocSidhe">Doc Sidhe</a></em> the Fair Folk are just as morally varied as humans are. Furthermore, the Fairy World has advanced at the nearly same rate as the human world, so fairies in the 1990s have 1930s level technology, mixed with magic (which is no longer called magic because it can be studied scientifically), and they've interbred with humans so many times as a result of changelings and other visitations that most are nearly human height, and one of the fairies is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage">Doc Savage</a>.
</li><li> The Moorfolk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoorchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoorchild">The Moorchild</a></em> fit the description to a T. They've an aversion to holy water, Rowan wood, St. John's Wort and other yellow flowers, iron (in the setting, ALL iron is Cold Iron), and salt. They kidnap children and replace them with their injured, elderly, and misbegotten (the protagonist herself is a changeling left in place of a human child for being half-human), they play pranks and steal from mortals constantly, and while life in the Mound is happy and carefree, they have no concept of love, hate, or empathy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoraWilkSeries">Dora Wilk Series</a></em> calls them Elves, but they fit this trope more. Any promise made to them, even without the intention to make it, has to be fulfilled, they play with words, offer bargains which always have a hook, and compel people to come to them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic">Magic Music</a>. They're actually the only creatures with whom Dora is careful of what she's saying.
</li><li> In the works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson">Poul Anderson</a>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThreeHeartsAndThreeLions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThreeHeartsAndThreeLions">Three Hearts and Three Lions</a></em> has this in the guise of local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">elves</a> — inhumanly beautiful, callous, afraid of sun, iron and holy names, manipulative, and in league with demonic powers against the world of humans.
</li><li> <em>The Queen of Air and Darkness</em> riffs on this trope by having telepathic aliens on a frontier world use the legends of Faerie against the human settlers, right down to kidnapping children to use as changeling warriors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBrokenSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBrokenSword">The Broken Sword</a></em> is a fantasy novel about Dark Age Europe coexisting (unknowingly) with amoral elves, trolls, etc. Poul includes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> passage wherein an elf lord creates a changeling using an enslaved she-troll. The changeling gets even, kind of. Several of Poul Anderson's other novels and at least one short story also deal with the Fair Folk.
</li><li> One of his story inverts much of this trope: an iron-allergic member of the Fair Folk pretends to be an alien emissary to infiltrate and destroy the real alien multi-species conspiracy that has infiltrated and is abusing human society, using a nonferrous spaceship barely able to make orbit as his alien bona fides. Oberon et al. show up on the last two pages.
</li><li> "Fairy Gold" has an elf get a human to kill a troll in return for fairy gold. It does the usual effect of vanishing — except that by the time it does it, it has moved full circle around the town, making many people happy by letting them buy something by selling something they were encumbered with. There's laughter when it vanished, but it's not quite clear whether the elf lord appreciates what he did.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tinker Bell is mischievous and rather possessive of Peter, to the point that she is perfectly willing to casually engineer the death of a perceived rival. Fairies are too small to contain more than one emotion at a time, so when Tinker Bell gets jealous of Wendy, it utterly consumes her being.
</li><li> Peter Pan himself comes off as a sociopath due to being raised by Fairies. He can't remember who Wendy and the boys are from day to day, he'll betray and kill his allies to make battles more entertaining, and he's pretty unsympathetic and selfish.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with both Peter and the inhabitants of Avalon in Brom's adaptation of <em>Peter Pan</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChildThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChildThief">The Child Thief</a></em>. Only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">Tanngnost the troll</a> comes off at all sympathetically.
</li><li> The Fairies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElizabethBear">Elizabeth Bear</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrometheanAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrometheanAge">The Promethean Age</a></em> books are, to a one, murderous, untrustworthy, and prone to double-crossing if not properly bound — and those are the <em>sympathetic</em> ones. (Makes sense, as the first book in the series is, among other things, a riff on the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TamLin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TamLin">Tam Lin</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChildBallads">ballad</a>, and Bear enjoys playing with legends and genre tropes.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiderwickChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpiderwickChronicles">The Spiderwick Chronicles</a></em> (by Holly Black and Tony DiTerlizzi) feature a number of fae creatures, along with the ways to deal with them and/or protect oneself from them. Spiderwick's daughter, in her unknowing youth, accepted food from the fae <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and as a result has no desire to eat human food... she would starve to death if the tiny faeries didn't bring her food regularly</span>.
</li><li> Holly Black's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ModernFaerieTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ModernFaerieTales">Modern Faerie Tales</a></em> trilogy fits this trope, but sort of inverts the Seelie/Unseelie dynamic. The fairies are as nasty as any monster, but the higher-ups have slightly reversed roles: the Seelie Queen is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">master of political games</a>, while the Unseelie Queen is straight with her court. That said, the Seelie fairies won't kill you on sight. These books also use the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TamLin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TamLin">Tam Lin</a></em> plotline of a sacrifice every seven years — the Seelie fairies will just spirit away a talented human, while the Unseelie fairies will murder the first person they can find. Interestingly, the Unseelie court is shown to work to the benefit of humanity: as the sacrifice every seven years binds all unaffiliated fairies in Unseelie territory to the Unseelie Queen's rule, it means she can control the Free fae and stop Kelpies and Redcaps and the like murdering people on a daily basis just because they feel like it. One Kelpie specifically says "We, who are not the rulers, we must obey those that are. Mortals are a treat for the Gentry, and not for the likes of you and me. Unless, of course, they are willing."
</li><li> Holly Blacks <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFolkOfTheAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFolkOfTheAir">The Folk of the Air</a></em> plays straight but then later deconstructs this trope. The Folk fit general myths about the fae and are depicted as chaotic, cruel, and willing to prey on the weak. The trope is later deconstructed as the book explores the backstories in faerieland for humans and faeries alike. The book implies that it is the faerie culture, rather than something unique to their species, that perpetuates typical fae behavior. For example, the main character, while human, grew up in faerieland and is indistinguishable from fae personality-wise; shes ruthless, fickle, dishonest, and willing to trick to get ahead. The backstories of faerie teenagers like Cardan and Locke further deconstruct this trope. In the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueenOfNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueenOfNothing">Queen Of Nothing</a></em> prologue, it mentions theres a cultural belief that faerie children dont need to be loved and cared for. However, it is clear that the emotional and physical neglect was severely damaging to Cardan. He acted fickle and impulsive because no adult was around to reign in his behavior, and he acted out as a means to get the attention he was so severely lacking. The culture has a very Might Makes Right attitude, and as he aged he continued to act uncaring, because vulnerability is exploited in their culture. Its easy to see from this micro-case that their culture produces emotionally unavailable adults who pass this culture on to their children.
<ul><li> The fae kidnap humans and use them as enchanted servants. This is because their culture requires human labor to function, but the humans are only kept for a very short time and are paid for their work.
</li></ul></li><li> Emma Bull's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarForTheOaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarForTheOaks">War for the Oaks</a></em> has the Seelie Court and the Unseelie Court. The Seelies are, at the least, tolerant of humans, and usually kind and friendly — as the Fae would define it (The Pouka, who is more familiar with humans than most, does say they have been "unkind" to mortals in the past). They're even capable of falling in love with humans as humans would recognize love. The Unseelies are malicious and nasty, and think nothing of twisting a mere mortal to their ends.
</li><li> The fae in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimButcher">Jim Butcher</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> are like this.
<ul><li> They're split into the Summer (Seelie) and Winter (Unseelie) Courts, ruled over by Queens Titania and Mab respectively. Summer is generally more benevolent, while Winter is more malicious. They're obsessed with obligations — everything, from food and drink to information, has to be traded for, and there is no going back on a deal with the Fae. Accepting gifts from the Fae is a very bad idea, as it means you are in an undefined debt to them, and giving them a gift is seen as a horrible insult. They are very vulnerable to anything with iron in it, and see its use as incredibly cruel. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">Cannot Tell a Lie</a>, but that's <em>far</em> from saying they're truthful; very careful attention needs to be paid to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> when dealing with the fae, since they love <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1z86v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1z86v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1z86v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Changelings also exist, as the children of human-fae pairings: they look human until puberty, when they start developing characteristics similar to their fae side, and generally come to choose to be a faerie or human.</span> Any Fae can also be summoned by speaking its name three times. They will answer the summon, but may not be the happiest of beings to be summoned.
</li><li> Even the Summer Fae have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">rather alien outlook</a> on things like morality.
</li><li> Aurora thought it was a good idea to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">let the Courts destroy one another for the sake of breaking the balance between them, despite the massive destruction and death this would cause, because it would mean the end of fairy meddling in mortal lives forever... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">once there were again such a thing as mortal lives</a></span><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ijzh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ijzh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ijzh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was later revealed Aurora was possessed by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Outsider</a></span>.
</li><li> Titania has no problem <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ordering her soldiers to destroy Dresden even while she is technically indebted to him, purely for the sake of preventing Dresden from saving Marcone on Mab's instructions; from Titania's perspective, if Mab wants Marcone saved, she wants him not to be saved (although there is also the fact that she has little enough love for Dresden in the first place since he killed her daughter, even though she was trying to destroy the Sidhe)</span>. The best way to sum up the Summer morality is that while it can <em>include</em> kindness, it is by no means defined by it.
</li><li> Among the Winter Court... well, sure, the Leanansidhe wants to turn her poor beleaguered godson into a dog, but that's because as far as she's concerned he'd be much safer and happier as one of her hounds than he is at the moment. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero">She might have</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">a valid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">point there</a>) And Maeve once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ordered monsters to attack Chicago</span> as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> because she was worried that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Faerie Courts hadn't moved against the Red Court because of Mab's bizarre behavior</span>, leading to a chain of events that saved a significant portion of the White Council. As Harry says in <em>Changes,</em> "Even in Winter, the cold isnt always bitter, and not every day is cruel."
</li><li> The biggest example of how the courts can defy type: according to the author, the Erlking, leader of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">The Wild Hunt</a>, is Summer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a> is Winter. The one mention of Santa so far says trapping him in a circle is something nobody would ever dare try, but it in no way suggests that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta">Bad Santa</a>. (But it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">makes perfect sense</a> — He's known to be active on December 25th, and the Courts' power shifts with the seasons, after all. The power it would take to be Santa, or to be the reality that Santa is based on... a Summer fae would <em>never</em> have it <em>four days after the winter solstice.</em>) Santa represents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer">generosity in a time of bleakness</a>. Further said, Kringle is Mab's King and Erlking is Titania's King. Within them, they show the traits not often seen in their Queens (Kringle's benevolence against Mab's cold demeanor and Erlking's love of hunt to Titania's compassion.)
<ul><li> <em>Cold Days</em> has shown that Santa Claus is also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">the Norse god</a> Odin</span> and he participates in the Wild Hunt.
</li><li> Also, while the author has referred to them as Kings of Summer and Winter, they are <em>not</em> part of the Courts. They are in no way obligated to follow Mab or Titania. Instead, they're Wyldfae lords of their own domains. There is also Gwynn ap Nudd of the Tylwyth Teg court, a group of Welsh Wyldfae separate from Kringle and Erlking.
</li></ul></li><li> The best way to sum it up might be that style is more important than substance in this case; for example, two fairies come across a hobo, and in a fit of benevolence, decide to help him. One gives him a banquet, a bath, some nice warm clothes, the works. The other harangues him, makes his life hell, and forces him to clean himself up, get a job and stand on his own two feet. In this case, both have made an effort to help him, but the first one would be called to Summer in a time of war, while the other would be headed Winterwards.
</li><li> A bit more insight into the nature of the fae is revealed in <em>Cold Days</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The purpose of the Winter Fae is to fight off incursions by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Outsiders</a>, and without them all reality would be destroyed. The Summer Fae in turn protect reality from Winter.</span>
</li><li> It should also be said that even mortals can become a Fae. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mortal women anyway. If a woman has a heart that is closely aligned to either Summer or Winter and one of the six Queens (Queen Mother, Queen, and Lady) is permanently killed, the mantle could travel into her if one of the Queens of that side is not close or the Queen picks that woman, she will become the new Queen, even if she doesn't want to.</span>
</li><li> On the matter of one's house, in <em>Cold Days</em> it is said the Fae can enter a person's home uninvited. However, they are bound by the laws of Hospitality and so cannot leave the estate in a worse condition than when they entered (Harry's brownie cleaning service entered to clean his untidy home and do laundry many times). Even if they are attacked by the owner of the house, they cannot attack back. The Fae would likely leave and wait until the owner is not protected and then respond to the attack.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em>, fairies are rarely trustworthy. Although they cannot lie, they are masters of evasion. They also have a definite sadistic streak and will ally with good or evil depending on where they think their interests are best served.

A footnote in the book explains that there are two faculties in both men and fairies: a faculty of reason and a faculty of magic. Men possess a greater share of reason than magic, and the fairies are the exact opposite. Though the term "fairy" is used as a convenient catch-all term, the in-universe appendix states that it is an umbrella term that covers many subspecies; by the same token, fairies refer to all humans as "Christians". The book also describes the three classes of supernatural beings — angels, demons and fairies — as being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">eternally good</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">infernally wicked</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">morally suspect</a>" in that order.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnConnolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnConnolly">John Connolly</a>'s short story <em>The New Daughter,</em> a family settle in a house built next to a "fairy fort." The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">hive of fairies imprisoned within</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyelessFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyelessFace">eyeless monsters</a> that attack anyone who sits too close to the roof of their fort; the eldest daughter falls victim to this — they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">bury her alive</a> and replace her with a changeling, who converts the rest of the family and releases them from the fort.
</li><li> The Fair Folk in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBitterbynde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBitterbynde">The Bitterbynde</a></em> trilogy by Cecilia Dart-Thornton for the most part are masters of gramarye (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Functional Magic</a>), beautiful, arrogant, and cruel. Several Faeran characters appeal to the idea that their moral code is merely different to that of mortals, and that they cannot be considered evil. It's not entirely convincing when you hear tales of their awful retribution for meaningless and unintentional "crimes" perpetrated by mortals.
<ul><li> In a twist to this portrayal of the Fair Folk, (the following is a HUGE spoiler, so don't read this if you wish to enjoy the books) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the main character falls in love with the Faeran High King, who is anything but cruel, yet still adheres to the "Our morals are different" mantra when the mortal maiden questions the actions of his kindred</span>.
</li><li> There are other magical beings in the books, collectively called Wights. These fall into the Seelie (benevolent to mankind) and Unseelie (malevolent to mankind) categories, but the Faeran have no such distinction.
</li></ul></li><li> Unsurprisingly, Fairies tend to be pretty unsympathetic in modern day versions of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TamLin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TamLin">Tam Lin</a>", such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PamelaDean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PamelaDean">Pamela Dean</a>'s <em>Tam Lin</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones">Diana Wynne Jones</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FireAndHemlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FireAndHemlock">Fire and Hemlock</a></em>. In Dean's version, the Fairies are described as absolutely alien: "like linear A. They look as if they ought to mean something, but you can't tell what it is."
</li><li> The Fair Folk in Tom Deitz's <em>Tales of David Sullivan</em> are completely unable to comprehend human morality. They have a very strict code of honor, and show signs of honest affection for others, but they are truly immortal — if they are killed, they simply come back. They fight wars out of sheer boredom. This leaves them without any understanding of human death, and thus extremely careless of consequences. They also have very little sense of human social mores: to start with, one of the secondary characters has sex with a selkie, both in humanoid forms and in seal forms. They are very clearly the old gods of Ireland, with all the capriciousness one would expect from having read any Irish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mythology">mythology</a> at all.
</li><li> The Others in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> are a cross between elves, vampires and ice elementals who do far more than merely dabble in snow-sculpture and necromancy; occasionally at the same time (artistically and strategically posed, popsicled and probably still fairly active victims counts). Their very first appearance in the story itself has them toying with, then killing a guy who really can't harm them and laughing at it, then raising him as a wight. The story of the Night's King furthers this. He allegedly chased a woman "with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars" and when he gave her his seed he gave her his soul as well. After this he performed human sacrifice while ruling the Nightfort. It took an alliance between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">the Starks in Winterfell and the King-Beyond-the-Wall</a> to bring them down.
<ul><li> The Children of the Forest are a diminutive, woodland folk with great power over animals, plants (especially weirwood trees), water, stone and memory — at a cost, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a>-style. Although they actively warred with mankind over a long period of history, they eventually made peace before they gradually dwindled away as human civilization swept through the continent in waves, but, their dwindling is also said to be directly linked to the literally earth-shattering feats they pulled using sacrifices, before having to stop to make the almost-forgotten pacts with the First Men. They certainly aren't the Others' brand of bad to know, but they aren't necessarily <em>nice</em>, either.

The ghost in the book was a lonely nerdy boy whom they befriended because he could see them. They told him they would make him able to fly and when he jumps off the school roof they let him fall to his death for their amusement. They don't really understand why he's so mad when he comes back as a ghost. They didn't lie to him, they can actually make him fly and they were doing so but they just decided it would be funny to let him fall.

Both modernizing and explaining in detail a version of the Seelie and Unseelie courts of the sidhe, which are essentially depicted as elemental beings given flesh, or elves (though the idea of their pointed ears is supposedly only true of mixed breeds). Though in Hamilton's world the Sidhe are the ruling race of faerie, there are plenty of brownies, goblins, pixies, and so on. Despite their names, both courts of faerie are shown as having their good sides and bad... namely that while the Seelie sidhe are much more civilized and friendly, they're completely preoccupied with appearances and willingly embracing pretty lies to cover ugly truths, and while the Unseelie sidhe are more comfortable with flagrant sex and torture, they're also more accepting of people or creatures regardless of looks or species, having an official open-door policy for all of Faerie kind. Overall the world of Faerie is expressed as one that's neither good nor bad, but simply primal, from the slaugh ("The nightmares of Faerie kind") to the sidhe.

</li></ul></li><li> Terri Windling's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bordertown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bordertown">Bordertown</a></em> anthologies have a mashup of various fae types. There are elven street gangs, half-elves, fae wannabes, fae-touched, and so on, and their behaviour toward humans varies accordingly. The Bordertown actually exists on the border of genuine, under-the-hill Faerie, and the river running through it is called the Mad River, because to humans one sip is instantaneously addictive and insanity-generating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though it is possible to recover from Mad River addiction — Tick-Tick helped Orient get off the water</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a>'s <em>SERRAted Edge</em> series, and a whole host of other related works, are set in a world where the Seleighe and Unseleighe Sidhe are very real, both dwelling "Underhill", a sort of parallel dimension that is imbued with magic and touches on our world at "Nodes." They were driven there by the increasing preponderance of iron (which is hazardous to them) in the world, but some have adjusted and made a comeback.
<ul><li> Iron also causes their magic to go awry, sometimes shooting off in oh-dear-I-MEANT-straight-not-LEFT directions, although both they and their human allies have analyzed the whys of this effect and come up with clever ways to exploit it. To give some idea of just <em>how</em> thoroughly some have adjusted, the <em>SERRAted Edge</em> series itself is about a bunch of elves who drive race cars made of non-ferrous materials like aluminum and fiberglass.
</li><li> These books <em>very</em> strongly feature the Seleighe/Unseleighe ("good"/"evil") divide among the Fairie. The Unseleighe make a living off evil, feeding off the psychic energy of pain and suffering. They also hold grudges millennia past their expiration dates and believe in returning all ills sevenfold.
</li><li> The Seleighe have a huge soft-spot for children (explained by their own very small birth rate), and many books feature their efforts to protect abused kids, often by kidnapping them from desperate situations to raise as their own Underhill. For all their good qualities, though, even the Seleighe are often portrayed as supercilious, arrogant, and given to pettiness.
</li><li> She also gives an interesting twist to why Sidhe lifestyles are so extravagant and decadent; they are completely incapable of <em>creating</em> anything of their own, instead having to "ken" or copy what they see and assimilate it into their own culture, likely using what they steal to amuse themselves and build an illusion of a glamorous life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu">Don't point out from where they stole their Hammer Horror-style castle throne room design from, though;</a> they get a touch sensitive about being reminded of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPiracyIsEvil">attempted creative infringement</a>.
</li><li> Lackey also touched on this trope in an episode from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLarkAndTheWren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLarkAndTheWren">The Lark and the Wren</a></em>, where Rune has to rescue her Bardic Master/love interest from an Elven king. She succeeds (luckily Elves are vulnerable to music) and forces the king to promise not to come after them or use magic or weapons against them. Sadly Rune isn't quite savvy enough; the enraged king ends up sending a huge-ass thunderstorm (weather being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">neither magical nor strictly a weapon</a>) after them.
</li></ul></li><li> In Julian May's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SagaOfTheExiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SagaOfTheExiles">Saga of the Exiles</a></em> novels, mavericks who don't fit into the galactic utopia of the future are quietly allowed to use a one-way time gate to the Pliocene if they want to opt out. Unfortunately Pliocene Earth is already occupied by the psychic Duat aliens, whose Tanu and Firvulag subraces bear a startling resemblance to the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, and who fled from a utopia of their own so that they could continue their traditions of chivalry and romantic honour by waging an insanely bloodthirsty religious war against each other. The Tanu (seelie) accept psychic humans with the right attitude as their social equals and use mind control to enslave the rest as labourers, breeding stock, or expendable soldiers, while the Firvulag (unseelie) see the Tanu-human partnership as an almost blasphemous break with tradition and want to slaughter all the exiled humans so that their endless war with the Tanu can be fought "cleanly" and with honour. Not exactly nice fairies- and despite appearances, it's by no means clear that the Tanu are any better than the Firvulag.
<ul><li> What makes it even worse is that they're at least partially the direct ancestors of humanity. And the ostensibly "human" Mercy Rosmar, due to the high quota of Tanu genes, is a thorough ball-busting bitch.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance">Jack Vance</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lyonesse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lyonesse">Lyonesse</a></em> deals quite a bit in the fairy world. One character is a human who was raised among fairies and is kicked out to return to humanity when he's an adolescent. Fairies tend to be whimsical, mercurial, and occasionally malicious, but they can be helpful as well under the right circumstances.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MercyThompson">Mercy Thompson</a></em> novels make this very clear in the third book, which features a kelpie that tries to eat Mercy. Plus the Grey Lords who consider killing Mercy for poking into their affairs, and only back off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when they learn that killing Mercy would anger the Marrok and start a war with the werewolves</span>.
</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy">Kushiel's Legacy</a></em> trilogy introduces a human tribe of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Cultures</a> Alba and Eire, who are described <em>very</em> like the Fair Folk: an old people who live in the wild, untamed areas, powerfully magical, and not malicious but adhering to a different moral standard. Some characters fear them and refuse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordPower">speak of them</a>, while others welcome bargaining with them. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Voluntary Shapeshifting</a> and sympathetic magic play a vital role in the plot.
</li><li> The third book in Kate Thompson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Switchers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Switchers">Switchers</a></em> series, <em>Wild Blood</em>, features fairies like these. As the series was intended for children, the fairies aren't <em>too</em> malicious, but there are threats of violence towards the main characters (also children).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU">Tales of MU</a></em>, elves historically fell into this trope and some wild adolescent elves still live there. Faeries exist, too, and are the only thing that badass elven hunter is afraid of (apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">bears</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWolfe">Gene Wolfe</a>'s <em>No Planets Strike</em> has the Beautiful Ones of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledINSPACE">planet Sidhe</a>, who allow unlimited immigration in (supplemented by luring sailors off trading spaceships) but won't allow anyone to leave once there, kill those who try, and horrifically torture those who otherwise run afoul of them.
</li><li> They featured heavily in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance">Chivalric Romance</a>. Such as <em>Sir Orfeo</em>, which starts with the king of Fairy kidnapping Orfeo's wife — although when Orfeo gets a promise out of him, he does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">keep it</a>. They are particularly likely in the earlier ones. Such as Morgan Le Fay (Le Fay = the Fairy), who really was one of the Fair Folk in the oldest romances. The Lady Of the Lake was also a fairy who mutated into an enchantress. Still, they never quite left; the late romance <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SirGawainAndTheGreenKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SirGawainAndTheGreenKnight">Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</a></em> features the Green Knight who is overtly one of the Fair Folk.
<ul><li> In <em>Sir Orfeo</em>, the fairy king takes people at the moment of their death — or possibly after, there was a folkloric tradition of fairies being ghosts — and keeps them in his kingdom as they were then:
<div class="indent"><em>Then he began to gaze about <br/>and saw within the walls a rout <br/>of folk that were thither drawn below <br/>and mourned as dead, but were not so. <br/>For some there stood who had no head, <br/>and some no arms, nor feet; some bled <br/>and through their bodies wounds were set <br/>and some were strangled as they ate, <br/>and some lay raving, chained and bound, <br/>and some in water had been drowned; <br/>and some were withered in the fire, <br/>and some on horse, in war's attire, <br/>and wives there lay in their childbed...</em>
</div></li><li> The fairy mistress was a natural for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtlyLove">Courtly Love</a>, with her magical ability to come and go secretly, and her magical taboos, which played nicely into the spirit of obeying one's lady no matter how capricious she was and how arbitrary her commands were. In some tales, such as <em>Parthenope de Blois</em>, her fairy origin is only hinted but makes the events of the story clear.
</li></ul></li><li> A child's book called <em>Wild Robin</em> plays straight and then subverts this trope. The eponymous Robin runs away from home, falls asleep in a Fairy Ring, and is taken to the Realm of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Faerie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Faerie">Faerie</a>. He enjoys it for a while, then becomes homesick, and one particular fairy teases him. Then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the fairy sees Robin's older sister crying, missing him, feels remorse and tells her the secret way to break the spell and free Robin. She does</span>. Also, that irregular passage of time thing doesn't happen in this book.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarlockOfGramarye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarlockOfGramarye">Warlock of Gramarye</a></em> series by Christopher Stasheff has Fairies who are shaped from Gramarye's native fungus by the unconscious telepathy of the human inhabitants, more-or-less based directly on Medieval English fairly tales and Shakespeare, and Puck and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> Brom, allies of the protagonist, can show a <em>very</em> dark side at times. The first meetings each had with Rod <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">nearly cost him his life</a>. The other Wee Folk only help out on occasion because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gwen and her kids have Fairy blood</span>. They also have an inconsistent relationship with iron.
<ul><li> The Wee Folk of Gramarye also have to be placated; everyone who leaves out milk at night and avoids putting Cold Iron outside their house will be left alone. Those who don't... well, they go through a lot of milk on Gramarye.
</li></ul></li><li> Some short stories and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LiteraturE/TheKingOfElflandsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LiteraturE/TheKingOfElflandsDaughter">The King of Elfland's Daughter</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordDunsany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordDunsany">Lord Dunsany</a> (Anglo-Irish, with a heavy emphasis on the Anglo portion) have elves and similar creatures to whom human life is an incomprehensible mystery. Even after living among humans for many years, they never quite get the hang of it.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars">Council Wars</a></em> series Elves, who are actually a product of genetic engineering, are portrayed as holding themselves apart from humanity, including the eponymous wars except for one, called Bast, who is shown as good if mischievous and she's a different subspecies from the others. It's often hinted that the origin of Elves might be even older than thought and outright said that it's a good thing they hold themselves aloof, because if they ever chose to interfere in human affairs we wouldn't have a chance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Coraline">Coraline</a></em> (again by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>) strongly hints that the Other Mother is one of the Fair Folk, with one of her victims saying her true name is the Beldam (a possible play on <em>La Belle Dame Sans Merci</em>, a poem where a knight is cursed to suffer eternally after having relations with a fairy maiden, although it's also just an archaic word for "witch").
<ul><li> To clear up the <em>Beldam</em> confusion: it appears this word originally signified "an old woman, generally an ugly one". However this word seems to have mutated to, quoting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, "an old woman or creature, particularly an ugly one, believed to be evil and who enjoys child abuse. They are also considered a form of witch that specialize in causing resentment and white lies to give people false impressions like in prophecies or in people's minds." A rather accurate portrait of The Other Mother. Not much to do with faeries, however her hunting methods are reminiscent of those often used by the Fair Folk.
</li><li> This might have to do with Hekkate (goddess of witches) calling the Weird Sisters (old lady witch trio) Beldams in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em>.
</li><li> One of said victims appears to be a nicer sort of fairy — this is only revealed toward the end in the original novel, but due to the necessity of actually portraying them visually, shows up sooner in the Graphic Novel, and was dropped for the film version.

The former aspires to be an angel and tries to do good whilst the latter is amoral at best but both chose to live among humans. Then there is Niall Brigant, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the grandfather to the two and Sookie Stackhouse's great-grandfather</span>, a fairy prince who has a benign but distant regard for humanity yet sees the benefits of tapping into human industries.

What fits them for this trope is that they're quite frankly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">condescending</a> towards humans, calling us '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlur">Mud People</a>'. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">Nobody's really called them out on it</a>... maybe because <em>they're</em> the ones hiding from <em>us</em>, what do they have to be proud of?

</li><li> Despite their relative benevolence, the People still tend to engage in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> regarding "invitations." On the one hand, cries for help are generally accepted as invitations.

</li></ul></li><li> A book called <em>The Changeling</em> deals with this, and with an outcast of their own kind.
</li><li> Melissa Marr's <em>Faerie Court</em> series is made of this trope; her faeries are divided into four courts: Winter, Summer, Dark, and High (with the occasional solitary fae moving freely among the courts). Each court has defining characteristics, but the fae themselves are very much individual people with distinct personalities. Most, to some degree, view humans as inferior; the extent of this can vary, with some seeing them as wayward children and others as expendable playthings.
</li><li> Juliet Marillier's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenwatersTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSevenwatersTrilogy">The Sevenwaters Trilogy</a></em> features Fair Folk based on the ancient legends, and far from cuddly.
</li><li> Carrie Vaughn's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville">Kitty Norville</a></em> series has a brief appearance by a <em>sidhe</em>. Most of the time he looks like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an evangelist</span>, but when the main characters work out some kind of "true seeing" charm, he looks more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind">The Name of the Wind</a></em> features one of these as a boon companion for Kvothe in his "present-day" years. However, at the end of the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he confronts the Chronicler and tells him they both know the truth about the demons roaming the countryside. There are no such things as demons; just very <em>nasty</em> fae</span>. Despite the ominous hints, Bast still clearly cares greatly for Kvothe and seems to have a somewhat compatible sense of right and wrong... his perspective on the world is just very different, and he can be exceedingly selfish. That Bast looks fairly moral to the reader is largely because Bast's selfishness covers his love for Kvothe, so his actions are usually in Kvothe's best interests as well as his own. He shows something of a nastier side in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWiseMansFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWiseMansFear">The Wise Man's Fear</a></em>.
<ul><li> Felurian in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWiseMansFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWiseMansFear">The Wise Man's Fear</a></em> is closer to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairFolk">Fair Folk</a> classic trope. Essentially a leanansidhe or succubus figure, she's a creature of desire, almost like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of seduction. She is described as innocent but caring little for right and wrong; she seduces men who pursue her into Faerie, takes them as lovers, and when she eventually tires of them they die or go insane for wanting to be with her. While sympathetic, something of a mentor figure, and certainly a strange and wondrous being, she is <em>very</em> dangerous, not out of malice but simply out of being so different.
</li><li> And then there's the Cthaeh, which is omniscient and always tells the truth. Problem is it enjoys telling the truth that will hurt the listener the most (it's omniscient so it already knows all of the listener's reactions to anything it says), and that will cause grand-scale disasters. It's regarded with fear even by other fae- they sealed it into a tree in Faerie that's guarded night and day by archers who will shoot anybody who gets close enough to talk to it, and even Felurian, in a rare break from her usual childlike demeanor, reacts with genuine sorrow and concern when she hears that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kvothe</span> encountered it.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WickedLovely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WickedLovely">Wicked Lovely</a></em> series, the main plot of the first book has the main character dealing with being caught in between two faeries and in the other books almost all of the main characters are Fey. They fit very much within this trope. Even the ones that are rather nice don't tend to understand human emotions, some of them are downright cruel, and many have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> going.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeverSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeverSeries">Fever Series</a></em> by Karen Marie Moning the Fae are definitely not cute or charming. At all.
</li><li> Many of the characters in Elizabeth Hand's novel <em>Mortal Love</em> are implied to be Fair Folk. One of the main characters, Larkin, is even referred to directly as "La Belle Dame Sans Merci".
</li><li> <em>The Stolen Child</em> is founded in the myth of the changeling found in European folklore (wherein the Fair Folk/fairies/hobgoblins/sidhe steal a human child and replace it with one of their own). The fairies/hobgoblins of <em>The Stolen Child</em> are not evil, per se (similar to how they are portrayed in Yeats' poem), but they are wild and uncivilized creatures, given to theft, vandalism, all manner of mischief, and stealing human children.

</li><li> Kiersten White's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paranormalcy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Paranormalcy">Paranormalcy</a></em> plays this trope pretty straight. The Seelie Courts are the 'good' ones and the Unseelie are the 'bad' ones and they are all weak to iron and some extent silver... and get drunk on soft drinks. Neither side can resist a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYourTrueName">'Named Command'</a> but both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">twist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">words</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">of</a> the command into something they like and don't obey the same laws as humans (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">"physical, social, emotional, traffic"</a>) and only work towards their own designs. The only difference between the two appears to be that the Unseelie will kill people for no reason, while the Seelie have some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">justification</a>: however neither side appears to have any problem with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> creating prophecies that predict the death of tens of paranormals (possible all of them) and creatures (Evie and Vivian) to carry out these prophecies and steal souls JUST TO SEE WHO WINS</span>!

He thinks the Unseelie are horrible.

</li><li> Used by Paul Kidd in his novelization <em>Descent into the Depths of the Earth</em>, where faeries are ancient, powerful, decadent, insular, isolationist, supremacist, given to truly byzantine machinations to get what they want, and most of them think <em>physical reality</em> is beneath them.
</li><li> Surprisingly for a kid's book, many of the denizens of the Wildworld in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJSmith">L. J. Smith</a> 's <em>The Night of the Solstice</em> fit this to a T.
</li><li> The Hebrew translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> (accidentally?) turned Tolkien's elves into the Fair Folk without actually changing anything in the story. Lacking a real translation for "elf", the older Hebrew versions called them "Shedim" (demons), "Shedonim" (imps or goblins) and perhaps most interestingly, "Bene Lilith" (Children of Lilith/Children of The Night Lady). Nothing about their actions or descriptions was really changed, but somehow simply being called "demons" turned all of their beauty, grace, and (supposed?) niceness sinister and creepy.
<ul><li> Realizing this, a neologism <em>alph</em> (from English "elf") was invented to describe Tolkien's elves in Hebrew.
</li></ul></li><li> The elves in Tolkien´s fiction tend to draw from stories that did not use the fair folk trope, making them morally good to neutral and not particularly alien. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> hints that the woodland elves are somewhat dangerous but they are mostly whimsical and unreliable.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfLostTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfLostTales">The Book of Lost Tales</a></em> has a closer connection to the fair folk, as the first presentation of Melian describes her as a "fay", and the link between Lúthien and hemlocks (a rather poisonous plant associated with witchcraft, for instance in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a>) persists all the way to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Tale of Beren and Lúthien</a></em>, the area between Sauron's fortress and Thingol's realm is the battleground for a gigantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel">Wizard Duel</a> between Melien (Thingol's wife) and Sauron. In that place Sauron's evil spells cause part of the nastiness but Melian's spells tend to keep anyone out Thingol doesn't want in his realm, even allies. They appear like Fair Folk because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">Unfriendly Fire</a> rather than from pleasure for tormenting mortals.
</li><li> In "The Lay of Leithian" Thingol comes off quite like this trope, as he tries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">to wrangle around the oath of neither caging nor killing Beren:</a>
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>'And death,' said Thingol, 'thou shouldst taste,</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>had I not sworn an oath in haste</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>that blade nor chain thy flesh should mar.</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>Yet captive bound by never a bar,</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>unchained, unfettered, shalt thou be</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>in lightless labyrinth endlessly</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>that coils about my halls profound</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>by magic bewildered and enwound;</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>there wandering in hopelessness</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>thou shalt learn the power of Elvenesse!</em>
</div><ul><li> The "Lingerers" as described in <em>Morgoth's Ring</em>, elven spirits are so powerful that their body can't quit hold it and it burns their body away leaving them in a shadowy form. The "Unbodied" are elves that actually died and refused to obey Mandos's summons. Some of these had actually worked for Morgoth. These are the ones to fear while Lingerers are generally nice if strange and unpredictable. These perhaps correspond to the Seelie and the Unseelie.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmithOfWoottonMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmithOfWoottonMajor">Smith of Wootton Major</a></em>, they are hinted at. Smith is protected from them, but aware of their existence in Faerie.
</li><li> Ever if the elves of the Tolkien legendarium don't follow the trope, it is at least invoked, and seems to be pervasive in the human lands by the end of the Third Age, both people having become estranged, even in Gondor.
</li></ul><div class="indent">'By strange paths has this company been led, and so far to evil fortune. Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria, to our loss. And now we must enter the Golden Wood, you say, but of that perilous land we have heard in Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in, and of that few none have escaped unscathed.' (Boromir)
</div><div class="indent">'Then there is a Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales tell!' he said. '-Few escape her nets, they say. These are strange days! But if you have her favour, then you also are net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.' (Eomer)
</div></li><li> Althought the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">elves</a> are more similar to the Tolkien version, the elves in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> nonetheless have traits similar to this. Elves are immortal and magical creatures and though they're mostly good guys it's outright stated that they are haughty, arrogant, twist the truth around and are constantly plotting.
<ul><li> They're also capable of changing their physical form, and many are described as looking very alien and inhuman.
</li><li> At one point in the saga, Arya also mentions an in-universe false common belief that they kidnap human babies, leaving an evil doppelganger in their place, a belief she's not very pleased about.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/SlavicMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/SlavicMythology">Veela</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> are all beautiful and alluring creatures whose dancing exerts a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">mind control</a> over the men who watch them. When angered they transform into birdlike, taloned creatures and throw balls of light.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">goblins</a> are described as cunning and ruthless and their sense of morality is different from ours. For example, in the first book when Harry visits the wizard bank, the goblins who run it say that anyone who tries to break into a vault will be sucked inside and trapped. The goblin smiles and says that they only check the vaults for would be thieves every few years.
</li><li> As for actual fairies in this series, it's averted: in this setting, while they look like tiny winged humanoids and use a form of (very weak) magic, they're only about as intelligent as insects (they metamorphose and lay eggs like insects do) and are treated like household pests. Occasionally they're even used as decorations (which is a pun on "fairy lights", the British term for Christmas lights).
</li><li> The HP Universe does contain some rather nasty fairy-like creatures, however, in the form of Bowtruckles and Doxies. Bowtruckles live in wand wood trees and tend to gouge people's eyes out if they try to cut wood from them (unless they get offered woodlice or fairy eggs in exchange). Doxies are nicknamed "The Biting Fairy" and are little black pests with two sets of teeth.
</li><li> Pixies are small, winged humanoids, who seem to amuse themselves by causing mischief.
</li><li> Witches and Wizards actually fit the definition quite closely: they're a parallel society of magical beings who live by different laws, and often, different morals, to ordinary humans 'muggles'. In fact, they are effectively a law unto themselves. As for their treatment of 'muggles', even the nicest tend towards a kind of benevolent condescension, while others treat them with contempt, and others still treat as dim animals to be hunted for fun, and all regard them with a buried fear. They conceal themselves by, and specialise in, enchantments that manipulate the perceptions and alter the memories of those humans they encounter. Their court is under the earth, inaccessible to ordinary mortals. Reality around their older dwellings can be a bit strange — Hogwarts, for instance, is an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">Eldritch Location</a>. They whisk children (magical children, admittedly) off to their world, from which they often never return — and if they do, it is often very different to how they left. And the nastier examples of their kind toy with, torture, hunt, and kill 'muggles' for fun. Hell, Harry himself even fits as a variation on the changeling myth: an otherworldly child left with a human couple to raise, one they <em>know</em> isn't human, who they simultaneously hate and fear, around whom increasingly weird things happen, and then who is eventually claimed by his people from their secret magical land.
</li></ul></li><li> The fairies in <em>Poison</em> fit this perfectly. The whole plot is set in motion by one of them kidnapping the heroine's sister.
</li><li> A mostly benign version appears in Lloyd Alexander's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfPrydain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfPrydain">The Chronicles of Prydain</a></em>.

He's extremely unscrupulous about means.
</li><li> Dennis L. McKiernan likes to demonstrate his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">knowledge</a> of fairy lore in his Mithgar series as well as his Faery series.
</li><li> Invoked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FatherBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FatherBrown">Father Brown</a></em> story "The Sins of Prince Saradine":
<div class="indent"><em>"By Jove!" said Flambeau, "it's like being in fairyland." <br/>Father Brown sat bolt upright in the boat and crossed himself. His movement was so abrupt that his friend asked him, with a mild stare, what was the matter. <br/>"The people who wrote the mediaeval ballads," answered the priest, "knew more about fairies than you do. It isn't only nice things that happen in fairyland." <br/>"Oh, bosh!" said Flambeau. "Only nice things could happen under such an innocent moon. I am for pushing on now and seeing what does really come. We may die and rot before we ever see again such a moon or such a mood." <br/>"All right," said Father Brown. "I never said it was always wrong to enter fairyland. I only said it was always dangerous."</em>
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OctoberDaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OctoberDaye">October Daye</a></em> series, the fair folk vary in how close they are to classic descriptions of the fair folk (some of them able to pass for average humans in most situations). The closer a fairy's heritage is to Oberon, Maeve, and Titania (the progenitors of faerie), or the stronger the differences between strains of mixed magical heritage, the more likely they are to resemble the classical fair folk, as well as certain races such as the Cait Sidhe (which seem like Fair Folk even to the more human-like fair folk). Blind Michael (one of the Firstborn, a son of Oberon) in particular reads like he was lifted straight out of a blender full of three-hundred-year-old fairy legends, and was said to be the inspiration for a number of child-stealing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">Wild Hunt</a> legends.

They're vulnerable to bluntness and crudity-you can't kill them with a well-made cold-iron sword, but an iron pipe will probably do the trick, as bluntness offends them on a fundamental level and leaves them vulnerable, allowing you to penetrate their Glamour defenses.

<ul><li> Traditional elf folklore has a grain of truth to it, but it's been badly misinterpreted, filtered through medieval monks recording word-of-mouth from terrified peasants who barely got a glimpse of their captors. Don't bother with cold iron; it's resistant to a few of their weapons, but nothing else — they wear full plate armor without problems.

<ul><li> <em>The Stolen Child</em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamButlerYeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamButlerYeats">William Butler Yeats</a>, is about a child lead away by the fairies. The fairies here are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil">Ambiguously Evil</a>; while they believe they are doing the child a favor, as it's implied that he's unhappy (although he might just be overwhelmed by the misery around him), they show no sign of telling his parents or family that he's alright.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheErlKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheErlKing">Erlkönig</a></em>, along a very similar theme to the above. In this poem the "Erl-King" is a Faerie creature who wants a boy he finds pretty to come with him, but when the boy refuses, he seizes the boy's soul by force, killing him (though an alternative interpretation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">holds that the ill boy was feverishly hallucinating</a>). The name <em>Erlkönig</em> is often anglicized as Erl-King or Alder-King, but it is ultimately a corruption of the Danish <em>ellerkonge</em>, which in fact means Elf-King.
</li><li> A topical complement (and historically the inspiration) to <em>Erlkönig</em> is <em>Herr Oluf</em> (alternately titled <em>Erlkönig's Daughter</em>), another German ballad inspired by Danish folklore, by Goethe's contemporary Johann Herder. A young bridegroom is riding around to invite the guests for his wedding the other day, when he meets the elves. The Elf-Queen asks him to dance with her. When he adamantly refuses, she curses him with a sickness. Next morning, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">he's dead.</a>
</li><li> On the surface William Allingham's "The Fairies" <em>appears</em> to portray them as endearing:
<div class="indent"><em>Up the airy mountain, <br/>Down the rushy glen, <br/>We daren't go a-hunting <br/>For fear of little men.</em>
</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd> However he then emphasizes that they're anything but, abducting a little girl for seven years who then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByDespair">dies of sorrow</a>, and putting thorns in humans' beds to punish them for interfering with their trees.
</dd></dl><ul><li> Christina Rossetti's poem, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoblinMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoblinMarket">Goblin Market</a>", is about a girl who starves herself after giving in to temptation and eating fairy food.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s "The Fairy Reel" is about a man with whom a fairy girl has fallen in love.

He enjoys his stay there, but learns that every seventh year, the elves have to pay a "tithe [tax] to Hell". Fearing he himself will be the tithe, he flees. The Queen denies that she would have offered Tam Lin, but that still seems to imply the elves regularly sacrifice one of their own to the Devil.

They don't typically have driving motivations so much as drives they adopt because they seem dramatically appropriate, and would like to see Creation as a whole dissolve into the Wyld because the very concept of something operating by logic and physical laws disgusts them, since their own world operaes purely on narratives and tropes instead.
<ul><li> Well, not always.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> paints Fairies as powerful incomprehensible alien entities that regularly abduct humans and take them off to their homeland, where they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryTransformation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryTransformation">warped</a> to fit their masters' perceptions of them. The Changelings of the title are humans who've managed to escape back to Earth, but who've been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome">changed</a> by their time in the world of Faerie and are trying to avoid their former captors at all costs. Notably, <em>Changeling</em> also directly correlates the modern concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienAbduction">Alien Abduction</a> with the Fae, explicitly invoking such standbys as lights in the sky, strange experiments, and Keepers taking the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenMen">Little Green Men</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a> in a number of places. It is later explained that the True Fae need conflict to prevent themselves fading away into the random background chaos of Arcadia. As a result, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">the closest thing they have to friends among other Fae are their sworn enemies, as by fighting they're keeping each other alive</a>. They can also be inanimate objects (Props), legions of lesser beings (Wisp), and entire self-enclosed universes (Realms) in addition to their normal forms (Actors). With enough Titles, they can do the aforementioned simultaneously!
</li><li> This is in marked contrast to the earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming">Changeling: The Dreaming</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> Changelings are actual (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-</a>)Faeries using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityEnsues">human disguises</a> to protect themselves from Disbelief, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a>.
<ul><li> Though the Kithain are fae souls shaped by human experiences, some — especially the Redcaps and Sluagh, and the Sidhe of both Courts just after their return to the Tellurian — are often chillingly inhuman and capricious, at least when played right. Some sub-groups — the Sidhe's House Leanhaun, for example — are specifically meant to reflect the more traditional view of The Good People as rapacious and unsympathetic to their mortal victims.
</li><li> <em>Dreaming</em> also has other types of fae with even less connection to humanity: Thallain are essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterparts</a> to the Kithain, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> and given to monstrous practices by inclination. The inanimae are fae spirits bound to the elements who find the mysteries of fleshy existence deeply puzzling (they call said mysteries the "Heart Riddle", and have spent centuries trying to figure them out). The adhene are fae who were barred from Earth a very long time ago, only now finally able to return thanks to various supernatural cataclysms, and can be often even more inhuman and capricious than the Kithain.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Dark Ages: Fae</em>, another White Wolf game which is "officially" considered to be a prequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming">Changeling: The Dreaming</a></em>, but is so radically different it can also be run as a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>. In it fairies are divided into the Firstborn, who are true fae without need for that pesky mortal shell; Inanimae, beings whose bodies are based on natural elements, as well as artificial constructs; and Changelings, who in this setting are different from both the above, being human children spirited away and raised as faeries, faerie children raised in the human world, or true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrids">Half-Human Hybrids</a>. The fae are divided into 5 courts based around their preferred powers and attitude towards humans. All four of the primary courts, the fifth simply being the neutral group, quite easily come across as this trope. It's been remarked that the difference between good and evil faeries isn't over whether they <em>should</em> rule over humans, but rather how they should go about it. The Spring Court wants to learn about "modern" humanity and use that knowledge to revive the fear and reverence that they once received. The Summer are the harsh traditionalists, and intend to punish humans for breaking their ancient, and forgotten, oaths, and restore the old order. The Autumn Court, like the Spring, wish to learn more about humans and work with them; however rather then outright respect they wish to manipulate the course of history from behind the scenes. Finally is the Winter Court, which isn't actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, but they do their best to appear so to humanity. The fact that characters tend to have very alien and unique systems of morality is one of the game's major themes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>:
<ul><li> Elves often fit this role in those world where they're portrayed less as another mortal race and more as amoral, reclusive wardens of the forests.
<ul><li> The elves of Lorwyn set are horned and hooved, supposedly to remind you of deer and satyrs, but... they are also aristocratic, ruthless, and predatory, and have built a society with castes based on cunning and physical attractiveness. The Castes range from Faultless, Immaculate, Exquisite, to Perfect, the top of the pack. Eyeblights, which includes non-Elves as well as ugly or disfigured Elves, are scum and can (or must) be killed.
</li><li> In most <em>Magic</em> sets, Elf creatures are very Tolkien-sian. A bit more xenophobic, but Tolkien's elves could be pretty xenophobic to anyone who wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> too. They're still creatures of order and "live and let live", as shown by the fact that (until the Lorwyn block) the color of mana they are most likely to use, after green, is white. Lorwyn, though, is consciously based on faerie tales, so the predatory, capricious and aristocratic aspects of the Fair Folk got emphasized, and for the duration of the block elves were black secondarily to green instead of white. A tribe switching colors is rare, and switching to a rival color like that is almost unheard of.
</li><li> Flavor text for the original Llanowar Elves from Alpha: "One bone broken for every twig snapped under foot." Pretty brutal for 1/1 druids that give you green mana.
</li></ul></li><li> The expansion <em>Throne of Eldraine</em> is based off the original Grimm tales, so this is inevitable. All of the nonhuman species (elves, goblins, giants, etc.) live in the vast woods outside of humanity's kingdom. Travelers in said woods need to be wary, as the bridges might not lead to the other side of the same river- or even the same time. The local goblins are called redcaps, and they have their namesake's method of dying them. Morality-wise, they practice their own versions of the color-related values the kingdoms hold. For example, the Green-aligned Garenbrig seeks to use their strength to protect the weak, but the Green giants wish to be strong for the sake of strength and do not understand why anyone wouldn't. Even the relatively-benign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyGodmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyGodmother">White-Aligned faeries</a> are prone to meddling.
</li><li> Naturally enough, fairies have also been portrayed as this in various sets.
<ul><li> The Faeries of Lorwyn are very mischievous and disrupting, if not outright evil. In Lorwyn/Morningtide they were simply mischievous troublemakers, but became outright evil in Shadowmoor/Eventide. In truth, the faeries are not truly different in the two sets: while the rest of Lorwyn-Shadowmoor cycles from a light, pleasant world to a dark and evil one every few centuries, Oona's magic protects her faeries from the cycling's effects. They really <em>are</em> little evil bastards, but while the rest of the plane is in its Lorwyn phase, they tone it down. In fact, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> for that block was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Oona, Queen of the Fae</span>. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">exceptionally overpowered</a>.
</li><li> This isn't altogether limited to Lorwyn, although the "fairy tale" nature of the setting certainly emphasized the various creatures' relevant traits. While <em>Magic</em>'s faeries may be the small winged pixie type in general, well, see the flavor text on <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=171">Scryb Sprites<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> if you think they're in any way, shape, or form harmless.

</li><li> In more recent cosmology, the Seelie Court, ruled by Queen Titania, are often shown arrogant elitists who refuse to consider non-Fey people.

</li><li> While elves are often described as being close to nature and the fey, they are still typed as humanoids; fey has its own type, and includes a very wide array of very strange creatures. In 4E, you may notice that there's not a single good-aligned fey among them...

The Eladrin were given the fey-subtype and elevated to the position of masters of the Feywild (4e's Faerie). The Seelie and Unseelie courts can be found in The Manual of the Planes supplement as the Summer and Winter courts respectively, as well as several other courts.
</li><li> In 4E, you can play a warlock who's sworn fealty to The Fair Folk (or at least got them bent over a log).

</li><li> Grain nymphs (first appearing in the Dragonlance setting) can go either way. Usually benevolent to humans (and looked down upon by their kin as city-slicker snobs) their presence can <em>double</em> a farm's harvest, giving plentiful bounty to whatever community it feeds, but woe betide a farmer who tries to exploit or hurt a grain nymph; not only will it drive her away, she "marks" the transgressor so that farm animals (including horses) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsHateHim">regard him as an enemy</a>, <em>forever</em>.
</li><li> The Shadow World makes use of the Seelie and Unseelie Court concepts. The Unseelie are as vile and bloodthirsty as you'd expect, but the Seelie can also be very dangerous due to how alien their mindset is. They don't think twice about kidnapping human children like puppies who caught their eye — they tend not to see humans as people. Changeling "pets" see good care, though, and can fend for themselves (even in the Shadow World) by the time they aren't that cute and the Seelie sends them away.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a>, the Arak or "shadow fey" range from meddlesome to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> in temperament, and don't limit themselves to stealing infants: if you have a talent or skill that appeals to them, they can sever your shadow, reducing you to a soulless automaton going through the motions. Your shadow becomes a construct that'll compliantly work for them forever. Even Good-aligned Arak insist they're <em>doing them a favor</em> when they practice this technique on mortals.
</li><li> Even the conventional "sylvan fey" of the Land of Mists can be nastier than elsewhere, due to the ambient influence of the Dark Powers throughout the setting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> used to have few true fairies, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CounselorsAndKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CounselorsAndKings">Counselors and Kings</a></em> Unseelie are presented as one of the very few things that can truly scare Drow, as opposed to irritate them or cause to back off for now.
</li><li> Some fairies get along with others well, but still are fairly weird. The trio of Glouras (cute singing Underdark sprites with mothlike wings) runs a festhall in Sshamath, a de-facto dancing club and concert hall known even to many human bards on the surface. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideStoryBonusArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideStoryBonusArt">spin-a-yarn</a>, the Bloody Fist tavern (Waterdeep) has as barmaids and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairySexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairySexy">sort of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">Fanservice</a> "the Laughing Sisters", named so because they always giggle, who like to bite people's ears just for the sweet taste of blood. <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/mirrorstone/Article.aspx?doc=fr_spinayarn2004main">They help<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to deal with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl">problem customers</a>" too.
</li><li> Fourth Edition also has <em>Heroes Of The Feywild</em> which goes in-depth into the home dimension of the fae, from the perspective of both mortal visitors and locals. It also details the various courts, all of which often fit this trope, but especially the Winter Court, which follows a fae prince who is the living embodiment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">Love Makes You Evil</a>. It also introduces Pixies as a PC race.
</li><li> An older oft-remembered Fey that looks like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTreesAttack">tree</a>, the Murderjack. They're a case of fluff matching crunch really well, in that they're fully capable of (literally) ripping apart an unprepared party. Murderjacks hunt in packs, strip the skin from your flesh, and heal you when you stop moving (to prolong your agony). They're also described by many players as "essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/XMeetsY">Tree-</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSlenderManMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSlenderManMythos">Slenderman</a>".
</li><li> It's also worth noting that most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch">hags</a> are classified as Fey.
</li><li> In 5e, Warlocks can make pacts with Archfeys. This pact allows Warlocks access to some whimsical and mind effecting spells like Sleep, Calm Emotions, Phantasmal Force, Blink, and Dominate Person.

Of the few Elves that do leave their homeland, a fair proportion are assassins who have dedicated their lives to hunting down and killing human wizards and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">mechanika</a>-users. They do this because they believe that human arcane magic and mechanika are draining the life from their last remaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, thereby dooming the Elven race to extinction; whether or not this is actually the case has never been conclusively addressed. To say nothing of the Nyssian Elves, who are enslaved body and mind to a monster.

<ul><li> Unlike the elves in <em>D&amp;D</em>, the game <em>Pathfinder</em> is based on, it is is the <em>gnomes</em> who are the Fey-connected people with a more alien perspective on things. They originate from the spirit world, being in essence fairies who were exiled to the material world after a disaster and "went native". They're constantly seeking new experiences to avoid the Bleaching, a process where they're literally <em>bored to death</em> and turn to dust and bones. It's hinted that the story of the disaster may be a fabrication, and gnomes are really humanoid interface devices through which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">vastly more powerful beings</a> can study the material world.

They are immensely powerful but very fickle, and their presence is a double-edged blessing for those living in their lands. Glaistigs take under their protection vast territories of wilderness and rural land, and the people living in their territories enjoy their protection from outside threats and natural calamites such as droughts and blights in exchange for gifts of food, drink and craft. If a glaistig is offended, however — and they are easily offended, by anything from lack of proper appeasement to being told any sort of lie — she can and will scourge the land with hexes, curses and blights, and her presence alone is enough to incite people into frenzied, uncontrollable dancing.

<ul><li> The Dark Eldar, in spades. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">According to 5th Edition Dark Eldar codex writer Phil Kelly</a>, the Dark Eldar were designed with a "faerie-tale elves" look and feel, and it shows; wild hunts on defenceless human cities and worlds to snatch captives, mirrors that shatter and kill the people they're reflecting, witch-like Haemonculi covens that make deals in abstract payments such as your ability to laugh. The fourth Chaos god of excess, Slaanesh (a god that rewards and delights in endless rape and torture)? It was birthed by the Eldar's distant ancestors' incessant hedonism... and the Dark Eldar <em>exceed them</em>. The Dark Eldar are beautiful, soulless horrors, exactly like the fey folk of old. One character in a Dark Eldar codex passage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">explicitly refers to them as such</a>.
<div class="indent">Malko stumbled backwards, remembering the stories Goodwife Ingrid used to tell him as a child: grisly tales of a changeling folk who came from the skies to steal the innocent away into hell.
</div></li><li> Their "good" cousins, the Craftworld Eldar, are little better. Fulfilling the classic stereotype of fairies and elves manipulating humans with little regard for their well-being, the Eldar once diverted an Ork invasion towards the human Hive world of Armageddon and instigated a war which left <em>millions</em> dead and most of the planet in ruins, to save a Craftworld with only 10,000 Eldar living on it. That said, the Eldar can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">possibly justify this atrocity</a> by the fact that A) they're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">Dying Race</a>, and B) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">the Imperium would certainly do the same to an Eldar Craftworld if the situation were reversed</a>.

</li><li> The Exodite Eldar are slightly better, but only because there's little background on them. They're basically hippies living the way they did before Slaanesh came along (see Dark Eldar). This being 40K, "hippies" means that they ride giant psychically-attuned dinosaurs into battle.
</li><li> And the scary thing is that the Craftworld Eldar and Harlequins are considered to be the closest thing the setting has to a <em>"good guy"</em>, besides <em>maybe</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">Tau</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">Empire</a>, depending on your interpretation of them. This speaks volumes about the rest of the galaxy's inhabitants.
</li><li> The Dark Angels chapter has the Watchers in the Dark, diminuitive creatures who are always obscured by their robes. Though some of them serve the Dark Angels in some minor capacity, what little is revealed about them in the backstory (most notably the Horus Heresy novels <em>Fallen Angels</em> and <em>Descent of Angels</em> makes it clear they hold a lot more cards regarding the fate of the sons of Caliban than they let on.

<ul><li> The Wood Elves are extremely xenophobic and generally act more like a force of nature than a civilized people. This is especially true with their king, Orion the Hunter, who every spring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">goes on a rampage around the woods and nearby area</a> with a host of spirits and wild hunters. The Wood Elves also have a habit of capturing human children from the nearby land of Bretonnia, who become their ageless servants. It is entirely possible that they are running Bretonnia's religion as well.
</li><li> Dark Elves are slightly less torture-happy than their 40K equivalents (though they're opposite to the High Elves: Khaine, the High Elf god of War, is their god of murder) who were exiled to what is basically Canada, living as raiders, capturing wild animals to use them in battle.
</li><li> High Elves are perhaps an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a>. True, a good number of them are majorly stuck-up assholes, but some of them are decent enough people.

And overall, they can be somewhat reasoned with and they have the world's safety in mind.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureSpirit">Dryads</a> normally look like beautiful human or eleven women... up until someone threatens the forest, or unknowingly breaks some obscure rule, or even just catches them in a bad mood, at which point they transform in monstrous humanoids made of wood and bring remorseless, violent retribution on whoever was unlucky enough to find them. And sometimes they deliberately use their beautiful forms to lure people into the forest to hunt them for sport.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Treants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Treants">Treemen</a>, at least, are direct in their motivations: leave the forest be, and they'll happily ignore you. Break off so much as a single branch, and you die.

They are mercurial shapeshifters known for their emotional natures and cruel sense of humor — sometimes they'll simply be mischievous or even helpful, sometimes they'll fly into rages due to some obscure or unintentional insult, sometimes they'll play cruel, spiteful tricks on or just abandon their own allies for no discernible reason.

The Unseelie are treated as horrifying monsters, but even the Seelie (sometimes called "The Goodly Folk") are regarded with fear and suspicion. The Seelie do not have normal emotions, and because of this, some of them take pleasure in emotionally manipulating humans. They will often torment humans for their own purposes or entertainment, and the Queen of the Sky is known to participate in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">The Wild Hunt</a>.

Even nice fairies, though, are apt to feed you enchanted food with unpleasant results. The continuity also has the Splugorth, low level cosmic entities who employ magic-resistant species to rob the fae and put them into mystical weaponry.
</li><li> The Scalders in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonDice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonDice">Dragon Dice</a></em> are the remnants of the fae people, stranded after the bulk of their species shut themselves off from the world to avoid the horrors of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> that the setting is engaged in. Instead of giving up, the Scalders found that there was a whole lot of fun to be had in a warring world — there were plenty of things (and people) to burn or drown, as the race is comprised of elemental fire and water.
</li><li> The Fae are... generally decent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em> (at least the Irish ones), but they have their rules, and if you break them, it's your <em>ass</em>. The Erl-king (mentioned above) shows up as well, and is a fairly powerful, nasty sort.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Nobilis</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Nobles</a> deliberately evoke this trope. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> seek to unmake reality by twisting seemingly mundane events, so Noble behavior will seem bizarre to ordinary people. Nobles may spend months convincing a random mortal they own a cat, or kill someone because they bought a yellow SUV, and reality itself may very well hinge upon their success.
<ul><li> Some Nobles actually <em>are</em> fae in origin — the third edition Power of Silver, for example, is of Daoine Sidhe extraction.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nobilis spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChuubosMarvelousWishGrantingEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChuubosMarvelousWishGrantingEngine">Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine</a></em> has the Creature of Fable path, which turns <em>the PC</em> into something like this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> has various setting featuring this sort of fairy:

The typical Fairy Queen detailed in the book certainly does, being Callous, Jealous, and Selfish.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica">Ars Magica</a></em>, The Oath of Hermes, the pledge all mages must take if they wish to join the Order of Hermes (and not get hunted down by said order for practicing unapproved magic), contains a specific phrase: "I shall not molest the Fae." Understand, this is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica">Ars Magica</a>,</em> which isn't exactly lacking in all sorts of nifty demons, monsters, and crazy magic-users to make life more exciting. No, it's The Fair Folk that get singled out: all those other monsters will kill you, or even torment you, but the Fae like to get <em>creative</em> and play with you first.
<ul><li> Although the Code does specifically prohibit dealings with the Infernal, it's usually because there's just no way to win against Demons and that kind of thing breeds diabolism (and ends up being what got House Tytalus in trouble), but they tell you <em>do not molest the Fae</em> because although they <em>can</em> be dealt with fairly and can even have good relationships with other denizens of Mythic Europe (as House Merinita can attest), <em>they do not forget being slighted, ever</em>, and they <em>will</em> carry grudges, and they have <em>very</em> creative ways of expressing them. The (usually high-point-value) Flaw "Faerie Enmity" can be taken without actually providing a specific reason: your <em>great-great-grandfather</em> you never even met might've offended some faerie at some point and that's the only reason they need.
</li><li> It's specifically noted that the Fae are incapable of true evil, being soulless and untouched by original sin; they find the thought of genuine malice alien and horrible. Rather, their caprices are the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, since their culture is a badly warped imitation of humanity at best and completely alien at worst. One gamebook has a villager mention killing a hideous changeling that had been left in place of one of the women's babies, at which time an old crone lurking in the shadows mutters in disgust that they would have traded the brat back if they'd known the mother was unhappy with the bargain.

Now all fairies are more busy trying to rip each other apart so they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">have some lunch</a>.

Like the series' demons, they're made up of information strung together through an electromagnetic field, explaining why iron messes them up so badly; similarly, it's said they appear rarely in modern Britain, given how the nation is wired to the gills. They do take children, however, and changelings are explained away as a class four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">Glamour</a> placed over a poppet made of twigs and string to make it look like it's a real child. And the kids? They're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WetwareCPU">turned into biological computation matrices</a> in order to sustain a field that will keep the faerie in our world.

The setting is drawn in very broad strokes, though, meaning that further comparison of ghosts and fairies is really up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld">Bleak World</a></em>: The Elves (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">who might just be Venusians or the Court of Roses</a>) kicked the Jotun off of their homeworld and killed a good majority of them in the process.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikIbsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikIbsen">Henrik Ibsen</a> re-used the Shakesperean plot in one of his early plays: <em>St. John´s Eve</em> presents the elves as benign woodland creatures, mostly written as a part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>.
</li><li> Norwegian poet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikWergeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikWergeland">Henrik Wergeland</a> used elves as henchmen for the good guys in some of his more farcical plays. In one of his later plays, the fair folk trope is played straight, as the <em>hulder</em> herself abducts the titular character into the mountain to make him do the dirty work for her (This Hulder is plain evil). The abduction trope is subverted as the hulder´s daughter is lured out of the mountain by a young poet, and the fair folk wants him dead for it.

All exhibit some qualities as a race that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">bizarre or plain alien</a> to human sensibilities, and frequently clash with the races of men (and perhaps just as frequently, with <em>each other</em>). The extinct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">Dwemer</a> are probably the straightest example, with contemporary sources and modern researchers alike painting them as mysterious with abilities well beyond what any other race on Tamriel could compare with.

All are pre-creation spirits ("et'Ada") who made no sacrifices during the creation of Mundus, the mortal plane, and thus retain their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a>. The 17 most powerful and prominent Daedric spirits are the Daedric Princes, each of whom has a particular sphere, which the are said to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">embody</a> and govern from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">their planes</a> of Oblivion which they inhabit and rule. While the vast majority of the Daedra are seen as wholly evil by most mortals, they are technically beings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">Above Good and Evil</a> who operate on their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> aligned with the spheres over which they govern.

</li><li> A number of other species exist in Nirn who qualify. To note:
<ul><li> Spriggans are a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople">tree spirits</a> who typically take the basic form of tall, humanoid females made of wood. They are revered as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">Nature's Guardians</a>" and are associated with Kynareth, one of the Nine Divines and goddess of the heavens, winds, and elements. Despite this reverence, Spriggans are usually hostile toward any trespassers in their domain.
</li><li> Nymphs are a type of nature spirit most commonly found in the Iliac Bay region. They take the form of beautiful, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullFrontalAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullFrontalAssault">naked</a>, long-haired women and attack using mystical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire spells</a>. Though rumored to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual">highly sexual beings</a>, most are rather shy and rarely approach mortals on their own.
</li><li> The Hist are a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">ancient</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseTree">sentient</a>, giant spore-trees native to Black Marsh. They are worshiped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonians</a> who drink the sap of the Hist to grow, and can communicate with the Hist via visions transmitted in the sap. It is said that the Hist were the original inhabitants of Tamriel, and that they were originally from one of the 12 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreationMyth">"worlds of Creation"</a> that were shattered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAntiGod">Padomay</a> and then coalesced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfGods">Anu</a> to create Nirn.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Red Caps of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> recalls one of the truly nasty varieties of the original Faeries. Their entire reason for being is to torture and torment others in creative ways — their caps were red because they had been <em>dipped in human blood</em>. True to form, they're also extremely dangerous for their level (despite being really, really short).
<ul><li> The zone of Croatoa, where the Red Caps run fierce, also has the Fir Bolg, weird pumpkin-headed scarecrows, and the Tuatha de Danaan, who aren't so much the Celtic gods as, well, "wookie moose." And then there are the black sprites that hover around Eochai (the Giant Monster of the Fir Bolg) during the Halloween event, which are called The Unseelie.
</li><li> It is revealed that the Fir Bolg and Tuatha de Danaan are ancient enemies of the Red Caps, who transformed them into those odd forms to torment them even more.
</li><li> This trope is referenced by Justin Augustine at the beginning of his Task Force: "Far out in the center of this region is a place called the Chantry. It's supposed to hold all kinds of vast and ancient secrets, including a powerful being the natives only refer to as 'The Kind One'. Now, a title like that can mean a lot of things in folklore, like trying to placate something monstrous." (Though Faathim the Kind does actually live up to his name, and has a Task Force of his own.)
</li></ul></li><li> The pixie Hellions in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria">Tales of Zestiria</a>. In Edna's words "Earth-dwellers seem to think they're benevolent. That's cute."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlIITheUrQuanMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlIITheUrQuanMasters">Star Control II: The Ur-Quan Masters</a></em> portrays the Arilou Lalee'lay as patronizing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenMen">Little Green Men</a> who were behind the myths of The Fair Folk, and fit the trope as enigmatic allies with "plans" for humanity.
</li><li> Every encounter with fairy folk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakengard">Drakengard</a></em> is laden with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">contempt for humans</a>. This trope is most exemplified in the case of Leonard though, as his pact-partner is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallAnnoyingCreature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallAnnoyingCreature">a malicious fairy</a> who bonded with him seemingly only for the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">torturing him</a> over his inability to kill himself. Which backfired magnificently when Leonard found the inner strength to perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to slow down the Grotesqueries and as a bonus dragged the insufferable thing with him as it desperately tried to escape its impending doom.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em> games, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a>, there are Fairies and Elves around too. And while they're certainly both cute and pretty, that doesn't mean they won't kill you just for being there.
<ul><li> Or if you're a pretty Japanese boy, they may just simply kidnap you to be their pet, regardless that you're trying to save the world — which happens to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Raidou</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidouKuzunohaVsKingAbaddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaidouKuzunohaVsKingAbaddon">Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon</a></em> in a side quest.
</li><li> Or Puck could side with your rival who tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovePotion">Love Potion</a> you to abandon the quest, but accidentally <em>get</em> your female party member (the funniest scenes ensue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiII">Shin Megami Tensei II</a></em> because of this).
</li></ul></li><li> The nymphs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em> are malicious childlike buggers with raspy voices and a penchant for human sacrifice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Elves of have a bit of this trope, seeing how they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eat people</a> and don't consider this to be in any way reprehensible, while considering lying as bad as murder and having an active cultural dislike for self-control. It doesn't help that they will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">besiege you if you cut down too many trees and then proceed to devour your flesh</a>. Since the game perspective in Fortress Mode is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVersusDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVersusDwarves">from the dwarves</a>, though, and elven soldiers only carry wooden weapons and armor, they tend to be seen more as annoying than terrifying.
</li><li> A more fitting example are the Night Trolls, who resemble the more ogrish and monstrous kinds of Unseelie fairies. Occasional marauders who live in caves, they kidnap mortal spouses and corrupt them into similar beings, when they aren't simply eating their flesh. Their grotesque features are even procedurally generated, so that no two Night Trolls are alike.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the gods in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Roguelike">roguelike</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Incursion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Incursion">Incursion</a> is Maeve, Queen of the Faeries. All elves are required to worship her; this is not particularly a good thing, because she is utterly amoral and very capricious: sometimes she gives you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">good equipment</a>, sometimes she surrounds you with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">out-of-depth monsters</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory">Rune Factory</a></em> games, the faeries are small women with wings who shoot sets of fairly powerful, guided magic wind scythes. At mid-level, these are some of the most dangerous normal opponents.
</li><li> The fair folk from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ATaleOfTwoKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ATaleOfTwoKingdoms">A Tale of Two Kingdoms</a></em> are not downright malicious, but tend towards nasty pranks against humans (particularly but not limited to the player character). The powerful and beautiful fairy queen turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not so benevolent as she tries to permanently entrap you in the fairy world</span>.
</li><li> The Folks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Folklore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Folklore">Folklore</a></em> want you dead with a few small exceptions. The "Faeries" are simply the denizens of a realm of the Netherworld created when people dreamed of an afterlife of paradise... but that still doesn't stop the "paradise" from being filled with dozens and dozens of deceased souls that turned into angry Folks that want to kill you.
</li><li> Subverted in the opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>: Tatl and her brother help Skull Kid steal Link's horse, and then she attacks and taunts Link after Skull Kid turns him into a Deku Scrub. She then takes the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> after Skull Kid leaves her behind and stays with Link when she sees Skull Kid try to destroy the world.
<ul><li> Possibly played straight with the Skull Kids themselves, which are referred to along with the Kokiri and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparkFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparkFairy">Spark Fairies</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em> as forest fairies or fairy folk.
</li></ul></li><li> Whilst Erana from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em> fame is the embodiment of all that's pure and good in the world, and like, fabulous as a person to boot, her fair folk friends and family are power-hungry rogues who are not above stepping on a mere mortal to get their hands on Erana's magical staff to gain more power. Doesn't help they're all high-powered mages like their cousin twice removed.
<ul><li> Also played with in the first game, where the hero can be forced to dance with fairies to the point of death.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest">King's Quest</a></em> games. There are wicked ones (Lolotte, Malicia), inscrutable ones (Mab, the Fate Sisters), and benevolent ones (Genesta, Oberon, Titania, and Edgar). Certainly, they can wield magic and have a strange logic on how things should run (The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel">Fan Sequel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSilverLining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSilverLining">The Silver Lining</a></em> also depicts that they prefer to be outside, no matter the weather), but they aren't much different than humans otherwise.
<ul><li> Played straight in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtendedUniverse">Extended Universe</a>, however, where a number of more traditional fairies show up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingsQuestTheFloatingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingsQuestTheFloatingCastle">first</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingsQuestKingdomOfSorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KingsQuestKingdomOfSorrow">second</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TieInNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TieInNovel">Tie In Novels</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Mostly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TearsToTiara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TearsToTiara">Tears to Tiara</a></em>, where The Fair Folk turn out to be pretty nice people indeed. The closest one to this trope is the item shop owner Epona, who at worst is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestJohn">Honest John</a>. Her shop is even called '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">The Good Folk</a>', though this is more of an allusion to mythology (it's set in Britain during the Roman invasion) than a lampshading.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>'s actual fairies don't really fit beyond being mischevious; they're universally stupid and weak. On the other hand, some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> come pretty close, most obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Yukari</a>, who is beautiful, mysterious, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossSubtitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossSubtitles">the one behind the spiritings away</a>.
<ul><li> The fairies aren't completely removed from this, however. They are known for having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">twisted sense of morality due to being immortal</a>, and many of them are too stupid to consider the consequences of their actions. Because of this, they are prone to inflicting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyPrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyPrank">deadly pranks</a> on unfortunate people. Luckily, most fairies are extremely weak and pose little threat, and are rarely intentionally malicious.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has two races of elves: Night Elves and Blood Elves. Night Elves, members of The Alliance, tend to be more benevolent as they're mostly nature lovers, but they are also very fierce warriors who aren't fond of outsiders. The Blood Elves, members of the Horde, are downright evil for the most part as they're very vain and derive their magical power from an imprisoned alien. There are also High Elves, who were the closest to Tolkien's elves, but there are very few left as most of them became Blood Elves. Also, Sylvanas Windrunner, a former High Elf, became a banshee after she died and founded the undead Forsaken, another Horde race (who are arguably also evil by nature since they are undead).
<ul><li> For the most part, the Blood Elves that are with the Horde aren't evil. They imprisoned a Naaru out of desperation more than anything else, because they could potentially die without a new source of magic after the destruction of the Sunwell. They haven't been so bad since the Sunwell was restored and they were given the power of the Light. Now they tend to arrogant pricks at worst, and not too much worse than the Night Elves were.
</li><li> The Blood Elves who followed Kael'Thas into Outland, however, <em>are</em> evil and are aligned with a faction of demons that is bent on destroying all life in the universe.
</li><li> The Night Elves made their first appearance attacking the Orcs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">for cutting down trees</a>. They were also incredibly haughty and xenophobic, ignoring a war going on right in front of them and often attacking both sides with little provocation. It wasn't until the Burning Legion showed up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">and they had no choice but to team up with both of their enemies</a> that they were finally willing to work with any of the other races. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">They were also humbled quite a bit</a> after the destruction of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree">World Tree</a> (which gave them their immortality), and ended up joining the Alliance.
</li><li> Properly speaking, there's a fourth faction of Elves as well, the Naga, former High Elves (from the time when this meant the ruling class of the Night Elves, including their ancient queen, Azshara) twisted by the magical backlash of the destruction of the original Well of Eternity (which ripped the continent apart, leaving the four main continents of Azeroth today) into serpentine forms. They appear bent on retaking their old place as lords of Azeroth. There's quite a waiting line for that spot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RIFT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RIFT">RIFT</a></em> includes faerie as a major faction of bad guy (excepting the rare ones befriended by druids), aligned with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinist">Greenscale</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsNotGood">the Dragon of Life</a>. Many of them look like typical post-Elizabethan sprites, until you notice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackEyesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackEyesOfEvil">one glaring problem with their looks</a>...

</li><li> The Horned Knight in the web game <em>The Last Court</em> holds his own court in the deep woods outside of Serault. His attendants are dryads and he thinks nothing of keeping humans who have offended him as slaves. If allowed to attend the feast of the Divine, the Horned Knight attempts to give her a gift in the form of a "living garden"  a Chantry sister with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">plants growing out of her head</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">dandelions for eyes</a>.

The Seelie mainly operate on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> and are described as honourable and honest 'in their own way' (being Old Faith and Righteous), while the Unseelie are fairy, err, <em>fairly</em> malicious (Old Faith/Tyrant) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">and bargains with them usually involve giving them your subjects' children</a>.

They are also divided into Summer and Winter; Summer representing growth and Winter representing decay, though neither is inherently good or evil. They have mixed feelings about mortals. Some of them dismiss them as short-lived "Dustlings", and others are fascinated by them because of their unique perspective on life and death. The Fae are so powerfully linked to Fate that they do not truly die — they merely repeat their lives in an endless Great Cycle. Fae also occasionally forget that when mortals die, it's for keeps. Fateweaver Argath claims that the Fae are actually <em>easier</em> to understand than mortals because they usually don't change with time. The Tuatha Deohn are a horrific exception to this rule. They are a cult of Winter Fae that have changed thanks to the power of Tirnoch. As a result, they are now brutal warmongers who wish to purge the world of all mortal life.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople">sylvari</a> are largely idealistic, honorable, and romantic — except for the Nightmare Court, who believe that these values weaken them and seek to corrupt their brethren by torturing them into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> (which also pollutes their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>, the Pale Tree, and any future sylvari that might be born from it). Notably, the sylvari moral code actually comes from the writings of a pacifistic centaur and human; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an optional plotline involves the player character discovering that there is more than one Pale Tree, and having to hide that fact from the Nightmare Court — while the sylvari from one of the other trees is still kind, if a bit standoffish, it's specifically brought up that other communities of sylvari might not be nearly as benevolent.</span>
<ul><li> This is taken even further when it's revealed that sylvari are actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the spawn of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Elder Dragon</a> of the jungle, and the playable sylvari are descended from a champion of his that had been cleansed of his will</span>. Their original brethren tend to be more monstrous and, similar to the Nightmare Court, often kidnap those of the other races to corrupt into more minions.
</li></ul></li><li> Some Pokémon of the Fairy-type, introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em>, appear to be this, though most of them are closer to modern depictions. It's worth noting that despite their appearances, Fairy-types are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">super effective against Dragon-type Pokémon</a>, which previously only had the weakness of ice or other dragons. They're also weak against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">the Steel-type</a>, taking extra damage from it.
<ul><li> Gardevoir (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> from pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic</a> to Psychic/Fairy along with its pre-evolutions) easily fits the description of "inhumanly beautiful", and is in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">unrelated to humanoid Pokémon</a> (until Generation VIII) — its closest biological relatives include sundry Ghost-type Pokémon and <em>walking sludge</em>. It's nowhere near as malevolent as this trope usually is though, and in fact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">wants to protect its trainer at all costs</a>.
</li><li> Mawile (based loosely on the Futakuchi-onna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">Youkai</a>) was also retconned as Steel/Fairy from pure Steel. It's not necessarily evil, but it has a huge jaw-like horn in the back of its head (two when in Mega Form) and uses it to chomp its opponents after luring them with its cute appearance and gestures.
</li><li> Mr. Mime, Whimsicott, and Klefki fit the mischievous type of fairy to a T. Mr. Mime is highly adept at tricking people and stealing from them, Whimsicott slips through people's houses and makes a mess of them for fun, and Klefki has a habit of stealing people's keys. Fittingly, Whimsicott and Klefki both have the Prankster ability.
</li><li> Ribombee, a humanoid bee about eight inches tall, is the closest Fairy-type to the modern view of fairies as diminutive, benevolent winged humanoids.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMarvelousDeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMarvelousDeer">Xerneas</a>, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">legendary</a>, also fits the classic fairy definition to a T; while not malevolent (it actually serves as something akin to a god of renewal), it is majestic, otherworldly, difficult for humans to comprehend, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">extremely</a></em> powerful.
</li><li> Shiinotic, a Grass/Fairy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomMan">Mushroom Man</a> is one of the more malevolent Fairy types. It has a rather unnerving look, and it uses its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioluminescenceIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioluminescenceIsCool">bioluminescence</a> to make people get lost in the woods, or to make people drowsy so that it can feed on them by draining their strength.
</li><li> Mimikyu, the first ever Ghost/Fairy-type, is a double subversion. It's a creature that hides its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">unspeakably horrifying appearance</a> underneath a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot">Pikachu</a> disguise due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeLoved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeLoved">a desperate desire to be loved</a>. However, several scenes, both in the games and the anime adaptation, seem to allude to Mimikyu having a bit of a dark side, including an NPC one implicitly threatening to curse you (and it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">no empty threat</a> either), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Totem Mimikyu</a> having a creepy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerShrine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerShrine">Stalker Shrine</a> dedicated to Pikachu and one which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchLocation">vanishes from existence</a> the minute you defeat it, and its new Z-Move, known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho">"Let's Snuggle Forever"</a>.
</li><li> The island guardians of Alola, despite being very powerful protectors revered by the populace, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">aren't entirely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">benevolent or kind</a>. While Tapu Bulu is the nicest of the four (if you don't tick it off) and Tapu Fini is indifferent to human affairs, Tapu Koko is fickle and doesn't always come to save someone from danger, and Tapu Lele can use its scales to energise people into fighting one another to the death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">for its own amusement</a>. Even in-universe, it's hinted that a legend regarding Tapu Lele ending a war by healing warriors with its scales <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disneyfication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Disneyfication">is a sweetened version of a disturbing truth</a>.
</li><li> While many Fairy type Pokemon are very cutesy, look at their moves. A given Fairy types approach to battle involves seduction, manipulation, vampirism, mysterious fogs, lunamancy, and plain old beating the crap out of the opponent. Much more like the Fair Folk than modern fairies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a> introduces two lines of dangerous and malevolent fairies. On one hand, we have the Dark/Fairy Impidimp line. The first stage, Impidimp, is a little imp/goblin that feeds on negative emotions. Its second stage, Morgrem, fights dirty and likes to lure people to get lost in the forest. The final stage, Grimmsnarl, is a brutal, hairy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">troll</a>. On the other hand, there is also the Hattena line. It starts out just Psychic, but gains the Fairy type in the final evolution. Hatenna is harmless and will run away from people with strong emotions. Hattrem, the second stage, will beat them up mercilessly instead and Hatterene will tear people apart if they are too loud around it, and anyone who enters the forests where they live is in danger.
</li><li> Also from <em>Pokémon Sword and Shield</em>, Zacian is a Fairy-type <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleWolf">Noble Wolf</a> Legendary who subverts this trope. It's one of the two graceful guardians of Galar and is the more offensive-oriented of the two, but that doesn't make it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>.
</li><li> We now have this trope when speaking about human Trainers. Bede, one of the rival characters you encounter in <em>Sword and Shield</em>, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who, while he starts off as a Psychic-type trainer, eventually specializes in Fairy-types, and is an arrogant dude who constantly brags about himself to the point he looks down on <em>everyone</em> who battles him. Opal, the Fairy-type Gym Leader, also has shades of this as her battle invokes the "mischievous" aspects of fairies, where she gives you a series of questions that try to trick you into picking the obvious answer instead of the "right" ones. It's no coincidence she ends up picking Bede as her successor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YearWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YearWalk">Year Walk</a></em>, being based on ancient Swedish folklore and tradition, has five fair folks referred to as "The Watchers" who are all very alien in approach and demeanor.
<ul><li> The first one is the Huldra, who looks like a beautiful woman clad in white with sticks protruding out of her. She either lives in or <em>is</em> the biggest, oldest tree in the forest. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">leads men astray with her ethereal voice</a> and, like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">succubus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutWithABang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutWithABang">kills them by having sex with them</a>. However, she's the friend of colliers, can bless hunters' hunts and if blood is offered willingly to her she might lend her assistance... provided she doesn't drain you dry.
</li><li> The second one is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellishHorse">Brook Horse</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan">Sharp-Dressed Horse</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">drowns children</a> that play in its waters, but it may also take in Mylings to care about and carry the spirits of the dead into the afterlife. In the game it wants the protagonist to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FetchQuest">fetch it the souls</a> of four murdered children in exchange for a key.
</li><li> The third are the Mylings, the ghosts of children murdered by their mothers or caretakers. If one hears the cries of a Myling but chooses to ignore it, the Myling will exact its revenge... all it really wants is to be reunited with its mother, though. That said, it's not unheard of for them to murder their mothers once reunited with them.
</li><li> The fourth is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RavensAndCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RavensAndCrows">Night Raven</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrows">small corvid</a> that swoops in and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievingMagpie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThievingMagpie">steals the key</a> the Brook Horse gave you. However, the corvid isn't really the Night Raven. You have to pull the <em>real</em> Night Raven <em>out of the corvid's mouth</em>. Its true form is a ghastly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend">Feathered Fiend</a>. According to folklore, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">merely seeing the holes in a Night Raven's wings can strike a person with horrible pain, terrible disease and/or immediate death</a>.
</li><li> The fifth and final fair being is the Church Grim, a guardian spirit of a sacrifical animal (or executed criminal) with a human's body and a ram's head... actually, it might be more accurate to say that it's a ram's head wearing a coat... and under said coat is nothing, except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatStillMyHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatStillMyHeart">the Heart of the Universe</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>:
<ul><li> The sylph manage to fulfill both ends of the spectrum. Friendly Sylph are relatively harmless and enjoy the company of mortals who can comprehend their rather odd traditions, and also enjoy playing harmless pranks like leaving gifts of fruit in weird places to people they like. Tempered Sylph are much worse, very territorial, they usually don't leave Larkscall, but when they do it's usually to play very cruel, spiteful pranks that could harm or even kill mortals. They also constantly encroach the untempered Sylphs of Little Solace to try to bring them under Ramuh's thrall.
</li><li> <em>Shadowbringers</em> introduces the fuath, a race of short, anthropomorphic frog people with the power to control water. Theyre the most capricious and malicious of the fae tribes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie">Il Mheg</a>, drowning people and attacking other fae for their own amusement. When the player needs to borrow an important relic from them, the Fuath wont give it up unless the player entertains them by fighting through their illusory, monster-infested domain to reach the relic. When the player succeeds, the Fuath give up the relic as promised but try to drown them anyway.

The Monsters you meet throughout your venture into the depths of Mt. Ebott are characterized as bizarre, random, and deceptively logic-defying near-immortal creatures.

Giving them (or the forest or the landmarks within) a name, or being named by a faery, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScottishTrope">a very bad idea</a>, with consequences up to and including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">having one's name stolen</a> (hence why it's not called "SCP-4000"). Foundation members who interact with the faeries must follow a lengthy list of rules to avoid angering them, and even then some of the faeries seem to be innately hostile to humans. One of the faeries claims that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they are the survivors of the attempted genocide mentioned in Bright's Proposal. In their account, the faeries used to be allies and helped the Foundation fight the Factory, but the Foundation's predecessor betrayed them, killing many and somehow stealing their very names.

In this scenario, the Fae are a group of very highly nymphomaniacal races, who move <em>en masse</em> to Earth from Faerie, due to magic having become inactive there and active on Earth, which had caused them to start dying out. In this depiction, the Fae are generally non-hostile (sex is their primary form of interaction with humans), but they are still highly chaotic, and tend to cause severe social disruption; although in this case, primarily in the form of orgies.

When they were released from captivity, they offered cryptic advice to the heroes but later on rampaged in Libaterra, killing hundreds of people in their lust for revenge before retreating back to the forests to live their life in peace. Currently the fey have two factions: the neutral, tradition-bound ones led by Morrigan who wish to live away from the corruption of mortal civilizations, and the fanatic destroyers led by Curdardh who wish to purge the world from "impure" races.

</li><li> In "Crocker of Gold" there are a bunch of leprechauns called the McPunchies. Compared to previous leprechauns, they're a muscular mob-like clan who want their pot of gold back from Crocker.

</li></ul></li><li> The "Third Race" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>. They are said to be creatures of pure magic, and they are vulnerable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdIron">Cold Iron</a>, with varying possibilities; ranging from forcing them into servitude (as was done with Puck and the Weird Sisters), to outright harming and potentially killing them. Also, the general nature, their immense magical prowess and doing as they please is very true. Especially the episode when Oberon and Titania were out to capture Xanatos's son Alexander for the Gathering. Goliath thought it was so vile that he actually <em>sides</em> with Xanatos to prevent Alexander's capture.
<ul><li> Oberon is consistently depicted in the series as capricious, vain and arrogant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">making and breaking edicts on a whim</a>. He <em>is</em>, surprisingly enough, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">Graceful Loser</a>, and capable of being reasonable (though, fittingly, his reason is his own), until he feels he's being disrespected.
</li><li> Aside from their morally questionable leaders, the other "Children of Oberon" in the series vary greatly in personality, disposition, and form. Though they all tend to be pretty mischievous, even the ones that like humans and Gargoyles.
</li><li> Interestingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has said they used to be a whole lot <strong>worse.</strong> After being banished from Avalon, most changed considerably; besides Oberon who, at the time, was <em>mature</em> and <em>compassionate</em> in comparison, and didn't feel like he had anything to learn. And don't even get started on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">mother, Mab</a>. In fact, Mab allegedly was so terrible that Oberon is generally seen as an improvement by his people.
</li><li> Titania, his wife, seems to be of the other type thankfully, and is more than capable of controlling her husband (granted, she was actually much worse and the only reason she changed was because Oberon cursed her to learn humility). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unfortunately, she's the instigator for the incident with Alexander. And then also the instigator for the interference of the Gargoyles</span>.
</li><li> On the other hand, Puck, another prominent member of the Third Race, is a classical trickster with a great aptness for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. While more benevolent than fellow tricksters Raven or Anansi, he's a great schemer when he needs to be and not above playing Goliath and Co. for his own benefit.

<ul><li> Discord, somewhere between a spirit of bedlam and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">god of chaos</a>, hews closer to the characterization of fairies and their ilk as being spiteful and petty.
