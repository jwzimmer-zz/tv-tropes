</p><p>What's left for the modern hero and villain to do? Make do with a Weaksauce Weakness.

<ul><li> Tobor, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EighthMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EighthMan">8th Man</a></em>, recharged his powers with an inhalant stored in small, thin, white tubes that he carried in a cigarette case. When the bad guys allowed him "one last smoke" before executing him, this was great; when he was having a fight where kids could see him, he worried about setting a bad example by appearing to smoke.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vampires are seen as nearly invincible gods among men...unless the sun is out. Or you punch them with sunlight-infused martial arts. Or you hit them <em>really</em> hard in the brain and screw up their ability to control their own bodily functions (though not many beings out there <em>aren't</em> weak to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">Chunky Salsa Rule</a>). Or just have a Pillar Man (essentially super vampires) so much as touch them, which will cause them to be instantly absorbed.
</li><li> Pillar Men also have a weakness to the sun and Hamon, but due to their biology (and possibly Kars'/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Cars'</a> stone masks) they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">can turn themselves into something similar to stone</a> blocking off UV rays. When Kars becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeform">Ultimate Lifeform</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeroHoldTheWeaksauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeroHoldTheWeaksauce">he loses his weakness to the sun</a> among other benefits.
</li><li> Rock Humans in part 8 are resistant to damage and fatigue, but despite being partly rock they're dependent on oxygen, "breathing" it through their skin. This means that submerging them in water causes them to rapidly "suffocate" and break apart, though Josuke probably didn't help matters when he stole the oxygen from one's body in an attempt to force him to surface.
</li><li> Some powerful Stands also incorporate this trope for narrative balance reasons. One key example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureDiamondIsUnbreakable">Part Four's</a> Red Hot Chili Pepper. Since it becomes stronger and faster the more electricity it has access to, with no stated or hinted upper limit, it can be said to be one of the most powerful stands in Part 4, excluding only <em>arguably</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast">Killer Queen:</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">Bites the Dust</a>. But this comes with two weaksauce weaknesses; first, if you cut off its access to electricity, say, by destroying the motorcycle battery it was hiding in, it rapidly weakens and fades. Second, since salt water is such an excellent conductor, immersing it in the ocean will cause it to rapidly dissolve.
</li><li> For certain stands, <em>the user</em> is their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Weaksauce Weakness</a>. All non-automatic stands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Synchronization">share damage</a> with their users, but some stands are pretty much impossible to directly hurt, like Yellow Temperance (amorphous blob), The Sun (too hot for anyone to get near it), The Fool, and Horus (can reform from sand and ice, respectively). Their <em>users</em>, on the other hand, can be hurt like normal (and are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">glass cannons</a>), and their defeats will cause their stand to de-manifest.
</li><li> There's also The Hand in part 4, a Stand with the ability to <em>literally erase anything, even space itself, from existence.</em> A truly overpowered stand, in principle...except its user is Okuyasu: a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents">Japanese Delinquent</a> with the IQ of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">a brick wall</a> who doesn't have the brains to use it creatively nor the heart to actually use it directly against people.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Moriking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Moriking">Moriking</a></em>, the ridiculously powerful king candidates are all susceptible to cardiac arrest via consuming overly spicy food like kimchi stew or curry. Moriking and Oki find this out the hard way, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> and they're perfectly fine afterward.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, female spell-casters have a very common and mundane weakness: menstruation. During a woman's menstruation period, her magical power output drops tremendously, so much so that even the protagonist, Lina Inverse, who is one of the strongest sorceresses in the entire Slayers setting, is barely able to cast a novice <em>Light</em> spell during her period. This is apparently a well-known weakness, as Zelgadis and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Gourry</a> both figure out why her powers are weakened at one point, though Gourry is so ignorant that he doesn't understand the significance of "that time of the month" and just assumes it's magic-related.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Anyone who's eaten a Devil Fruit gets amazing powers, but they all share one weakness; the inability to swim. <em>At all.</em> If they are so much as half-submerged in water of any kind, they become paralyzed (and for many, their powers stop working). Which is <em>kind of a problem</em>, seeing as how many of the encountered Devil Fruit users are <strong>pirates or marines</strong> in a world that's <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OceanPunk">ninety percent ocean</a></strong></em>.
<ul><li> If a Devil Fruit user touches Seastone - a material that has been described as "solid sea" - they'll feel the same effects as if they were fully submerged in water.
</li></ul></li><li> Though this is more of a subversion in that this weakness very, very rarely becomes an issue, especially considering how many Devil Fruit users are in the series and how four of them are in the main cast. This is even lampshaded in the Enies Lobby arc; when two members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">CP9</a> are trying to decide whether or not to eat Devil Fruits that had been provided to them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonInChief">Rob Lucci</a> mentions that being unable to swim isn't much of a problem (then again, all members of CP9 have the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleJump">Double Jump</a>, so there's that).
</li><li> Depending on the situation, basic hypnosis (such as Jango's ring or Ms. Goldenweek's emotion-altering paint) serves as one of the weaknesses for Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist. Due to his simple-minded nature, he just won't have the sense to turn away, which makes him helpless and left to the devices of his enemies.
</li><li> Water is actually a much greater weakness to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">Sir Crocodile</a>, as he is a man who can turn into sand; if water strikes him, the sand "sticks together," and he is rendered unable to turn into sand at all, thus leaving him fully open to attack. He has a natural defense in that his sand powers extend to causing alarmingly fast dehydration with direct skin contact. In addition, he has the good sense to not only do his villainous business on a relatively large island, but on a <em>desert island.</em> He also uses Dance Powder to not only to frame the king in an effort to overthrow him, but also to stop it from raining in the town he was using as a base. In addition, on the off-chance that someone was able to negate his logia defense for a significant period time (like with Luffy), he's skilled in other combat arts as well. His hook has a second, <em>poisoned</em> hook under it, and if <em>that</em> hook gets broken, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">he can eject a knife in its place</a>.
</li><li> Fishmen or Fishmen-hybrids who have eaten Devil Fruits are unable to swim like any other Devil Fruit user, but unlike them, they still can breathe underwater. The problem with that is that they can't move underwater without being surrounded by a special coat of bubble.
</li><li> In-universe, at least, we have Enel. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Shock and Awe</a> abilities are considered among the most godlike Devil Fruit powers in the setting, yet Luffy's relatively low-tier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Rubber Man</a> powers completely and utterly negated them, to the point that Eneru had to get really creative with his powers just to find a way to harm Luffy at all, and only his unrelated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">Spider-Sense</a> ability protected him from getting beaten to a pulp pretty much instantly.
<ul><li> Logia-type Devil Fruits in general tend to react weirdly to various elements, and almost always have at least one weakness that completely shuts down their powers. Moreover, hitting their elemental forms with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Haki-infused attacks</a> damages them as if they were in regular form.
</li></ul></li><li> Blackbeard has one of the most powerful abilities in universe. He can wipe out entire towns in seconds, shoot the debris out like cannon, and negate Devil Fruit powers. But he has a major weakness that isn't shared by any other fruit of the same class as his. While most Logia-fruit users can have attacks pass right through them, Blackbeard is quite the opposite; Because his Devil fruit ability makes him a "Gravity Man", his body is always in physical form. Not only that, but the same qualities that let him negate other Devil Fruit powers (by forcibly holding their bodies together) also draws attacks INTO him. This means that his biggest strength also makes any attack made in his direction both harder to dodge and <em>super-effective</em>. Essentially, even the most basic of attacks is capable of forcing him to hunch over in pain.
</li></ul></li><li> The specialists, the Paper Sisters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReadOrDie">Read or Dream</a></em> can telekinetically manipulate paper... unless it's <em>wet</em>. This was not a weakness for Yomiko Readman, who <em>is</em> shown on camera manipulating paper while underwater. This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">explained in-universe</a>. The Paper Sisters' powers are essentially imperfect clones of Yomiko's, artificially created by Dokusensha; which is why they are weaker and more specialized/limited. Water naturally disrupts the structural integrity of paper, and their inferior powers are not sufficient to maintain it the way Yomiko can.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> has an alien attack force made up of gigantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a> who are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">proud warrior race</a> do a mass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookFaceTurn">MookFace Turn</a> because of... singing. And souvenirs. In fairness, it does make sense in the story (at least as much as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheWorlds">The War of the Worlds</a></em> Martians being vulnerable to Earth's diseases) and is perhaps one of the best logical conclusions to a typical alien's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Planet of Hats</a> treatment. The Zentradi have no culture to speak of other than fighting, so when exposed to humans and their culture in the form of songs and interacting with the other gender after sending a team of spies to the SDF-1, typical Zentradi start feeling emotions, questioning their purpose, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanityIsInfectious">becoming similar to humans</a>. Because of this, their entire fleet gets deemed "contaminated" by the unexposed Zentradi and programmed for destruction. In the face of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a>, they wisely choose to ally with the humans. Still, it doesn't quite wash away the faint air of ridiculousness when Minmay's singing becomes an <em>offensive weapon</em> to unbalance the unexposed Zentradi in their attack.
<ul><li> Those who consider Minmei <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> half-jokingly argue the Zentraedi were distracted by her singing because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreadfulMusician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreadfulMusician">it was so bad</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> dub.
</li><li> The initial use of Minmay's voice as a weapon is actually short-lived: while the Zentradi were initially too distracted to react, as soon as the heroes opened fire they started firing back. The real decisive weapon in that engagement was Minmei kissing Kaifun: the Zentradi were so disgusted they stopped fighting effectively, trying absolutely anything to erase the image from their minds, including firing in the middle of nowhere (a Zentradi heavy cruiser was observed doing exactly this as Hikaru locked his nukes on it) and listening to Minmei's songs.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken to even greater extremes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em> where the spirit draining Protodevilns's only weakness is actually the <em>energy</em> produced by music. It produces a spiritual energy "too pure for them to absorb" and regenerates the lost energy in those drained by them.
<ul><li> In one humorous scene, a Protodeviln gets a "brilliant idea" for shielding himself against the humans' singing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">He puts on earplugs.</a> This actually does work, but Basara just plays even louder. Afterward the Protodeviln installed a noise canceller in his mech, which proved much more effective.
</li><li> Incidentally, one OVA shows us that Minmei's registered songs have absolutely no effect on unexposed Meltrandi (the FEMALE Zentradi), who just ignore them (partly because they had the common sense to just jam the frequencies used to broadcast them), but BASARA's songs made them groupies the very moment he managed to get them to hear him. It baffled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">UN Spacy higher-up</a>, who had assumed the Meltrandi would just jam the broadcast (both times the Minmei tactic had been seen used had been with broadcasts the enemy didn't jam for one reason or another).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>, vampires are considered the high end of the monster scale, but the fact that you can take a vampire down with a glass of water kinda puts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">dampener</a> on that idea. Though, you'd have to be of werewolf speed to even <em>consider</em> hitting them with the stuff in the first place. Vampires are ironically said to have the most weaknesses compared to any other monster. Things like silver would also do them in. However, they are still incredibly strong even when weakened by those weaknesses, albeit far weaker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ranma Saotome can be incapacitated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">the mere sight of a cute little kitten</a>. However, those who attempt this should note to apply said weakness quickly and forcefully — prolonged, intense exposure has a tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">backfire</a>. Thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> curse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithWater">cold water</a> can also count as a weakness. Technically. Ranma's female form has less strength and reach than his male form (though the anime is explicit that Ranma's speed is boosted in this form, so it's more of a trade), but s/he can still pull off all of his/her normal attacks. Based on a character with an identical curse, it's also possible that being in female form weakens his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki Attacks</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser">Shampoo</a> and Ryoga Hibiki have an even worse case of the water weakness than Ranma does; Jusenkyo made them become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">little kitten and miniature pig</a> respectively when splashed with cold water. So they go from incredibly powerful fighters to harmless little animals whose only recourse is to run or hide until they can get some hot water. Genma Saotome, Ranma's father, subverts it; his panda form loses little, if any, speed and agility while gaining in strength and toughness due to the increased <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">bulk</a>. Mousse, meanwhile, seesaws between subverting this trope and playing it straight with his duck curse; while it is much smaller, weaker and can't use his physical attacks, it can fly and he's still capable of throwing barrages of knives, darts and bombs in it.
</li><li> And a non-water version applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Happosai</a>, who is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a> that his perversion becomes his own Achilles heel. If there is a fight serious enough, or a reward great enough, that he can't be immediately distracted from whatever he was doing by the sight of girls in skimpy clothing, bare cleavage or a bra, it hasn't come up in the series. He can even be lured right into dangers simply by tossing a bra in the right place.
</li><li> Spoiled prince Saffron has incredible fire magic powers, the ability to fly and regenerate so fast that he can tear off his own wings to use as throwing weapons and grow them back in seconds, but because of his lax and pampered upbringing he can't take any sort of physical blow and in a world full of martial artists that's a big problem.

At least once it was actually exploited to defeat him in battle. This motion sickness seems to extend to being carried by people, as well.

But he can only project them where ordinary shadows could be cast; complete darkness renders him unable to attack and bright lights can cut off his tentacles. Granted, he is still near immortal even when he can't attack; in a way he is both the most powerful and the most vulnerable homunculus.
</li><li> A common mistake for people in the series is to assume that Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang is useless when wet (or without his gloves). This is only true to a certain extent - while his gloves can't create a spark when they're wet, there's nothing stopping him from using something else in their place (like a lighter) as long as he has access to the right kind of transmutation circle. He's arguably <em>more</em> dangerous with lots of water around so long as he has an alternative method of creating a spark, as he can split the water into hydrogen and oxygen and then ignite it... the problem is that unless he can trap the target in an enclosed area with the water he's liable to blow up any nearby allies and <em>himself</em> at the same time, hence this technique being very rarely used.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> superhero movie <em>Surge of Power: The Stuff of Heroes</em>, both the hero and villain have their powers nullified by the presence of peppy music.

And are completely incapable of breaking down wooden doors.
</li><li> In Shyamalan's earlier film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable">Unbreakable</a></em>, water is also used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">weakness for the main superhero character</a>. In that case, though, it isn't that he is especially vulnerable to water, but rather he is just as susceptible to drowning as a normal person. If he drinks something too quickly, he will choke and if he is submerged he will succumb to drowning just like everyone else — though it was theorized that the dense bone and muscle that make him <em>unbreakable</em> also make him <em>unfloatable</em> (or the character simply can't swim). There is a complicating factor in the scene where he ends up almost drowning in a swimming pool: he's tangled up in a big piece of fabric, which would give anyone a bad time while in water. It is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">psychological weakness</a>: he had almost drowned once as a child (probably due to the aforementioned bone density), an event so traumatic he blocked it from his memory. That would make anyone nervous around water, even if they couldn't remember why.
</li><li> Shyamalan probably got the weakness idea for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Signs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Signs">Signs</a></em> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvasionOfTheSaucerMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InvasionOfTheSaucerMen">Invasion of the Saucer Men</a></em>, whose aliens were melted by <em>light</em>. There is nothing lamer. Especially considering they were done in by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the headlights of teenage hot rodders</span>!
</li><li> The Bioraptors (also called "Demons") of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack">Pitch Black</a></em> has a similar weakness to light. Though this actually works, as most of the movie is during a solar eclipse and they broke their flashlights. Oddly enough, the creatures are shown moving about in the light, albeit cautiously, before the eclipse. Compare this to later on, when a lighter is enough to make them run away...
</li><li> The weakness to light appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheEyeCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheEyeCreatures">Attack of the Eye Creatures</a></em> (because it was an almost word-for-word remake of <em>Invasion of the Saucer Men</em>).
</li><li> Also happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMolePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMolePeople">The Mole People</a></em>, in which a lost colony of ancient Sumerians living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth">Beneath the Earth</a> had adapted to their lightless conditions to the point where our heroes can kill them with a <em>flashlight</em>.
</li><li> In the movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayOfTheTriffids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayOfTheTriffids">The Day of the Triffids</a></em>, the title monsters are melted by sea water. Nearly as lame. In the original novel, ironically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">flame-throwers</a> are among the most effective anti-Triffid weapons.
</li><li> The Tenctonese in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienNation">Alien Nation</a></em> (the movie as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlienNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlienNation">the series</a>) are harmed by <em>salt water</em>. Seawater is like acid to them. They live mostly on the Californian coast; while they do develop a tolerance to it, direct exposure is still harmful to them. There is a slightly funny moment when the police find the partially-dissolved body of a Newcomer washed up on the beach. When asked how they were able to identify him, they simply shrug and show his soaked wallet. All his clothes were, naturally, fine too.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UpUpAndAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UpUpAndAway">Up, Up and Away!</a></em>, the weakness of the superhero family is aluminum foil. However, it's never made clear if it was just their family or all supers who are vulnerable to foil. Both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> are mentioned to exist in this 'verse, and they don't have any weakness to aluminum foil (although Supes has his own weakness). The bad guys definitely assume that all supers have this weakness, as, when Randy claims to have powers, they give him some foil to test it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SYNGENOR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SYNGENOR">SYNGENOR</a></em>, the title creatures were created to be the perfect soldiers for a war with the Middle East. They don't need to eat or sleep, are immune to most weaponry, and reproduce every twenty-four hours. Their only weakness? Water is like acid to them. It's somewhat hard to be afraid of a super soldier that can be defeated with a super soaker. Or, if worst came to worst, by peeing on them.
</li><li> In the Dead Gentlemen Productions (of <em>The Gamers</em> fame) running <em>Demon Hunters</em> series, Duamerthrax the Indestructible is a walking brick that is, well, all but indestructible. He's an "earthwalker", a demon said to have been kicked out of hell for being <em>too mean</em>. Unlike other monsters and demons in the mythos, he's not susceptible to ordinary injury. He can eat the round of a large-caliber revolver jammed in his mouth ("Mmm! Nice 'n' leady!") casually regrows limbs after being dismembered, and generally shrugs off what few injuries he even takes while making terrible puns. So what's the convenient balance? We're told that every earthwalker has a weakness to some substance, "a plant, metal, anything". Duamerthrax's turns out to be <em>mint</em>. Being shot repeatedly at close range with numerous handguns does little more than inconvenience him, but the breath of someone having just used breath spray causes him intense pain, water-guns full of mouthwash can inflict serious harm and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mint dental floss can do even worse things. Ultimately subverted; he turns out to have faked his defeat when the body cont got where he needed it, regenerated almost immediately, and the credits show him happily dancing away. Then he gets hit by a car and sent back to hell in the beginning of the second movie</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarsAttacks">Mars Attacks!</a></em>. The Martians' weakness is hearing high-pitched yodeling, such as in the song "Indian Love Call" by Slim Whitman, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourHeadAsplode">causes their heads to explode</a>.
</li><li> The Tomatoes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheKillerTomatoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheKillerTomatoes">Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!</a></em> have the same weakness, in the form of a song called "Puberty Love".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy1999">The Mummy (1999)</a></em>: Imhotep in his incomplete form is immediately chased away when a cat is in his presence, because they guard the Underworld. Naturally, the heroes never do anything to exploit this weakness, such as by putting cats in the room full of the people he needs to kill to stop being vulnerable to cats.
</li><li> From 1966 superhero parody <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RatPfinkABooBoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RatPfinkABooBoo">Rat Pfink A Boo Boo</a></em>: "Remember, Boo Boo, we have only one weakness... bullets."

Somewhat justified in that the ED-209 is just meant to look intimidating and get bought up by the military, not to do real police work.

It'd be like a human exploding in a smear of gore after stubbing their toe. The given reason is that the planet's atmosphere ignites upon the slightest exposure to radiation.

What is it that finally laid the mighty monster low? The primal forces of nature themselves or divine intervention? No. The police sicced the hounds on him. That's it.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfJudges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfJudges">Judges 1:19</a> is often taken by unbelievers and skeptics to argue that <em>iron chariots</em> are a weakness of God; as the King James Version translates it, it reads <em>"And the Lord was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron."</em> Needless to say, this interpretation is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.apologeticspress.org/apcontent.aspx?category=6&amp;article=301">not generally accepted by believers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, particularly since the iron chariot was a mighty weapon in that era.
</li><li> The great Samson got his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionalPowers">Nazirite rituals</a> (not cutting your hair, taking alcohol, or touching the dead), and breaking them was his big weakness. He attempted to mask this by making up a bunch of equally weaksauce fake weaknesses, only to kill anyone who actually tried them. He was still stupid enough to tell his true weakness to Delilah, despite her being the only one who knew of his "weaknesses" and therefore the only one who could have told them to his enemies. By the time he'd cut his hair he'd already violated other parts of the Nazirite rituals, such as drinking alcohol, and handling dead bodies. Cutting his hair was the last straw, so to speak.
</li><li> Considering that Sampson continued consorting with Delilah long after she'd made it ridiculously obvious that she was committed to selling him out to the Philistines, and even <em>told her his real weakness,</em> it could be argued that his worst Weaksauce Weakness was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoneyTrap">pretty women</a>.
</li><li> Some scholars believe Samson is infact an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of an earlier Hebrew Sun God, and that his long blond hair was symbolic of the sun's rays/corona. Hence, cutting it off took away his powers.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a>: When Baldr/Balder/Baldur, the son of Odin, was born, his mother Frigg made all living things vow not to be able to hurt him. The only living thing that didn't make this promise was mistletoe, as she felt it was too young to be bound to such a promise, and so it alone would be fatal to him. The gods made a game of it, throwing random items at Baldr and amusing themselves by watching the projectiles deliberately avoid striking him. Loki, the trickster god, deceived her so that she would reveal this weakness. He acquired some mistletoe and brought it to the blind god Hoor, telling him that he should also get to participate in the gods' fun little game; of course, when the mistletoe struck Baldur, it killed him. Baldur's death was the start of the chain of events that led to Ragnarok (see further below for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilSurvivor">Devil Survivor</a></em> example).
</li><li> Vampires:
<ul><li> The badass creatures of the night who always want to suck your blood, tend to have a <em>lot</em> of weaknesses. Popular tradition holds that you're fine as long as you stay in the sunlight, have some garlic, stay inside your house and refuse to let them in, or even wield a simple cross. Then there's the older, more obscure, and even more restrictive weaknesses such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotCrossRunningWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotCrossRunningWater">inability to cross running water</a> or the inability to stand constant bell ringing (related to church bells). One of the worst is a compulsion to count small objects, enabling anyone to stop them with a handful of grain. Pretty much the only traditional weakness of vampires that's <em>not</em> weaksauce is the whole wooden stake bit, since getting stabbed through the heart with a pointy stick kills most things.
</li><li> The multitude of fiction involving vampires, though, has led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">multitude of differing weaknesses</a> — including varying degrees of effectiveness. In some settings, vampires are weak to silver, and other religious symbols affect them as much as Christian ones. One that has appeared in modern media is what the now-defunct Gamer Jargon website called the "cheesecloth ribcage", where a vampire can be killed with any half-hearted stab at the chest with a wooden object. The site cited <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromDuskTillDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromDuskTillDawn">From Dusk Till Dawn</a></em> as the worst offenders. On the inverse, many of the works that tend toward "non-standard" portrayals of vampires also go at length to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourVampiresSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourVampiresSuck">mock</a> the traditional weaknesses.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> are terror-inducing beings of legend and myth, often full-on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warpers</a>... and yet, they can be beaten by a stick of iron, a horseshoe, a length of rowan wood, clothes worn inside-out, or a <em>stick of bread</em>. A popular explanation for the weakness comes from Victorian Era archaeologists, who held that this is all just symbolism for the bronze and stone-working cultures being conquered by iron-working ones. Later academics (like Dr. Diane Purkiss) have shown there's no archaeological or historical evidence for this.
<ul><li> This is an especially big problem for the Nuckelavee of Orcadian folklore. Widely considered the most malevolent elf in all of Scotland, the Nuckelavee is an eldritch horror that resembles a man on horseback, if the man was fused to the horse and both had all their skin flayed off. It rides through the countryside destroying crops, killing travelers, causing floods and plagues and generally being a harbinger for all things bad. How do you defeat this monstrosity? Fresh water, and burning seaweed. The Nucklavee fears freshwater, so much so that it cannot cross a stream, and hides in its oceanic lair during the winter storms. Likewise, it finds the smell of burning seaweed intolerably offensive. However, don't provoke the Nucklavee, especially with taunting or burning seaweed, as whenever the Nucklavee is offended, it tries to kill all of the horses in the Orkneys with a hideous disease called "Mortasheen".
</li><li> The Irish/Celtic Dullahan, a fearsome headless fairy that rides at night (either alone or accompanied by banshees) to splash buckets of blood into people's faces — to announce the recipient of a face-full will soon die. They're also a mean shot with a whip, and sometimes drive horse-drawn carriages decorated with human skulls and femurs. There's no known way to actually kill a Dullahan, and the only way to ward one off is to exploit its intense fear of... gold. That's right; the Dullahan, possibly one of the most pants-wettingly scary portents of imminent death, can easily be warded off by one of the metals most commonly used to make jewelry.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Werewolves have their share of weaknesses, too; earlier legends provide ones such as having an iron bar thrown over their head — although hitting somebody with an iron bar is pretty incapacitating for most creatures — drawing three drops of blood, or having their name announced one to three times. The popular weakness to silver weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">is a relatively new invention</a>. It often comes with an immunity to anything not made of silver. Most werewolves that don't have the silver weakness can be killed by any type of weapon, including silver.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasiliskAndCockatrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasiliskAndCockatrice">Basilisks</a>. Okay, they can kill you if you look directly at them, or hear their voice, or if you touch them, or it breaths on you, but guess what? They can be killed instantly by the crowing of a rooster, and their powers don't work on weasels. In some legends, Basilisks are also weak to themselves. There are stories of men killing a basilisk by wearing <em>mirrors sewn into clothing</em>.

Yeah, they can rip you limb from limb with their bare hands, but a little sunlight turns 'em into inanimate rocks. One good way to trick a troll into watching the sunrise is to challenge them to a game of riddles: no troll can resist such a challenge. But beware: according to the legends trolls are extremely good at riddles, and if you decide to give up before dawn then they celebrate their victory by eating the loser.

</li></ul><ul><li> Achilles was the greatest of the Greek Heroes. When he was born, his mother dipped his body in the river Styx (or into a fire, depending on which version of the story it is) so that he would be invincible. The only part of him that wasn't affected was his heel, which was where she held him. Given that the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">named after him</a>, you can guess what happened to him eventually. However, some of the myths indicate that he was shot with arrows poisoned with hydra venom, the same ones that killed Hercules, which deflects the weaksauce bit.
</li><li> In folk tradition, salt is often used to repel evil. It was said a circle of salt could protect one from witches, that salt over your doorstep would ward off ghosts and evil spirit. Salt was often seen as a symbol of purity, especially in its uses: Salt is a conservation agent after all, and salt-cured meats don't spoil. Salt as a purifier appears in Shinto (Where it is used as a ritual purifier and small mounds of salt can be used to repel evil spirits) and Christianity (where it is used before mass and to consecrate a church).
</li><li> In Arabic legend, a ghoul could be killed with a single kick. However, there's a flip side: kick the ghoul again and it immediately springs back to life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kappa">Kappa</a> in Japanese myth are river goblins ranging from mischievous to outright malicious who are said to kidnap children to drown them or tear out their souls and livers.

The result is that Black Mambas could be (and routinely were in gameplay) easily defeated by lightweight <em>Cheetah</em> scout Gears.

So, fairly unique Catches like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryWeapon">Swords Of The Cross</a>", "Wizards Born Under Special Circumstances", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulPower">Soulfire</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Nuclear Detonations</a>" won't reduce the point costs for the power(s), while more common and known substances (like iron vs Fey, holy items vs Black Court Vampires, or physical attacks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">a brick loaded sock</a> against a magically immune creature) will give you back more points to potentially work with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em>, there are some creatures and villains who are immune to anything except one weakness. For example, a Hangin' Judge is vulnerable to a weapon held by a legitimate lawman on duty, a Tummy Twister to hot chili peppers, and Jasper Stone to suicide. That last one is technically correct, but it's so much more. The conditions are actually "Stone can only be killed by a gun fired by his own stone-cold hands", so suicide counts... but so would redirecting his shot before it hit its target. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So would having Young Stone and Old Stone shoot each other.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> has the concept of "frailties", little weaknesses that certain fae (and overly-powerful changelings) are prey to. Some of them are the classic faerie weaknesses, others can be as odd as "must drink alcohol instead of water" or "cannot cross lines of ants". The only universal weakness is iron, which isn't as dangerous as you think because pure iron is rare... and <em>steel</em> does nothing. These weaknesses differ from subject to subject; the fiction for one book has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> mortal invoking every bane she knows from the old tales in an attempt to scare off one of the Gentry. None of them work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>, vampires have all the "classic" weaknesses found in folklore; crosses, garlic, wooden stakes, sunlight, as well as a couple usually attributed to other monsters (wolfsbane, silver). One weakness that's rather unique to <em>Rifts</em>, and the most weaksauce of all, is running water, in any form. Which means a vampire that can shrug off nuclear detonations and hails of rail gun bullets can be taken down by a <em>squirt gun</em>.
</li><li> It's possible to give a character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a></em> such a weakness via the Susceptibility Disadvantage. Water, for example, could be worth quite a few points depending on how many dice the character takes from it since it's one of the most common substances in practically any game world. This would make it impossible for your character to do such simple things as bathe or shower, and any kid armed with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepletedPhlebotinumShells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepletedPhlebotinumShells">Super-Soaker and/or a bucket of water balloons</a> would become a credible threat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, the reason that most large creatures ultimately fall under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> is because they can easily be dealt with using simple, cheap, and ubiquitous spells like the one-mana <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=UNSUMMON">Unsummon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A great specific example is Marit Lage, an ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> summoned from <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=dark+depths">Dark Depths<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who, at 20/20, is capable of killing a planeswalker in a single hit, and who requires <em>30 mana</em> to summon under normal circumstances, can be undone with a single <em>Unsummon</em>.
</li><li> Anything in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld">Bleak World</a></em> with the water weakness is going to be this, as such vampires can go out in neither sunlight or rain. Don't even get us started on the GM who decides to put the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> at the bottom of a lake.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a></em>, a Limburger Sandwich is a +3 item that also gives an instant victory against the Floating Nose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a>: Lands of Creation</em> describes the Adamant Oriole Sanctuary, a country filled with many species of songbird. If all the birds ever go silent, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Primordial</a> that sleeps beneath the land will wake up and destroy it.
</li><li> The various "Van Richten's Guide to..." books from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> setting show that finding and exploiting these is Van Richten's favored strategy. Considering how dangerous Ravenloft monsters tend to be, it's generally good advice.
</li><li> The tarrasque in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> is a very high-level monster intended to be an apocalyptically powerful engine of destruction, and its Third Edition incarnation is exactly that— to anything within its (admittedly large) melee range. But if its enemies can stay out of melee (such as via magical flight, which any party of appropriate level *will* have access to) it is helpless to do anything while said enemies use ranged attacks and spells to whittle down its HP. This was infamous enough for the designers to take notice of and correct in later rulesets— the Fourth Edition tarrasque has a weird aura that stops anyone nearby from flying too high, while the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> incarnation has absolutely ridiculous jumping abilities and the ability to shoot spikes from its tail.

Research into why the iron did not work reveals that the ancient documents that the information was obtained from were actually misprinted versions found in an ancient garbage dump and that the symbol for cold and the symbol for north are very similar. Turns out the weakness is not cold iron but "north seeking iron" (lodestone), they are vulnerable to strong magnetic fields.

Stuck in "Pain" mode, Himcules continues to gain more and more muscle (and even pleasure) every second he makes her cry in pain... then she comes upon a little girl who kindly (sorta) switches her "Pain" switch to "Tickle", and it just so happens that laughing at Himcules is his only weakness.

<ul><li> Crocodiles. Easily one of nature's deadliest predators, incredibly hardy and adaptable, can heal from <em>torn off limbs</em> and have remained virtually unchanged since the age of the dinosaurs since their design was perfectly adaptable to weather through several mass extinctions. But a croc's biggest, most pathetic weakness? While their jaw-closing muscles are incredibly strong and capable of ripping a zebra's leg clean off...their <em>jaw-opening</em> muscles are surprisingly weak, able to be held shut by a thick rubber band, a roll of tape, or even by human hands. It's almost as if evolution found out crocodiles were too overpowered and decided to give them at least <em>one</em> weakness.

This requires being hit in the chest over the heart at the right point of a heartbeat. Only a few dozen cases are reported per year, but victims are almost <em>guaranteed</em> to die if it happens (survival rate is 35% ... if the victim is treated in three minutes). Even a gentle blow that doesn't bruise the skin can trigger commotio cordis—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">which means every time you get hit in the chest, you're playing Russian Roulette</a>.

That's right, there's people who were unfortunate enough to be born allergic to a substance they can't live without. It's technically not an allergy, but that doesn't make it any better. Any moisture build up on their skin aggravates the condition, so they must carry umbrellas with them at all times, avoid heavy clothing/exercise to prevent sweating and prefer to remain indoors in well ventilated surroundings.

</li><li> The skins of land snails and slugs are water permeable, and as such, are extremely vulnerable to fatally drying out. It's also why they're limited to dark, moist environments. Salt kills land snails and slugs by screwing up their osmotic balance, in that the salt speeds up the drying process by pulling the water inside of their cells and internal organs out.

That's why, for example, elephants keep at least 3 legs on the ground when running (rearing up on their hind legs, as is sometimes seen in circuses, is <em>not</em> a natural behavior). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">Gravity is a bitch</a>.
</li><li> Most electronic devices can be damaged irreparably by brief contact with water.
<ul><li> It isn't the water that kills it. All electronics are only good up to a certain voltage or current. Go beyond the specification of a given part for either and it goes boom. Water simply provides a method of short circuiting the gadget, thus bringing the current over what the electronic likes, usually. If you dunked a cellphone (without the battery) in water and let it dry for a day or two, it could still operate. Wouldn't recommend you try it though.
<ul><li> In fact, the best way to clean your keyboard if it can take the abuse? <strong>Run it through the dishwasher.</strong>
</li><li> When an electric device has become wet it can be dried quicker by first dunking it in another fluid (that may or may not be able to shortcircuit the electronics by conducting electricity itself) with a lower boiling point. This fluid will replace most of the water in the device and afterwards evaporate quicker, leaving the device dry and ready to use sooner.
</li><li> Static electricity can do this as well if you touch electronic components directly while carrying a charge in your body. Your desktop can be <em>murdered by your carpet.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Modern electronics are often powered by Lithium-Ion batteries because of their high charge speed, stable voltage and limited charge decay. Problem is that lithium <em>catches fire in contact with water</em>. A damaged battery <strong>must</strong> be discarded immediately. This is applicable for electric cars as well - battery fire has destroyed a fair deal of vehicles that way.
</li></ul></li><li> Early stealth aircraft can very easily lose their stealthiness to the most mundane of things.
<ul><li> The B-2 Spirit is one of the most advanced stealth bombers in the world. Yet the radar-absorbent coating can be easily damaged by weather effects like rain, which is why they're housed in climate-controlled hangers.
</li><li> The F-117 Nighthawk, the world's first stealth fighter, had a radar-absorbent coating that would be ruined by just leaving <em>fingerprints.</em>
</li><li> More modern stealth aircraft have much more durable coatings, with the F-22's topcoat continually being updated, and the F-35's coating, called <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiberMat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiberMat">Fiber Mat</a>, actively baked into the skin structure.
</li></ul></li><li> Some people with PTSD have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Trigger">triggers</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareRetardant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareRetardant">Nightmare Retardant</a> variety that, out of context, seem laughable to those who aren't triggered by them, but remind them in some way of their traumatic experience and can trigger anything from an uncomfortable sensation to a full-blown flashback of the event. To make things worse, people with this kind of trigger will sometimes experience belittlement if they dare to disclose it. Worse is the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteIsEverywhere">Kryptonite Is Everywhere</a>; people could understand if a loud bang causes someone who'd been in a war zone to flash back to a bomb strike, but what if a certain enemy vehicle sounded a lot like a certain civilian one, or someone was holding a cup of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/McDonalds">McDonald's</a> coffee just before the worst attack they'd lived through? Suddenly a car in need of a tune-up or a cup of coffee on a table is Kryptonite to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel Badass</a> who eats nails for breakfast. One could also easily imagine a person who has suffered abuse needing to, say, not watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> if they'd been molested. But some could watch it all day, and then the mailman comes by wearing the same brand and color of shoes their abuser preferred.
</li><li> Diabetics have sugar. Too much AND too little.
</li><li> Despite being touted as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm">Ultimate Life Form</a>, Cockroaches have a few. Their biggest one is temperature, many species will outright die if they aren't kept within a narrow range of temperatures. The ones that don't die usually can't reproduce in mild hot or cold conditions. The reason they've become such an infamous pest is that temperatures they tolerate happen to be the same range that humans prefer.
</li><li> Albinos have sunlight. A couple of other disorders too, including xeroderma pigmentosum.
</li><li> The RIAA came up with a brilliant new method for encrypting data on CDs, which works fine on PC computers, but not on Macintoshes. <a class="urllink" href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/02/05/14/0040215/post-it-notes-vs-copy-inhibited-cds">It can be negated by drawing a circle on the CD with permanent marker.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Optical discs themselves (especially those which have two shiny sides) have a Weaksauce Weakness - simple tape. If one pastes tape or a label on the front of some discs, then decides to remove the tape or label, the adhesive <em>peels off the data-containing foil layer</em>, rendering the disc unusable. This is because the disc has almost nothing between the foil and the label side of the disc. The fact that the disc is shiny on the label side as well as the data side shows that the disc has no protective label printed onto it, only a thin layer of plastic that is easily removed. In fact, any optical disc is much more likely to be ruined from the label side than the data side because of the thinness of that side, even with a factory-printed label.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://phobialist.com/">Phobias<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in general can be like this for those who suffer from them; they cause crippling, irrational panic at the slightest indication of the feared objects. Worse, being irrational after all, the object doesn't even have to be objectively frightening. Most of us can probably understand why people would be afraid of spiders, or snakes, or heights, but imagine having a phobia of flowers, buttons, or peanut butter? (Imagine it too hard and you'll get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">phobophobia</a>...)
</li><li> Laser weapons that are starting to be used by the US military can be thwarted by such phenomena as dust, sand, bad weather, clouds, smoke, steam, etc. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a> put it, it's a good thing they're not planning on using it in regions that have above-mentioned problems, or if Iran develops sand technology.
</li><li> People can pass out by locking their knees for too long. This isn't normally a problem, but people who have to stand still for long periods of time, such as people in the army, marching band, or choir, have to make sure to bend their knees occasionally.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EekAMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EekAMouse">Elephants are afraid of mice</a>. At least in cartoons. The scientific jury is still undecided whether this has a sound real-life basis or whether it is just an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legend</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a></em> tested it and found it confirmed: elephants will actively avoid mice if at all possible. Though it's not specifically mice so much as it is wariness at something smaller than an elephant's poor eyesight can reliably identify, to them it could be a snake or something else potentially threatening-the Mythbusters test was done by suddenly revealing white domestic mice to wild elephants, who would have only ever experienced a sidden flash of white color low to the ground as the warning signal of a disturbed cobra. They could also simply be aware of their surroundings and give the small quick moving creature a wide berth to avoid stepping on it.
</li><li> Tin foil can easily destroy a microwave oven.
</li><li> Microwaves can interfere with Wi-Fi signals, as can anything else on the 2.4 Ghz spectrum, including other Wi-Fi networks.
</li><li> The MLB has starting pitcher Jon Lester. He's a three-time World Series winner, four-time All-Star, and a perennial Cy Young candidate. Only <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cblrlzIxxfY">he<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWM_rGr7A0w">has<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sls10cwh6tw">some<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_6Mvx6bQ5g">trouble<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> throwing to first base. Other players have had this problem at some point in their careers, such as pitchers Matt Young and Matt Garza, and second basemen Steve Sax and Chuck Knoblauch; catcher Mackey Sasser uniquely developed trouble throwing the ball back to the pitcher accurately. The term used for this in baseball is "The Yips."
</li><li> Dogs (and likely wolves and coyotes) are hypersensitive to theobromine, a relative of caffeine that exists in cocoa and chocolate. Hence significant amounts of chocolate, except for white chocolate, can be deliciously tempting death to them. Although it is possible for other animals, including humans and rats to be poisoned by theobromine, they only realistically run into problems with it from huge amounts or from very dark or pure forms (like cocoa mulch and cacao shells and nibs), and elephants, mice, rats, and humans delight in eating chocolate safely. One kind animal that can be realistically poisoned by milk chocolate much like a dog however is the parrot.
</li><li> Dogs are extremely sensitive to xylitol, which ferrets and rabbits can, but rarely have problems with and that humans, cats, and other animals can pretty much consume in normal amounts safely without a hitch. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0snao');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0snao" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0snao');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fruits and vegetables technically have xylitol in them, it is just not in the same deadly-to-dogs form or amount that is present in sugar free gum.</span>
</li><li> The Ferdinand (Elefant) tank destroyer — which was based on the chassis of rejected Porsche-designed Tiger I tanks — was quite impressive on paper, boasting extraordinarily thick frontal armour and a powerful gun capable of punching through any Allied tank fielded during the war. However, because of Ferdinand Porsche's penchant for toying with experimental technology it used a novel petro-electric drive for its transmission, which allowed for more precise steering and high-speed reversing, but was prone to overheating and catching on fire under the slighest amount of overexertion. Compounding the problem was that Elefant was horribly overweight, moreso than the rather husky Henschel-designed Tiger I.
</li><li> Digital terrestrial television offers clear pictures without the expense of cable or satellite service—as long as you're within range of the broadcasting tower with a properly adjusted antenna. An improperly oriented antenna or weak signal will cause a TV picture to break up like a scratched DVD, where in the analog days you would have a snowy picture but still be able to make out the scene. This is known as the "digital cliff effect". This can be especially annoying for people in countries that have discontinued analog terrestrial TV broadcasting.
</li><li> Some things which are harmless to humans are poisonous to other life-forms. Silver is deadly poisonous to most microorganisms (as for why they don't make surgical instruments out of silver: it's too soft and doesn't keep its edge.)
</li><li> Enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeeAfraid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeeAfraid">bee stings</a> can kill anyone, even if they aren't allergic. So called "killer bees" are the same species as normal honeybees, but are far more aggressive, hence them killing people.
</li><li> Programming/coding. Just one missing or extra symbol is enough to make your program fail. Either it will fail at compile time, in which case most compilers will at least helpfully (or not) point out the mistake...or it compiles, only for it to execute in ways you did not intend, and you look through hundreds, maybe thousands, of lines of code to see what you did wrong, and then plant your palm on your forehead because you had an extra semicolon at line 500.
