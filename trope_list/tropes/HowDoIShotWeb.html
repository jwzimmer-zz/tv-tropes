<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlameOfRecca">Flame of Recca</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Tournament Arc</a>, One opponent managed to steal one of Recca's flame dragons. However, he had no idea which one out of Recca's eight dragons he acquired (he was hoping to get the most powerful one). This guy manages to acquire a one-eyed dragon named Setsuna who, as told by one of Recca's other dragons, is quite powerful but a rather disobedient dragon. When the opponent tries to sic Setsuna on Recca, the very annoyed dragon promptly asks why the hell he should listen to some new guy and fried him in response.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMiniBossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMiniBossSquad">Quirky Mini Boss Squad</a> leader Captain Ginyu trades bodies with Goku. This is fairly ingenious, because he waited until he was weakened and nearly defeated by Goku before trading. To make it even better, he inflicted a severe wound to his own body (punching himself through the chest) immediately before making the switch. However, he couldn't get full power out of Goku's body, because he doesn't know his powerup technique, the Kaio-ken. Unfortunately for him, Vegeta then shows up and beats the snot out of him before he gets it to work. And then when he reverses the trick so he can try the same technique to body-jack Vegeta, the trick doesn't work twice; they throw a frog in the way.
</li><li> The same thing happens with Goku Black in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even though Zamasu was quite powerful after stealing Goku's body, he had no idea how to use Goku's abilities and only learned to do so after watching him in action.</span> Even later, as his power continues to grow, he rips a hole in reality. When Vegeta asks him what exactly he just did, Black shrugs and says he has no idea: his power has grown beyond his own understanding of it.
</li></ul></li><li> When Pist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyUnlimited">Final Fantasy: Unlimited</a></em> steals Kaze's Magun, the device that allows him to summon powerful beings using special bullets, he tries to use it himself (including a bizarre subversion of the normal firing sequence) but the resulting summon turns on him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>
<ul><li> The rambunctious Kamina steals the Gurren and, confident that he has access to new powers, attempts to combine with the Lagann as the head. It fails pathetically and hilariously. They eventually get it to work through determination.
</li><li> Similarly, Simon has a few issues with Lagann's systems at first, especially the jet thruster. Quoth Yoko: "Ah, hello? We're sorta falling..."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> Lelouch instinctively knows the basic principle behind the Geass, (leading to the iconic "Lelouch vi Britannia commands you... Die!" scene) but he doesn't know all the specifications, and after a couple of mishaps, he takes on the task of testing it to figure out <em>exactly</em> what it can and can't do. The fifth episode shows just how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> he is by that point by having him rattle off all the things he's learned via experimentation, such as its maximum effective range of 270 meters. The audio commentary lampshades this when the voice actors (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunFukuyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JunFukuyama">Lelouch's</a>) muse on exactly <em>how</em> he discovered these things, suggesting (for the range example) that he used cell phones in walkie-talkie fashion.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Prequel stories</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em> show the original HOMRA trio figuring out their powers this way in Izumo's bar, after Mikoto first awakens as the Red King and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperEmpowering">makes the other two his Clansmen</a>. So if you were wondering why Izumo had to replace the bar...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>
<ul><li> There's a sequence involving Light Yagami learning the rules and limitations of the Death Note before he embarks on his great scheme of moral cleansing. He continues to experiment with its powers and devise loopholes throughout the series. By the end of episode three, he knows more about the thing than Ryuk, a shinigami.
</li><li> The Yotsuba executives also learn some of its rules this way, for instance, giving someone a death condition that is physically impossible will result in that person simply dying of a heart attack. The Death Note's owner, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Higuchi</span>, actually <em>does</em> understand the rules, but has to avoid revealing them openly to hide his identity.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GateKeepers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GateKeepers">Gate Keepers</a></em>, Ukiya Shun is blessed by the Gate of Wind. It took him several episodes just to properly summon the power again (which he did in the first episode on instinct), and an episode testing a new technique (which he later perfects).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>
<ul><li> The manga has Tsukune kidnapped by a shapeshifter, who copies his form and goes out to fight Tsukune's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a>. Unfortunately, the fellow runs into quite a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb">How Do I Shot Web?</a> moments as he tries (in vain) to kill them, not realizing that he's far, far weaker than they are in human form.

He doesn't learn how to fire it at will until he reaches Bankai. Much plot with Ichigo concerns the fact he has great power, but no real clue how to control it. His sword is mocked explicitly for being a "Big ball of fluff".
</li><li> It got even worse when Ichigo unlocked <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his Fullbring</span>. At least with a sword you know that the basic goal is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">stick the stabby end into the bad people</a>, but how the heck are you supposed to fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a giant glowing swastika</span>?
</li><li> And now yet another ability has come out in this way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ichigo's about to get his throat carved out, and suddenly manifests Blut Vene... a <em>Quincy</em> defensive technique that blocks the attack.

They have to learn how to summon their powers at will (with fairly amusing results at first, especially when Chad tries to remember what Ichigo's younger sister Karin looks like), although Orihime manages to improve to the point where she can use her Shun Shun Rikka without calling their names. In the Bount Arc, Uryu has these issues with the artifact that he uses to fight without his powers.

The reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">this didn't apply to Ichigo</a> was because (1) his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> intervened for a while, (2) although he lacked much control over it, his bankai had more than enough <em>raw power</em> to compensate, and (3) it's unusual in that his power is turned <em>inward</em>, meaning there's no new techniques or whatever to master: just everything he already knows cranked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.

The first time they tried to take off, the anti-grav units broke free of the ship. Using the fold system left them millions of miles off-course, surrounded by <em>inhabited bits of the island</em> they folded near, and the fold engine <em>disappeared</em>. The first time they transformed the <em>Macross</em>, they destroyed the entire city inside the ship.

It nearly destroyed the ship.
<ul><li> Humorously, this is also why they survived so long against the Zentraedi attacks: whenever they pulled one of these stunts, the Zentraedi commanders were unsure of whether the humans <em>meant</em> to do that or not, and therefore wonder what <em>other</em> tricks they must have up their sleeves, leading to an overly-cautious approach on their part.

However when they learn their third spell, which magnetizes their opponent, Kiyomaro tries several unsuccessful attempts to test this spell (which he didn't know the effects of at the time), and eventually tried singing the incantation, very badly. Part of the punchline with the third spell was that he was casting it successful in his tests, just that since the spell is purely magnetic and he tested in a place with no metal around, the spell had nothing to effect. Happens again with the fourth spell as despite putting in emotion, the spell didn't work. They later learn that instead that spell works off of tension rather than will.

Unfortunately for her, half of the functions on the device are party tricks (and they're listed first in the instruction manual), and the other half are abilities that are useful, but only if used correctly, and Usopp may not have known how good they can be (he suggests playing boomerang catch with the Cyclone Tempo). Despite this, once she manages to find the right functions to use, she can win if she identifies the good moves and learns how to use them.

After the time skip it's largely a matter of not going berserk while using it, but pre-time skip his major problem is accessing the power to begin with. This led to a month of humiliating "training" in summoning tadpoles, culminating with being thrown into a ravine. And just to make it worse, when summoning really counts, he's only able to get a toad the size of his hand. Twice! Course at the time Orochimaru had hit him with a sealing spell which was throwing his Chakra out of balance. By the time Jiraya had removed that handicap, it was only a few days before Naruto had to fight in the second Chunin tournament, so he really didn't have any time to master it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inu-Yasha didn't even knew about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Tetsusaiga's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">Kaze no Kizu / Wind Scar</a> when he first got it. It took some time until he learned about it, more time to use it accidentally, even more time to use it at will and even more time to truly master it. When he gains a new power in his sword, he has to learn how to use it. Like the Wind Scar, the Dragon-Scale Tessaiga was something he struggled desperately to master and, in both situations, something his brother said was what started him on the road to mastering the power (in the case of the Wind Scar, his brother's help was accidental, in the case of the Dragon-Scale, his brother's help was deliberate, if not cryptic). In both cases, the main lesson for Inuyasha wasn't what the powers could do (which only had limited functionality) but what he could achieve when he believed in himself as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-demon</a>.
</li><li> Sesshoumaru has the ability to instantly master any weapon, especially swords. He even knows how to master swords he hasn't even touched (such as Inuyasha's Dragon-Scale Tessaiga). However, when Tenseiga gained the Meidou Zangetsuha power, Sesshoumaru struggled to master the ability. When he did finally master the ability (after a humiliating encounter with an old enemy of his father), he realized that he wasn't meant to keep the power and passed it on to Inuyasha instead. It was the only sword power in the entire story that required a compassionate heart to master instead of fighting/weapon skill or instinct, and the lesson for Sesshoumaru was that he should never wield a sword without feeling fear at the possibility of losing loved ones or without feeling compassion for even his enemies.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> manga, Kouji can't control Mazinger-Z when he first gets it and is forced to have Sayaka run out in the Aphrodite A to stop him and get him under control. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaiser</a></em> OVA takes it one step further: Kouji thinks he can control it, but it takes control of him then goes into a berserker rage.

Though, it's starting to seem like the rest of Miyuki's teammates are stuck in this same predicament.

Of course, he still had to learn how to use them, and after several years was only able to use one, the spear, effectively. He eventually learns to fire more than one shot with the gun, and comes closer to mastering the shield with training from its original owner (who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>). With foresight he learned to work around the axe's twelve-second materialization time, and over time got better at the sword bit by bit if nowhere near able to master it. In fact, when the series was cut short at twelve volumes, Beet still arguably hadn't totally mastered <em>any</em> of his weapons!

Later, he uses them by instinct during a life-or-death situation. The next episode has him trying to train to use them at will, which doesn't go anywhere. It is triggered by his will to protect others. Later on in the manga it's explained that the Twelve Families traditionally only passed on the knowledge of how their powers work through oral tradition, and since Yuuto's family didn't teach him the family secrets before they died, he honestly has no clue how the Light Ferry works, and there's nothing and no one he can consult for lessons. He has to rediscover all his family's techniques from scratch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>, the reason why Louise seems to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneptMage">Inept Mage</a> is because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her affinity is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid">Void Magic</a>, a long forgotten art</span>. Once she learns this, she becomes much more effective when she figures out the kinks. Saito's power is to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert">Instant Expert</a> with any weapon, but it takes him a while to realize that it only works with real weapons. He tries to use an ornamental sword and gets his ass kicked. He also needs to be in a real fight, as when he tried to twirl a sword around to show off, he made a fool of himself.
<ul><li> Above example is anime only. In the original light novels, Saito is capable of wielding the ornamental weapon as if it were any other and the activation of his abilities was merely dependent on being in contact with a weapon. The ornamental weapon was still meant to be a weapon, it just broke the first time Saito used it because it wasn't durable enough to withstand being used to strike stone by someone of Saito's strength. The trope is still played straight with Saito's combat abilities, though. He can swing a sword like a natural and gains incredible speed and strength, but it takes him some time and a fair bit of practice to be able to fully get a good head for actual combat.

It took both of them quite some time to even realize their bodies weren't their old bodies any more, nevermind figuring out they had beyond-human capabilities. Shishigami adapts and discovers his capabilities quicker, because of his youth and being a fan of superhero manga. Inuyashiki on his end needs a lot of motivation and help to reach the same level because he didn't really want to become a hero in the first place.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> The mainline Spider-Man actually subverts the trope. Many of his powers are hardwired into his reflexes and instincts. As such, acrobatics, fighting, dodging bullets, and balancing are all things he can do automatically. In his introduction, he backflipped twenty feet and stuck to the side of a building mere minutes after being bitten by the radioactive spider, purely because his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiderSense">Spider-Sense</a> sensed a car about to run him over. Even web-slinging needed little practice purely because his reflexes prevented him from screwing up. Spidey's biggest problem tends to be the fact that his opponents are stronger and faster than him and/or have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">"Instant Death" Radius</a> that requires him to be smart about using his powers.
</li><li> Spidey also had no trouble figuring out how to shoot webs because it isn't actually one of his powers! That's right, Peter Parker actually designed some web fluid and shooters using his awesome powers of nerdiness. At least, not until the times in the comics when he (temporarily) <em>does</em> get natural webbing.
</li><li> However, he did have a minor problem when his Spider-Sense got burnt out — without it, web-swinging was much tougher as he has no way of knowing what's safe to swing on or not.
</li><li> This trope is used occasionally in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> comic: most egregiously, when Peter Parker startles out of daydreams in school and breaks his desk <em>multiple times</em> without anyone becoming unduly suspicious about it. Public school chairs... The most hilarious use of this trope is when Wolverine and Spider-Man switch bodies. Wolverine's attempts to learn how to websling must be seen to be believed.
</li><li> Played straight with Miguel O'Hara, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan2099" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan2099">Spider-Man 2099</a>. Many of the events in the first three issues of his comic are of him learning how to use his new abilities, such as retractable talons, heightened vision, and — yes — shooting webs.
</li><li> The new Spider-Man Miles Morales originally did not shoot web, but eventually receives his own web shooters and learns how. It takes him a couple of tries before he gets the hang of swinging without smacking against a wall or onto a rooftop. Meanwhile, his best friend and unofficial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>, Ganke Lee, faces the conundrum of "How Do I <em>Make</em> Web?", since it was the late Peter Parker's secret formula and he has to reverse engineer the web fluid so Miles can continually use it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a> didn't exactly have problems learning to use her powers, but she needed training from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">father</a> and his friend Phil Urich to really be able to master them and become a more experienced fighter.
</li><li> Similarly, Phil Urich himself had a number of problems figuring out how to use the Green Goblin's equipment when he moonlighted as a superhero in the short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenGoblin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenGoblin">Green Goblin</a></em> series Marvel published in the 1990s. Later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, he knew how to fly the ship the mysterious benefactor gave Phil's group because it was based on the Goblin equipment.
</li><li> Spider-Man's ally and generally lovable loser the Fabulous Frog-Man. Stealing the fully automated frog-suit of his father, the villainous Leapfrog, Eugene Patilio wholeheartedly attempts to make a difference while being utterly clueless about how the suit works. This proves to be his greatest strength, however, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool">his frequent misfired jumps tend to knock out waves of bad guys</a> and make him look like a real hero who knows what he's doing. Pretty much the only person who knows that Eugene is a bumbler in person is Spidey himself.
</li></ul></li><li> The short "untold" story of young Peter Parker called "The Punch!" from the Amazing Spider-Man Family Volume 1 issue 3 partially uses this trope for his super strength (his other powers subvert this trope). It takes place after Uncle Ben died and Peter decides to make Spider-Man a hero. He stops a robber by punching them with what he calls a "tap". However, Peter couldn't actually control his strength and the robber nearly <em>died</em> had to be rushed to the hospital. Peter than goes to an abandoned building and lets loose to see just how strong he is. He wrecks the place and is shaking with fear over the amount of strength he has. He almost quits being Spider-Man because of it but realizes it is a good thing when it allows him to hold up a falling crane long enough for all the bystanders to get to safety. The story actually doesn't show how Peter learned to control his strength (just that he'll learn over time). Also, one has to wonder how Spider-Man not even trying nearly killed someone and yet Uncle Ben's killer didn't die.
</li><li> The Super-Skrull is a recurring <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> villain who can use all the super-powers of that team, plus has a native alien ability to shapeshift. Nevertheless, he is always defeated, usually by the Four's ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">work as a team</a>. It's been explain in canon that one of the reasons he loses to the FF is that some of them have gotten upgraded (either explicitly or via Power Drift) since he was created. For example Sue Richards wasn't the most powerful member of the team when they copied her, so her powers are stronger than the Super Skrull's. The Thing and Johnny Storm also had power ups. Reed has stayed the same, but his real power is his brain and he is indeed smarter than Super Skrull. It must be noted that Sue Storm's original power, that is, the one copied by Super Skrull, is the power to turn invisible (at the time, Sue was called "Invisible Girl"), which at the time was roughly the weakest, dumbest and most feeble excuse for a power in the Marvel universe. Her power upgrade (which Super Skrull <em>does not</em> have access to) is <em>the ability to create invisible force fields of any shape or size at will.</em> This upgrade ended up making her one of the single most powerful (and shitfire lethal) mortals in the Marvel universe. In other words, Super Skrull's stolen powers are one-fourth <em>wildly obsolete.</em> <br/><br/>Another factor is that <em>no one</em> understands the FF's powers better than the FF themselves, so they know exactly how to counter them. On the other hand, the Super-Skrull is shown to be <em>extremely</em> effective when fighting other enemies, since he's ruthless enough to use his powers in ways the FF never would, like stretching parts of his body into razor wire to decapitate enemy soldiers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Xavin</a>, another Skrull with similar abilities, can barely use more than one power at a time. Although in the <em>Secret Invasion</em> tie-in, it was shown that while Xavin can only use one power at a time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGenderIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGenderIdentity">s/he</a> became better at using them individually than his teacher could. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em>, it is revealed that the Skrulls now have the idea to copy <em>any</em> superhuman's powers, appearance, and memory perfectly. As revealed in the sub-series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a></em>. (written by the same dude), they really, really worked very, very hard at it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>
<ul><li> The Justice League suffered a multiple bodyswap in the TPB <em>Foreign Bodies</em>; a female villain called Psykosis was incited to do it by Kobra. It ended up with Kyle Rayner (Green Lantern) operating the body of J'onn J'onzz, J'onn taking over Aquaman's body, Aquaman in temporary possession of Wonder Woman's body, Wonder Woman in Psykosis' body, Psykosis' psyche in Flash's body, Flash in Steel's body, and Steel in Green Lantern's body. Separate to this, Superman and Batman had simply swapped bodies <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or so it seemed; in actuality, Batman was indeed in Superman's body, but Kobra had taken command of Batman's body, leaving Superman resident in Kobra's body</span>. And boy howdy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity did indeed ensue</a> at nearly everyone's expense before it was over. Worth noting that Batman gets an <em>immediate</em> grasp on Superman's powers, and starts saving the day worldwide. Only, he laments that so much power is <em>distracting</em>.
</li><li> In <em>JLA: Year One</em>, everyone's powers (and their related body parts) are stolen by a villain. He seems to instantly know how to work each individual power, but the villain primarily relies on Green Lantern's ring, the flashiest and most "powerful" of the abilities. By overlooking the benefits of each different power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLooksLikeAJobForAquaman">Aquaman is able to overpower and kick his ass.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>
<ul><li> Subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a> origin story of the Hal Jordan Green Lantern, <em>Emerald Dawn</em>. In this story, Jordan stumbles about with his newly bestowed power ring, barely defeats a powerful villain and realizes that he is out of his depth with the weapon. To solve that problem, Jordan asks the ring if there is another member of the Green Lantern Corps he can talk to for help. The ring whisks him away to meet Tomar-Re, who recommends that Jordan come to GLC headquarters on the planet Oa for the optional training program. Jordan, naturally, takes that advice.
</li><li> This appears to have been retconned somewhat in the new <em>Secret Origin</em> of Hal Jordan. Hal gets the ring and uses it to fly and make a few constructs without much difficulty, but is not aware of the full functional capacity of the ring. He is then forcibly brought to OA for <em>mandatory</em> training.
</li><li> When Mongul steals a yellow power ring, the first thing he does is order the ring to tell him <em>everything</em> it can do, then spends 96 hours practicing before using it for supervillainy. It fails to mention the administrative override Sinestro builds into each ring.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>
<ul><li> Was actually a major theme of the original 1960s <em>X-Men</em>, and still appears at times. It could easily be argued that this trope is the basis for the X-Men as a whole, as the series has <em>always</em> revolved around a group of mutants who are <em>being trained in the use of their own powers</em> at what is quite literally a school that exists for precisely that purpose.
</li><li> Inverted with Rogue, who can use her powers quite well, but doesn't know how to turn them off (it's been pretty much spelled out that she <em>could</em> control them, except that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">some serious psychological trauma</a> concerning both her power's first use and the effects of continued use were serving as a block.)
</li><li> Subverted with Wing from Astonishing X-Men who tells Hisako (Armor) that after discovering that he could fly without propulsion, he assumed that this meant he was invincible as well and landed with a little too much force, breaking both of his legs.
</li><li> An old <em>X-Men</em> villain was Mimic, a mutant who can copy up to 5 different mutants' powers. These powers become permanent if he can be around them for at least an hour. He was usually defeated due to three reasons; his copied powers were only 1/2 as strong as the original, he had no experience in using them, and he was kinda dumb. Eventually he got smarter (and did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>), and now has the original 5 X-Men's powers permanently (though only at the level of their teenage years; this is still formidable because he can use all 5 simultaneously, but it would've been downright game-breaking if he had the power-ups they've all gotten). He can also mimic an additional power on top of those 5, but trying more than that would be dangerous to him.
</li><li> An AU Mimic becomes team leader in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Exiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Exiles">Exiles</a></em>. This version had joined the X-Men and had spent years developing and mastering his plethora of powers and becoming a champion of mutants. His "main" powers for most of the comics run were Flight (Angel), Invulnerability (Colossus; couldn't fly in steel form), super agility (Beast), energy projection (Cyclops), and healing (Wolverine). Even with years of practice copying others Mimic admits that he wouldn't be stupid enough to try and copy a shapeshifter or teleporter for fear of accidentally killing himself.
</li><li> Nate Grey a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan">X-Man</a> (who, ironically, was only rarely a member of the X-Men) suffered from this on a grand scale early on, something compounded by the fact that his in-built genetic degeneration meant he suffered from often explosive and entirely random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a>. He was competent enough in a fight, and had some very unusual tricks (like using his telekinesis to create an electromagnetic pulse) thanks to tutelage from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">his reality's</a> version of Forge, but he mostly learned by a) making it up as he went along, and b) using his telepathy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaManning">copy techniques</a>. However, the difference between the kid who could barely outfight Dark Beast and the powerhouse who used the multiverse as his personal stepladder, treated death as a minor inconvenience, effortlessly flattened several teams of X-Men while simultaneously keeping Apocalypse prisoner and Magneto on a psychic leash, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfXMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfXMan">created his own reality</a></em> is astounding.
</li></ul></li><li> The trope is very logically subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em> when the team tracks down Alchemy, a mutant whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PubertySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PubertySuperpower">Puberty Superpower</a> is the ability to transmute any matter into a simple element like gold. He was kidnapped by trolls and had to defend himself by transforming their leaders. He then couldn't change them back because he has to imagine the totality of the matter he is changing something into, and organic matter is so complex on a molecular level that he can't do it. So, he goes off for the advanced education in biochemistry needed to cure the beings he has affected.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2x0vv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2x0vv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2x0vv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One rather odd part of that story was that Alchemy refused to join X-Factor's school for mutants because it wasn't training in his powers but training in advanced organic chemistry that he needed. This was entirely true, but apparently the writers forgot that one of X-Factor's members was the most accomplished biochemist on Earth.</span> By the time Alchemy reappeared in the pages of <em>Excalibur</em>, he had gotten enough education and control over his power that he was able to restore the humans he had inadvertently transformed after the trolls had kidnapped him again to try and force him to change their leaders back to normal.

</li><li> In an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>, the villain Absorbing Man absorbs the android Vision's ability to become intangible. He promptly falls through the pier he's standing on and into the water, due to a lack of control.

She joins the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BPRD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BPRD">B.P.R.D.</a> because they can teach her how to use her powers, or at the very least have ways to keep her from hurting people again.

As Empowered has the self-confidence of a used kleenex in a dirty cesspool, you can see how it works. So yes, she unconsciously granted herself the power of being easily aroused and multi-orgasming. Kudos!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em>
<ul><li> Way back in <em>Tales of Suspense</em> #39, when Tony Stark first put on his first Iron Man armor to escape from a Vietnamese prison camp, he takes one step in his armor and falls flat on his face.
</li><li> In <em>Iron Man</em> #200, Obadiah Stane puts on his brand-new baby, the Iron Monger suit, to fight Tony (wearing his brand-new Silver Centurion armor), because he <em>knows</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">it's Tony coming after him</a>. However, Stane has no experience, so he has to rely on a remote computer to assist him in the fight. When Stark realizes this (as he's been detecting strange transmissions throughout their fight), he destroys the building that's been transmitting to Stane's suit, leaving Stane outmatched.
</li><li> Averted with Iron Man's first match with Firepower in #230, as Jack Taggert's been training extensively on a simulator, and the real suit's capabilities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">totally overwhelm Iron Man</a>.

In fact, he scarred his immediate superior's face while trying to escape after stealing the suit to begin with. Later, after he became a cadet at Camp Hammond in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersTheInitiative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersTheInitiative">Avengers: The Initiative</a></em>, he discovers he can <em>grow</em> in size, too (with the possible limitation of this only happening in response to a threat posed by someone else turning giant with Pym Particles).
</li><li> In Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a></em>, teenage spellcaster Asgardian (later Wiccan) is shown to have difficulty using his powers. His boyfriend, Hulkling, helps him learn to control them with ordinary self-help books.

It took a while for him to control his flight, much less realize he could steer himself and get any good at it. Luckily for him, he's physically invulnerable while "blasting" (and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">possibly immortal, depending on which retcon they're on at the moment</span>), so he could always walk away from a crash. This was also the case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nova">Nova</a></em> to some extent, in the early issues of his first series; he could fly at supersonic speeds, but sometimes couldn't turn or stop in time to keep from crashing into things, particularly during a fight. Writer/creator Marv Wolfman also mentioned more than once (through other characters) that Nova had powers that he was completely unaware of; later series would eventually reveal these.

<ul><li> The second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, inherited the magical <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(or, as it much later transpires, alien tech)</span> scarab that powered his predecessor's superhuman abilities — but couldn't figure out how to make it work for him. He never did — which didn't stop him from having a long heroic career as the Beetle under his own steam.
</li><li> The <em>third</em> Beetle (Jaime Reyes), incidentally, gets along with the scarab like a house on fire. It just didn't take to Ted. It's implied by the scarab that the reason it didn't work for him is because he hung around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> too much, supposedly because of being exposed to too much of his "multiverse energy".

He discovered some of his other powers while experimenting and training with Megala, and discovered others as time went on. What's particularly interesting about this case is that there may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">no actual limit to his powers</a>, but he only gradually discovers this. Of course, many writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">remember or forget the extent of Cap's powers</a> as is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">convenient for the plot</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Powers">Powers</a></em> does this a lot, starting in the very first issue where a powers specialist police pathologist rants at length about the fact he <em>has no idea how to do his job</em> and has to retrain himself every day because every single powers operates on his or her own uniquely altered biology and there's no frame of reference for anything that they do. At least one hero meets an early end to his career when he kills a bystander while trying to figure out how to fly.
</li><li> The heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostDarkHorseComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostDarkHorseComics">Ghost</a></em> took some time to learn to manage her intangibility: how not to walk through her garments; how not to drift while sleeping and wake up deep underground.

The last one he had no idea how it worked and it seemingly came when he was in a panic. After learning he had Tactile Telekinesis (which allowed him to mimic Superman's abilities to a point), he started focusing more and using it a lot better. Then came the <em>rest</em> of his Kryptonian powers, like his heat vision, which first manifested in accidentally singing Superman's cape (he wasn't happy about that.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Paperinik</a> examples:
<ul><li> Paperinik sometimes has troubles with his gadgets, both in PKNA and non-PKNA stories. It's downplayed in PKNA, given he has One to help him with those (but still doesn't know how to use the full potential of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon">Extransformer shield</a>, and when One gets deactivated he finds out he has no idea how to fuel the PKar... Or what the fuel <em>is</em>), but in non-PKNA stories he has some added problems because Gyro either forgets to explain how they work or gives him a <em>gigantic</em> user manual he cannot possibly read.
<ul><li> Actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> in the non-PKNA story in which the Beagle Boys stole his 313-X car and some of his weapons... Only to get repeteadly humiliated because Paperinik knows how to use them and they don't (the paralizing pistol, for example, is single-shot).
</li></ul></li><li> In her debut, Paperinika had some serious problems at using her skating boots, and the first attempt ended with a ridiculous pratfall. Averted for the other gadgets, as her supplier has the common sense to explain how to use the things and provide sensibly-sized user manuals... Or simply provides gadgets that are based on something she already knows how to use (such as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BikerBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BikerBabe">bike</a>).
</li><li> Xadhoom's powers, originating from an artificial mutation, are the centre of multiple instances:
<ul><li> When she first showed up, Xadhoom had no problems at using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGoddess">godlike powers</a>, but she once mentioned it took a while to actually learn how to use them. She also didn't learn her minor shape-shifting abilities could allow her to recover her pre-mutation looks until she pulled it by accident, and continued learning some new use of her powers until her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.
</li><li> Before dying, Xadhoom created a copy of her memory that included the process of how to get the powers. The Belgravian government promptly steals part of the data... And, not understanding what it actually was, tried to make a volcano-controlling superweapon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">triggering an eruption only on the volcanic island where their lab was located</a>.
</li><li> Later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zoster</span> succeeds in stealing the copy and being told by Xadhoom's holographic double how to replicate the process, and had the common sense to listen <em>everything</em>. He carefully replicates the process on himself, gets the powers... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumOverload" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumOverload">And is promptly disintegrated because he didn't have the self-control to hold them back, nor knew he needed it</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out Xadhoom created the memory to kill one last Evronian in such a way to make sure they wouldn't know if she's really dead, so they would leave the Xerbians alone...

By the start of the second book, months of expert tutelage and an intuitive knack mean that he's got pretty good control of his powers, but even then, he psychically traumatises half the planet when trying to replicate the psychic cry for help he unconsciously let out at the start of the first book, fracturing Blindfold's sanity in the process.

However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he relies heavily on a targeting computer; when Iron Man disables that, he quickly proves unable to hit him with missiles from about ten feet away. Nor does Stane know about the dangers of his armor freezing up if he flies too high, a problem Iron Man had already dealt with earlier in the film and that he now exploits when Stane makes the same mistake he did. His proficiency is somewhat justified in that the Iron Monger suit was designed as a mass produced weapon that Stane could later sell to the military; it's implied that it's designed to be very easy to use as opposed to the specifically calibrated Iron Man suit Stark has.</span>
</li><li> Stark didn't have much trouble operating his original "escape" suit either, despite not having much — or any — practice with it (but he designed and programmed it, so he knew how it was <em>supposed</em> to respond). Since Stane's suit is just a bigger and beefier copy of Stark's original plans, presumably there was something about the original design that made it fairly idiot-proof. That said, the entirety of the Mk. 1 suit's armaments were a flamethrower, a manually-fired missile, fists and a manual start rocket boost. The flamethrower requires next-to-no aiming capacity and the missile <em>missed</em>... thank goodness for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamage">Splash Damage</a>. Meanwhile Stark couldn't stop himself from constantly adding upgrades and modifications that certainly would have made his own suit more complex and fiddly.

Most of it is pure instinct, even without his knowledge early on (towards the end of the first trilogy, he even says that he still doesn't know how to <em>use</em> it, but he's figured out how to <em>trigger</em> it ... which basically amounts to putting himself in mortal danger and relying on the wild magic itself and/or his own subconscious to save him). It's not until the second trilogy that we see him directing it toward definite purposes, complete with a training regimen... he uses his wild magic to shave, precisely to teach himself control over it.
<ul><li> Technically, he still doesn't know how to turn it on. Instead, he had to learn to keep it under control due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lord Foul's venom acting as a permanent trigger</span>.

Notably, none of the characters become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantExpert">Instant Experts</a>, but have a learning curve of three or four books before they gain consistent control. Nyneave takes a full <em>seven</em> books to overcome her block.

Later, Nynaeve and Elayne hold another one hostage in order to learn lost techniques that have stayed lost for a good three millennia. Eventually, the Asha'man (a corps of male Channelers) are created an it was realized this trope could come into play.

Getting magic swords that can cut anything is great — for knights and swordmasters. For anyone else, it's a health risk.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em>: The first book has several amusing scenes of Kelsier teaching Vin about Allomancy and being a Mistborn. In particular, after he teaches her the basics of steel and iron (blue lines that connect to sources of metal), but says he'll explain the rest later, Vin's suspicious nature gets the better of her. She experimentally "tugs" on one of the blue lines, and yips and ducks as a loose nail shoots at her chest. Kelsier simply muses "I should have expected you to do that," then proceeds to explain Ironpulling and Steelpushing to her. Still takes her a bit to figure it out, though.
<ul><li> An unusually grand variant of this trope <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is what resulted in the world becoming an ash-blanketed wasteland a thousand years ago. The Lord Ruler received cosmic levels of power for a <em>very</em> limited amount of time and tried to stop the mists that were destroying civilisation. The power came with instinctive knowledge of how to use it to, say, move the planet closer to the sun to burn off the mists, but gave no information about the consequences of doing so or where the best place to put it would be. The Lord Ruler couldn't get the position right, and with limited time decided to move it too close to the sun, and then introduce a permanent nuclear winter to stop it overheating too much. He then realised plants and animals couldn't survive such a world, and frantically tried to adjust their biology to fit the new environment, with each change causing more problems until his power ran out.</span>

It's also been said repeatedly in-universe that truly mastering the art of magic takes decades of practice and diligence. For the first book and a half, Eragon's progress follows this trend, as he slowly progresses from struggling to lift a rock with his mind to effortlessly casting fire-based spells. Of course, then he undergoes a crash course in magic with the elves and then becomes half-elf during the Blood-Oath Ceremony, completely eliminating the need for a slow progression.
<ul><li> He's still learning clear through to the last book, but after the Blood-Oath Ceremony, it's less about how to use magic, and more about learning what he can accomplish with it.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the mutants in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gone">Gone</a></em> suffer from this, particularly Sam. Strangely, Caine and Diana have already figured out how to use their powers because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Evil Is Cool</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">Good Is Dumb</a>. Diana and Caine spent a while practicing their powers before coming down to Perdido Beach. It was said in the first book they'd had their powers for a couple months.
</li><li> <em>Shonsu</em> in <em>The Seventh Sword</em> trilogy, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveDuncan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveDuncan">Dave Duncan</a>, spends all three books learning to use the abilities given to him by a goddess. When he is first granted the abilities and knowledge to be the world's greatest swordsman, he has no idea. As the story progresses, he learns more and more about his capabilities, usually as the situations arise. This even applies to textbook-type knowledge, which actually works really well in the story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightside">Just Another Judgement Day</a></em>, there's a humorous scene at the Adventurer's Club when a wannabe supervillain with no clue how his (stolen) magic rings work accidentally teleports himself into the midst of a huge crowd of Nightside heroes, rather than into the neighboring club he'd intended to rob.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> builds this trope right into the setting. You've got magical powers? Great! You still have to go to school for seven years to learn how to use them. Both young Harry and Tom Riddle are able to occasionally "will" something to happen, but the effects are haphazard without training.
<ul><li> All young witches and wizards can use magic during times of stress or when feeling extreme emotions, though the effects are notoriously unpredictable (though they'll often reflect the emotion the kid's feeling; for instance, when Harry wanted to escape from Dudley and his friends, he apparated on top of the school chimney). It's shown that they can gain <em>some</em> control over it on their own, like Lily did as a kid, but to do anything functional and avoid losing control of their powers, they need schooling.

<div class="indent"><em>For a while, I thought I might be — or could be — a Jedi. But now I think that was just a fluke.

</li><li> British superhero drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em> really goes to town with this trope.

Both Kelly, who hates being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepathic</a> and wishes she could just turn it off, and Alisha, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">"power"</a> of pheromone manipulation — which causes anyone who touches her skin to experience such violent surges of lust that they will generally attempt to rape her — can do nothing to mitigate or restrain the effects of their powers. Curtis finds his power of time manipulation to be infuriatingly sporadic, and then there's Nathan, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whose power of Healing (and effective Immortality), works so incredibly slowly that it's possible for him to die, and only come back to life several days later — to find himself buried alive, naturally.</span> It is, however, a little early in the Series to deem them all <em>truly</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">power incontinent</a>.

The first time they get him to go invisible is by releazing tarantulas in a locked room with him. Considering Darien has arachnophobia (and his brother would know), this is a good way to trigger a massive generation of adrenalin necessary to activate the gland. When Darien tries to spy on a nurse and a soldier getting in on, his excitement causes his adrenalin levels to drop... and he gets a black eye from the pissed off soldier. Learning yoga helps control it. In another episode, Kevin Fawkes's RNA is injected into the gland in order to "revive" Kevin's ghost in Darien's body. Naturally, Kevin has to relearn how to use the gland.

First level sorcerers can create light or perhaps burn something with a bit of acid, but get more powerful with time. However, they are greatly limited in the variety of spells they can cast, as they have to figure them out themselves instead of learning them from scrolls or books.

It doesn't matter how many points are sunk in the former; a low score in the latter will result in someone struggling to activate their powers at all, let alone effectively.

After his defeat at Nibelheim, Sephiroth is inactive for 7 years, trapped in Mako until he returns with Jenova's powers.

Kite got off lightly, since his Twilight Bracelet can be used easily (with the catch that if he has too much viral infection, he'd, quite simply, die). No mishaps there (except player-induced). Haseo however, basically had to undergo a lot of training to obtain his Epitaph Power as Skeith. The first time he got it out, he nearly comatosed a group of people. Afterwards, he's inclined to pull this off to anyone that threatens him, comatose or no. Inevitably, he loses control of Skeith since he used it with such a reckless abandon.

</div></li><li> The constant bane of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> veterans is newbies who get levelled up too fast thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a> friends, and end up being very high level with absolutely no idea how to use any of their equipment or abilities, or the basic features of the game. Even worse are those who simply buy high level characters, literally hitting the level cap without ever having fought an enemy.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> players suffer from this trope particularly due to the sidekick system. A low level hero can be temporarily promoted to a high level so they can join a high level instance, but they do not gain any new powers, nor does it miraculously turn a new, low-level player into an experienced veteran.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> also has this apply to the ability to pay to change your talents, or buy an alternate set of talents. As such, players may be quite good at using their current talent tree, but may need some adjustment while switching to others, as a Warrior might be quite good at the DPS Arms tree, but not as good with Fury (which is also DPS), let alone tanking with Protection without quite a bit of practice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, the Palace of the Dead leads to this. The former lets players skip through most of the leveling process, meaning that they never learn proper rotations or, generally, how to play the class at all. Another option is through the game's cash shop, which offers so-called "Jump Potions" to allow someone to level up a class instantly to ten levels below the level cap. On a more far-reaching scale, when the <em>Shadowbringers</em> expansion came out, the developers redesigned how almost every class works. While the basics were still there, everyone who was reasonably invested in the game had to re-learn their classes in order to use them effectively.
<ul><li> Also due to the game allowing a single character to play any class or role, playing one class or role for a long enough time then switching to another can lead to this situation.
</li></ul></li><li> Another cause of this syndrome is a "Foundry" or similar system that lets players create their own content. Some will create easy "farming" missions that grant plenty of experience points with little "experience". This is especially prevalent in the aforementioned <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, with its Mission Architect system.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BreathOfFireIII">Breath of Fire III</a></em>, Ryu is born as a baby dragon, and his first few shapeshifts between human and dragon forms (which occur outside of actual combat) are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting">completely uncontrolled</a>. Although the player gains the ability to transform at will during battle, it is not until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">later</a>, when he reaches adulthood, that he has full control over his transformations.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em>. Samus always had the ability to walljump and shinespark, but learns to use it from the Zebes animals. When the SA-X appears in the latter title, while it never uses these techniques, it's explicitly stated the X parasites take knowledge from the host, so it stands to reason that it would know how to use them (by virtue of having infected Samus before). It may simply be that the Wall Jump and Shinespark are just impractical for the SA-X to use; the Wall Jump is rendered obsolete by its Space Jump ability, and the BSL station's tight quarters severely limits the usage of the Speed Booster/Shinespark.
</li><li> Bang Shishigami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlue">BlazBlue</a></em> was only told two things by Platinum; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that he had a Nox Nyctores, which are insanely powerful, and that its ability could very well save several people.</span> She didn't bother telling him though <em>what</em> it was and not even how to activate it.

He has a lot of psychic powers but doesn't know about them, until they manifest themselves by an appropriate challenge. For example, he finds himself tied to a cot and unable to get free. Suddenly, he realizes he can will the bonds to open and the door to unlock. He's also weak and hurt. He clutches his head... and suddenly feels better via psychic healing. A guard tries to stop him and threatens him with a gun. Once again, John gets a headache and fires a sphere of psychic energy at the guard that sends him flying across the room, breaking the guy's neck.

Reaches its ultimate conclusion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em> with Alien X, which is seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue">omnipotent</a>, but since Ben only gets to be one of its three personalities and the other two are constantly at odds with each other (the <em>only</em> thing they agree on is that they want Ben to provide tie-breaking votes for all their thousands of years worth of disagreements before they get to what <em>he</em> wants to do. And that they both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">hate Professor Paradox</a>), it's nearly impossible to get it to do <em>anything</em>. (It just stands perfectly still, stiff as a board, completely unresponsive to anything. Ben later learns that this is a serious problem, because he <em>can't turn back</em> until he can convince the other two entities to agree on it, effectively trapping him in the nonresponsive Alien X form.
</li><li> Same applies to Ben's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> Kevin 11, who instead of utilizing the full array of his Omnitrix powers (i.e. phasing, super-intelligence, super-speed, machine control) pretty much prefers to just either smash stuff or blast stuff. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a></em> Ben has to point out to him that he can phase through objects. He does get more creative in his power usage after realizing he's got so many different abilities, though.
</li><li> There's also the ever-constant problem of the Omnitrix not giving him the alien form that he desires. Acting like a puzzle of sorts akin to a tumbler lock, at first, Ben would quite often be transformed into an alien that he didn't want to be. He does get a little better over time, discovering new aliens altogether and their powers, but it still acts against him. Thanks to some guidance from the Omnitrix's creator (much to his constant frustration), Ben eventually does gain full control over the Omnitrix in <em>Alien Force</em>, even being able to transform at will by speaking the alien name or thinking it. He ends up saving the universe at the expense of overloading the Omnitrix, forcing him to relearn <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> he learned over the past few years about unlocking its powers. Even in <em>Omniverse</em>, he has almost complete control over it, but it still likes to screw him over every once in a while. He pretty much lampshades it when he wanted to transform into an alien that excels in physical strength, and gets turned into a Galvan (a small, froglike alien known for its brains, not brawn).
<div class="indent"><em>Sometimes I think this thing just plain hates me.</em>
</div></li><li> However, in <em>Omniverse</em>, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized">Flanderized</a> to the point that he almost <em>never</em> gets the alien he wanted. When he finally gets to confront the inventor over the supposedly upgraded version never working as intended, Azmuth tells him that he's just too rough on the controls (apparently, the way he dramatically slams his hand down on it to activate it before a battle is the culprit).
</li><li> Worse, <em>each</em> model has different ways of tormenting him:
<ul><li> In the original series, once transformed there was no switching aliens or changing back until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HourOfPower">Hour of Power</a> ended, and it would take quite some time for the Omnitrix to let him change again. Also, it sometimes gave him the wrong one.
</li><li> In <em>Alien Force</em>, there are no mistransformations, and he can change from alien to alien! The bad news is mistransformations are how new forms were unlocked - ten means ten now, PERIOD. In season three, he tampers with it to unlock more aliens (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Vilgax</a> is returning, after all.) and ends up making it play by original series rules, for better or worse (sometimes worse). He can still change from alien to alien, though.
</li><li> In <em>Ultimate Alien</em>, the Ultimatrix can make his aliens go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>... but there's still mistransformations, and it lacks some features the Omnitrix had, which he finds out about by <em>trying</em> to use them only to find out, no can do.
</li><li> In <em>Omniverse</em>, the new Omnitrix has every alien he's ever had! Too bad no matter who he tries to select, what he actually gets is apparently completely random. So is the time limit; he's stayed in the same alien form for extended battles, or had the Omnitrix last only a handful of seconds and not let him change again. Worse, when Khyber appeared who had a transforming alien dog with forms that were specifically geared to taking down some of Ben's specific forms, which aliens did the Omnitrix keep giving him? Yup, those forms.

</li><li> In the second season premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, Rattrap and Cheetor awaken to find themselves altered into Transmetals. Apart from the aesthetic differences, they also gained new movement capabilities (Cheetor gains jets and Rattrap can convert into a wheeled mode). But their first attempts at this caused them to crash around the <em>Axalon</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rattrap:</strong> This... is gonna take some getting used to.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em>, the Maximals initially have no idea how to transform into their more combat-capable robot modes after the Oracle alters their bodies to make them more technorganic. The on-board computers their original bodies possessed that handled transformations for them are absent, meaning there's more to it than simply saying "Maximize". It takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieOrFly">Die or Fly</a> situation for Optimus to figure it out. He later teaches the other Maximals how.
</li><li> This is the initial premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>: Princess Star Butterfly inherits a magic wand, but she can't wield it properly so the effects are usually chaotic and disastrous. The wand's previous owners put together an instruction book over the years that she has, but it is so messy and disorganized that it is almost useless; it's almost more family history than wand-related info (and the magical being who inhabits the book is supposed to help in theory, but often is even less helpful than the book itself). As such, her parents send her to Earth so she can try to get a handle on things <em>without</em> destroying the kingdom.
</li><li> The titular character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, who has magical Gem powers, but being a human child, doesn't understand how to use them yet. At the best of times, they just don't manifest; at other points, they manifest in the <em>worst</em> possible ways, such as when his shape-shifting nearly aged him to death or turned him into a cancerous ball of living cats. In almost all cases, including his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fusion</span> abilities, discovery, access to, or full control over them is achieved completely by accident, and usually in an ultimately instinctive fashion whilst under duress or otherwise in a state of unthinking emotional excitement.
<ul><li> Though this is later shown to also be a problem for some <em>whole</em> gems, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peridot</span> initially appears, and <em>believes</em> herself to have no special powers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and therefore be entirely dependent on cybernetic "Gemtek" prosthetics to be anything other than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a>,</span> somewhat more resilient but otherwise no more inherently powerful than a human child, thanks to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being created on Homeworld during a huge resource crisis that led to substandard Gem production</span>. Until, that is, Amethyst's frustrated attempt to break her self-imposed withdrawal <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">into social media and the internet</span> by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">throwing her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket">Security Blanket</a> tablet computer into the sea</span> causes a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening">Traumatic Superpower Awakening</a> and the reveal of her rather unique <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">purely mental, non-summon based ferrokinesis</span> abilities, as she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">catches the device in mid-air by <em>sheer force of will</em></span>. Which can be seen as a parallel to Steven's own discovery of his bubble and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hard-light shield</span> powers, both of which were awakened only by a clear and immediate danger both to himself and one or more people he cares about, after a similar protracted and completely futile series of attempts to elicit said awakening deliberately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">...although Peridot's focus was more on a threat to a <em>possession</em> instead of <em>people</em>.</span>
</li><li> It's also implied that the other Gems' control over their powers isn't entirely conscious and somewhat instinctive, matching the deliberately more animalistic nature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> states they were designed to express, as they can lose control over them, to either comical, poignant, or outright dangerous extents depending on the storytelling context. This extends not only to weaker and more juvenile-acting Gems such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ruby and Sapphire</span>, who end up respectively <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">superheating and supercooling their immediate environment</span> - despite the presence of both Steven and <em>Greg</em> - when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unfused</span> and mad at each other, but even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <em>Diamonds</em></span>, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blue</span> is shown as exerting an involuntary psychic effect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(i.e. sympathetic crying)</span> on everyone within a certain radius when deeply upset.
</li><li> Furthermore, in an example that overlaps heavily with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IHaveNoMouthAndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IHaveNoMouthAndIMustScream">I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream</a>, the events in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Monster Reunion</span>, although not fully confirmed in-universe or by the creators, <em>heavily</em> imply that the main effect of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Diamonds' rebellion-destroying superweapon</span> was to cause every Gem in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the path of its beam</span> to permanently lose control of their inherent abilities. <em>Including</em>, not only shapeshifting, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">control over the shape of their physical form altogether</span>. Although this left <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their minds largely intact within the gemstone itself</span>, the <em>extremely</em> protracted and nearly incurable case of How Do I Shot Web that then applied to <em>anything</em> they tried to do, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and even their own appearance, which profoundly conflicted with their inbuilt self-image</span>, combined with their natural immortality (now arguably a massive <em>dis</em>advantage), caused them to progressively go insane <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">over the succeeding millennia</span> and thus appear <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as the Corrupted Gem Monsters that Steven and the Crystal Gems battle</span> in the earlier series of the show.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower">She-Ra: Princess of Power</a></em>, the villain Catra has a magic mask that lets her transform into a powerful panther. Since she stole it from its rightful owner, she is unaware of the mask's other abilities like teleportation and communicating with cats. In a few episodes, she discovers these abilities.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">the 2018 reboot</a>, Adora can't figure out how to turn into She-Ra at will and spends a good portion of Episode 3 trying to get her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence">Transformation Sequence</a> to fire by dancing around with the Sword and shouting her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByThePowerOfGreyskull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByThePowerOfGreyskull">catchphrase.</a> She manages to turn Horsey into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedUnicorn">Winged Unicorn</a>, who panics and trashes a refugee camp. While she eventually figures out how to transform, she is told She-Ra has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a> abilities and tries to figure out how to use them at will. Light Hope tells her it will take several years of isolated training to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a>, so she decides to skip it since she can't leave her friends unprotected.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder20');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder20" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Learning to use a gun is often very much like this. Sure, there's the obvious parts such as pointing the barrel at what you want to kill and pulling the trigger. However, mastering a gun, especially a complex modern assault rifle, is difficult. You have to learn about sighting, trigger pull technique, the fire control group, loading, dropping magazines, changing magazines, aiming, disassembly, reassembly, and cleaning.
</li><li> Originally part of the attraction of firearms was that any idiot could be taught to use one in a couple of months or less, while mastering a longbow would take far longer (traditional longbows actually demands a lifetime of training, because you NEED to have started using one regularly in your youth to develop the muscles necessary to draw it). Firearms, in their infancy, were wildly inaccurate due to being little more than tubes containing blackpowder, an ignition source, and a metal ball for which the blackpowder would propel into an enemy, so back then "mastering a gun" did boil down to "point, shoot, and hope you kill someone else" (misfires and accidental explosion of the weapon being a big problem with early firearms). Longbows were still considered deadlier than the musket because they were accurate AND could definitively kill in the hands of a skilled archer (The reason for all that necessary muscle? A high draw strength means a lot of force sent into the arrow, meaning the arrow having much more penetrative power than a metal ball tumbling through the air). With the development of rifles (meaning the bullet now spins through the air and flies much straighter and retains much more force upon impact) guns managed to reach and surpass the killing power of bows, even with all the added infrastructure and costs that necessary to manufacture such weapons. While manufacturing, maintaining, and training to use firearms now is much more expensive and difficult than ever before, it is still far cheaper and more efficient than a bow. A well-made crossbow is a middle ground between the bow and modern firearms (from about the mid-19th century since). Its mechanisms are trickier to handle than a gun, but they also provide the mechanical advantages that allow a less-husky individual to still fire an arrow with lethal effectiveness. Modern bow designs like compound bows also employ mechanical advantage to reduce the necessary effort: less straining, more aiming.
</li><li> Many martial arts are good examples. Throwing a punch? Simple, right? Wrong. Each martial art has a technique, and it takes time to learn how to punch properly. Same applies to strikes, kicks, throws, stances, et cetera.
<ul><li> To wit, one of the most common injuries in martial arts (but mostly boxing) is known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer%27s_fracture">boxer's fracture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and is caused by poor punching technique.
</li><li> One of the first lessons taught in martial arts classes is how to make a fist, as untrained novices tend to tuck their thumbs inside their fists instead of placing it outside, which means they might break their thumb upon punching someone or something.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat inverted with building a PC: the standards of interconnects (everything is designed to fit one way) and mounting (everything is designed to mount one way) make the physical building of a PC no harder than assembling that Lego castle. The hard part is troubleshooting when something goes wrong or making sure it all fits together. It is true that most incompatible parts will not fit where they shouldn't go, but that doesn't help when you end up with a computer with no RAM because the sticks you ordered won't fit.
<ul><li> The software side is where the real "fun" begins. Software has become so user-friendly that the average user might think that loading up a computer is as easy as installing an "app". However, if the computer does nothing but beep at you when you power it on, you had better know what "beep codes" are.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35hrb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note35hrb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35hrb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is less of a thing nowadays, though, since most newer BIOSes display an error message on the screen instead when something goes wrong. Unless the onboard graphics adapter is the thing that's dead, in which case you probably need a new motherboard.</span> And while modern OSes have simplified the process of installing any drivers you need, your initial capabilities are still limited to whatever the OS disk has built-in support for.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4mqcn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4mqcn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4mqcn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is, fortunately, quite a lot, (especially nowadays), at least with mainstream OSes like Windows or most Linux distributions; a lot more drivers can fit on a DVD than on a floppy disk, and every computer created since at least the turn of the millennium has support for booting from PATA-attached optical drives built into its BIOS (BIOSes on SATA-capable motherboards have built-in support for both PATA, SATA's native mode, and SATA's PATA emulation mode), meaning that the days of needing to boot from a floppy and install optical drivers from there are hopefully long past. Also, if the installation disk <em>doesn't</em> have the specific driver for one of your pieces of hardware, it can still fall back on one of its "generic" drivers, which provide basic functionality for extremely wide numbers of a certain class of component. For instance, the installation disk's generic display driver might provide you with 256-colour, 800x600 video; it doesn't even come close to the maximum capabilities of your video card and monitor (which might support 4K resolution and 32-bit colour, along with all sorts of other goodies such as 3D acceleration), but it's enough to let you get through the installation, after which you can load the driver optimised for your specific display setup.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Lucid dreaming can be like this sometimes: you know that (at least in your dream) you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>, but you can't figure out how to actually <em>do</em> anything with that. It also takes a degree of control to think of anything to do (imagination being largely tied up running the dream).
</li><li> Walking. Of all animals, humans are the most inept at moving around immediately after being born. Of course, there are many reasons for this.
<ul><li> Having a bipedal gait limits the size of the mother's hips, meaning that only a small enough (and therefore weak) baby can be born.
</li><li> A proportionally sized brain wouldn't fit on the way out, so infants sacrifice developing the neurological control of their bodies until after they are born in order to reduce their skull size.
</li><li> A bipedal gait also means that each of a baby's lower limbs has to be twice as strong as those of a quadruped of the same mass in order to lift his/her weight.
</li><li> Even after a human has walked for many years, if one takes an injury that prevents them from walking for a period of time, the person has to relearn how to walk on top of their legs needing time to regain their strength to do so.
</li></ul></li><li> Programming. You may have mastery in the basics of it, but going from one programming language to another takes time to figure out how it works. This is on top of figuring out any projects that use said language. Or even languages that you know. And if you step away from a project, even for a few weeks, you'll likely forget how it worked and have to relearn it again. Even for code you wrote yourself.
