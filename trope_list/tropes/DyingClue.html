Turner had spent his younger days in a gang called the "Ballarat Gang" and he had first met the victim when the victim was driving a stagecoach that the gang intended to rob. Turner had the opportunity to kill the victim then, but didn't. Years later, Turner encountered the victim again and the victim, without a penny to his name, threatened to tell the police what he knew about Turner if Turner didn't support him and his family. This was all well and good until the victim wanted to marry his son to Turner's daughter. Turner wasn't having it, so he killed him. Turner's name in the gang had been "Black Jack of Ballarat."</span>

He's a Lithuanian ambassador who steps into an elevator, says what sounds like "She's gone meatless now.", and gets shot to death along with his bodyguards. Monk looks into his main political rival who has an alibi, but can't make sense of the message either.

<ul><li> A variation occurs in the 1986 solve-it-yourself comic <em>Whodunnit</em>. A murdered chemist had arranged bottles of chemicals in a row on his desk before he died, and the cops couldn't figure out what they would be used for. The hero realizes that the chemical symbols on the bottles spelled out the killer's name. Justified in that this was actually a PRE-dying clue: the scientist knew he was in danger from the guy, and stalled him long enough to casually arrange the bottles.

However, other evidence indicates that the victim thought the suspect was born on March 1. Other evidence reveals that only one suspect knew the real birthdate and could have left that message.</span>
</li><li> And yet <em>another</em> Ellery Queen example, the short story <em>A Lump of Sugar</em>. Ellery and Inspector Queen spend the whole story discussing the possible meaning of the dying clue — a lump of sugar in the victim's hand — with respect to each of the suspects, until they realize <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the killer was simply the one mostly likely to have a sugar cube in his hand: the mounted police officer.</span>

The murderer uses a uniquely science-fictional murder weapon that results in a <em>three-decades long</em>, lingering death <em>of old age</em> for the victim, so she has time to write a final message over <em>two million words</em> long — but the important bit is still so cryptic only one man could see it - and it's <em>not</em> her lover.

<ul><li> Another famous Christie example appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MurderOnTheOrientExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MurderOnTheOrientExpress">Murder on the Orient Express</a>.</em> When examining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>'s room for clues, Poirot comes across a charred piece of paper that reads "—member little Daisy Armstrong." It turns out to be a vital piece of information: the victim, who was traveling under an assumed name, was responsible for the kidnap and murder of a child heiress named Daisy Armstrong, whose death prompted a massive string of tragedies for the Armstrong household. The note helps Poirot realize that he is not investigating a mere murder, but a deeply-rooted revenge plot. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It ultimately turns out to be a subversion, though, as the person who burned the note wasn't the victim, but one of the people behind the murder—he and everyone else involved deliberately taunted the criminal by sending the note, then tried to destroy it to remove all evidence of the Armstrong case and make the crime unsolvable. The charred piece was never supposed to be found in the first place.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In a short story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSaint">The Saint</a></em> the Victim writes "COP", with people suspecting that the murderer was a policeman until Simon Templar realized the victim's nationality— in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrillicAlphabet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CyrillicAlphabet">Cyrillic Alphabet</a> "COP" = "sor".

The word 'epock' was meaningless and no anagram could be found either, so the spy's intention had been a mystery for more than twenty years. As always, Henry the waiter solves it, pointing out that the letters <em>could</em> be rearranged - to form 'CKOPE', which in the Cyrillic alphabet spells the word 'score'. This, along with a newspaper opened at the sports page (the <em>scores</em>, gettit?) implied that the agent was trying to communicate the number twenty. The Widowers' guest is thunderstruck at this - in the code they used at the time, '20' meant "Government in firm control" and if they had known this, the Bay of Pigs invasion could have been called off.

<ul><li> The mystery comic series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMazeAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMazeAgency">The Maze Agency</a></em> had an example of this version using one of Jack the Ripper's famed messages.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> comic book, "The Unauthorized Biography of Lex Luthor", starts with Clark Kent being framed for murdering a hack writer who was working on a Lex Luthor bio, when the victim supposedly wrote Kent's name with his blood on the floor. A lawyer working for LexCorp got Clark cleared by proving that the angle in which the letters were written didn't match the location of the victim's arm. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Luthor had the biographer killed, and framed Kent for the murder in order for his lawyer to clear him, thinking that Kent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouOweMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouOweMe">would owe Luthor a favor</a>.</span>

Unfortunately, even apart from the fact that the protagonist was trying to reconcile with the victim, there are a few problems- the culprit used the victim's right hand to draw the message when said victim was left-handed, and since the victim died instantly of blunt force trauma, he couldn't have written the message.

<ul><li> <em>Something Wicked</em> by Alan Gratz: Duncan is found dead with his son's name, MALCOLM, written in his blood, but the hero realizes it's a frame-up because Duncan and everyone else called his son Mal.
</li><li> The culprit in the Sherlock Holmes story <em>A Study in Scarlet</em> wrote RACHE on the wall to make the police think of a revenge killing by a secret society ...or that the murderer's name was Rachel.
<ul><li> In "A Study in Pink", a loose adaptation of the story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the victim did write RACHE, but she died before she could finish writing RACHEL, the password to her phone.</span>
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStudyInEmerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStudyInEmerald">A Study in Emerald</a>", a weird crossover between Sherlock Holmes and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>, the victim again wrote "RACHE" in the wall. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out it was, indeed, actually the nickname of the killer.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathOnTheNile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathOnTheNile">Death on the Nile</a></em> has the letter J written in blood at the scene of the crime, but Poirot dismisses it since Jackie, the obvious "J" person, had an airtight alibi and couldn't have possibly committed the murder, and in any case the victim clearly died instantly and wouldn't have left any clues. Poirot deduces that it was actually left by the murderer trying to frame Jackie. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Or, as it turns out, because they had a flair for the dramatic.</span>
<ul><li> Another Agatha Christie example appears in <em>Thirteen at Dinner.</em> After a young woman is murdered, Poirot and Hastings discover a note she had written detailing some kind of prank she was apparently playing at the titular dinner; a portion of the page has been ripped off, but it doesn't seem important, as the whole message is still legible. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unfortunately, the killer deliberately tore the page in such a way that, in the portion of the letter hinting at who had put the victim up to the trick, the word "She" became "he," prompting the detectives to examine male suspects instead of focusing on the woman who was behind the whole plot.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FatherBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FatherBrown">Father Brown</a></em> mystery "The Wrong Shape", the victim is found with a sheet of paper on their body which has typwewritten on it, "I die by my own hand; yet I die murdered!" with no quotation marks. The unusual shape of the paper (the upper left corner is snipped off, as it is on all of the sheets of paper in the room) and the presence of one less corner than sheets of paper leads Father Brown to realize that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a quotation mark was removed from a line of speech. The end of the story has a confession which indicates that the victim had been writing a story involving a man killed by hypnotism and the killer borrowed that last sheet to distract the investigators, snipped off the quotation mark, and burned the rest.</span>
</li><li> A few cases in the book <em>Minute Mysteries</em> involve this, along with other books with mini-detective puzzle shorts. More often than not, they are a framing attempt made by the person writing the note, and it's left to the reader to find the reason.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudgeDee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JudgeDee">Judge Dee</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sergeant Hong</span> is murdered in broad daylight by the person he's having tea with.

<ul><li> On one episode of <em>The Cosby Mysteries</em>, a reporter murders a British actress, writes Guy's phone number on her hand (to imply she was going to call him), and forges an entry in her diary to cast suspicion on her husband. However, Guy notices two mistakes: the forged diary entry uses the American spelling of "color" instead of the British one ("colour") and his phone number was written on her left hand which was the hand she wrote with.
</li><li> In an episode <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles">Forensic Files</a></em>, a murder victim writes out the word "ROC" on a wall in her own blood, which is the name of one of her ex-boyfriends. It turns out that Roc is innocent, and the killer wrote that to hide his trails. Unfortunately, he left fingerprints on a nearby pizza box and made a phone call traced back to the scene of the crime.

At first it appears to be a dying message, as with her hand where it is among the ingredients, the first letter of each spells out "PHELPS", the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">misspelled</span> name of her lover. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The fact it's misspelled sets of a major red flag for Alfendi and Lucy that it's fake. Turns out that this was faked by the real killer who, on top of just trying to frame the boyfriend, used the dying message as a diversion for the real reason he put the victim's hand in the sandwich.</span>

<ul><li> Happens several times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> games, and they are almost always written by the killer in order to frame someone else. The most blatant example of this is in the first case of <em>Justice for All</em>, where the name supposedly written by the victim was <em>spelled wrong</em>, and it was the name of the victim's girlfriend, whose name he obviously would have known how to spell correctly. Not to mention the fact that the victim's neck was fatally broken, meaning he would've had to have written the message with a damaged spinal cord but the prosecution ignores this. Even when the message <em>is</em> written by the victim, there is always some kind of twist to it. For example, in the third case of <em>Apollo Justice</em>, the victim wrote his own ID number to let people know he was actually an undercover Interpol agent tracking a smuggler; and in the first case of <em>Dual Destinies</em>, the victim wrote a genuine message implicating the killer, but the killer found it first and altered it in order to implicate someone else.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a></em>, Yasuhiro, thinking he'd murdered the fourth victim (who actually isn't dead yet), tries to frame Toko by writing her name in blood inside a magazine.

<p></p><h2>Real Life</h2>
<ul><li> Three words: "Omar m'a tuer". To this day, the Omar Raddad case is still unsolved. It is still not proven whether it was written by the victim or forged by a killer trying (and succeeding) to frame him. DNA evidence recently added more doubt to the mix.
<ul><li> The grammatical errors in the phrase (it should read "Omar m'a tué") make it doubtful the educated victim would have written the message. Yet no-one can prove this definitively. And impending death might very well work a number on your writing skills.
</li></ul></li><li> When Scotland Yard officially closed the Whitechapel Murders case (Jack the Ripper) in 1988, a photo of Mary Jane Kelly not previously known to the general public came to light, <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Srkelly.jpg">(excessive gore warning!)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> in the background of which many people swear they can see the letter "M" scrawled on the wall in blood, or paint. Since Kelly was in no shape to do this as or after the killer exited, she would have had to do it earlier in the evening, at which time she probably would have been better off screaming. There seems little reason for the killer to write it, and at any rate, his writing would be neater. But clearly, the "M" exists only in the imaginations of some people who have stared at the photo a little too long. There also seems little reason for an "M." There was a suspect whose first name was Montague, but aside from the fact that he seems not to have become a suspect until after Kelly's murder, there's no reason to think she knew him; in other words, she couldn't have drawn his initial on the wall if she didn't know it.
