Then, when the neighbor attempts to lift up a wheelbarrow, his arms <em>snap off from their sockets.</em> While the mother and kids scream in horror, the old man simply replies "Oh, that's not good..."
</li><li> A whole campaign for Mike's Hard Lemonade revolved around these; one, for instance, had a guy impaled with rebar. It gets used as a bottle opener.
<ul><li> Another advert had two guys working at an aquarium. However, one of the guys had one of his hands bitten off by a shark, while the other guy watches. The second guy asks about the incident and the first guy responds "Talking about your bad luck" in a calm matter.

</li><li> Levi, humanity's legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">strongest</a> soldier, breaks his ankle during a mission. His response is to wince slightly and keep going.
</li><li> Erwin Smith proves just <em>why</em> he's in charge of the Survey Corps when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Titan bites into his arm and starts carrying him off</span>. He continues shouting orders without pause because he doesn't have time to react to his injuries. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He shows up a short time later with his arm completely severed from just below the bicep and saves the day</span>.

<ul><li> In one comic, Russia's heart <em>falls out of his chest</em>. While the other nations are freaked out, not only is he unconcerned, but says that this happens on a semi-frequent basis.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> Guts does this a lot, especially in the Golden Age Arc movies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">Multiple arrows pierce his arm</a>, including one which pierces his <em>hand</em>, to which he simply comments that it might make things interesting.

All of this is well before obtaining berserk armor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">which allows him to completely ignore any pain from his injuries</a>.
<ul><li> And he manages to catch Casca before she falls from a cliff with aforementioned chest wound, and pulls her up.

<ul><li> And in episode 13, Takashiro's response to getting four ice spears stabbed into his back is to wince and tell Yuki "I'm fine." (Turns out he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>).

He doesn't seem particularly bothered by it, displaying no obvious pain, and it ultimately doesn't hamper him in the fight much. His main concern is that it messes up his 'perfect butler' image. He doesn't seem to be able to fix it, though the point quickly becomes moot as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulEating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulEating">he devours Ciel's soul</a>, he will no longer have need to maintain his butler form.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Chad took a steel girder to the shoulders and a head-on collision with a motorcycle without even the slightest complaint (the cyclist was hurt more than he was) before he even developed his powers.
</li><li> Also, Ishida is surprisingly calm after losing the use of his left hand (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">cut off in the manga</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinGore">badly broken and burned</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">in the anime</a>), especially considering he needs <em>two</em> hands to operate his main weapon. He later feels well enough after being impaled to (albeit gently) snark at Ichigo.
</li><li> Orihime too. In her introductory arc she gets hit by a car (one too many times, according to her) yet she laughs it off, claiming that the driver didn't mean to hurt her on purpose.
</li><li> Then there's Kenpachi, who reacts like this after getting jabbed at by multiple blades:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kenpachi:</strong> Is that all? I'm disappointed.
</div></li><li> Similarly, in 497 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shunsui</span> gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">shot in the right eye</a> <em>point-blank</em> by a member of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Vandenreich</span>.

</li><li> In 580, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Giselle from the Vandenreich</span> gets half of her shoulder sliced off without falling off her.

These injuries include having arms sliced off and giant holes ripped through their stomach. However, many of these aren't major injuries in the first place as they heal extremely quickly.

An even more outrageous reaction we get at one point is, while his head has been ripped in half, his mouth remaining, and the stump is spewing blood in a geyser-like fashion, he /thanks/ Dokuro for saving him from the other angel trying to kill him.

Chi-Chi doesn't even scream in pain or go to the hospital. However, in the next scene, she's seen with a few bandages and her arm in her sling. Of course, she's a martial artist herself.

She's smiling when they walk in. Admittedly, this is because they finally got here to help her, but the image is quite jarring. Shirou is an actual example; for instance, in the game's <em>Unlimited Blade Works</em> route, Shirou takes a spike to his hand defending Tohsaka, and his utter lack of reaction to having a hole in his hand (instead being more concerned about <em>her</em> condition) <em>completely freaks Tohsaka out</em>. It is around this point that she realizes that Shirou is a completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause">broken</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanSyndrome">person</a>, and begins to take measures to fix this deficiency.

<ul><li> The antagonist Kumagawa is a special case, because 1) he reacts to almost everything with the same smile and inscrutable tone of voice, and 2) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> power that lets him write things out of existence...like say, "that time I got stabbed through the chest".</span> During Medaka's fight with Kumagawa, where he throws a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">three-foot-long screw</a> through her chest, and it doesn't really affect her; justified because the attack does little to no physical damage — its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">main function</a> is something else entirely.
</li><li> Averted in the final main arc. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The heroes fight a 5,000-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Fallen Hero</a>, and it's said that the damage he inflicts never heals — so when he dislocates Medaka's right shoulder during one battle, it <em>stays</em> dislocated. When things are looking desperate in the final battle, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">former enemy</a> uses her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">de-aging</a> power to make Zenkichi two days younger, which was before he got injured in the first place. Of course, after the enemy is defeated, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">No Ontological Inertia</a> kicks in and the injuries heal as normal again...which is a good thing, because pretty much the entire cast was on death's door at that point.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In episode 20 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Uryuu Minene gets her hand blown off.</span> Her reaction? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"My hand..."</span> Spoken in a whispered voice, with only a slight wince.
</li><li> Rin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mnemosyne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mnemosyne">Mnemosyne</a></em> does a preemptive snark: just before being sucked into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurbineBlender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurbineBlender">running airjet turbine</a>, she utters with hysterical calm, "This... may be too much even for me..." Makes sense, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkMist">she doesn't exactly have anything to speak with afterwards</a>. Of course, being an immortal helped her a lot, but she still felt every millimeter of her body being ripped into watery dust.

He wakes up a month later. When Trowa, the one who was caring for him during that time, tells him about his planned "Self-detonation show", Heero's only comment was, "It hurts like hell."

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">#5 Pro Hero Mirko has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">her left arm rather gruesomely mangled and torn off</a> by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElikeMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElikeMooks">a High-End Nomu</a>. She proceeds to decapitate the Nomu with her legs and then calmly notes that she'll need to stop the bleeding to keep fighting. So Mirko <em>uses her hair as a tourniquet on the remaining stump</em> and keeps on going.</span>
</li><li> In general, characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> don't seem to consider losing limbs anything other than a minor annoyance:
<ul><li> Inverted by Hidan, who is relatively immortal and is extremely whiny about the pain caused by deadly injuries. Interestingly enough, it's often not the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">pain he</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">should</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">be complaining about, such as when he complains about Kakuzu picking up his head by the hair</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">whereupon Kakuzu notes that being decapitated should have hurt more</a>.
</li><li> Taken to ridiculous levels at the start of the encounter. Hidan's only reaction to being impaled by two large swords is "Who the hell are you?"
</li><li> Deidara takes to an extreme, even knowing that he could probably get his limbs replaced by Kakuzu or use it as part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateInjuryGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateInjuryGambit">plan</a>. Gaara rips his arm off and he merely grins, Kakashi sends the other arm to an alternative dimension and he barely even acknowledges it. Nutter.
</li><li> Done in a completely badass way when the Raikage <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has his arm set on fire by Amaterasu and is forced to cut it off to keep the fire from spreading</span> which happens without him even flinching and his next line is to tell his medic to quit gawking and stop the bleeding.
</li><li> And Kisame barely reacts at all to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Killer Bee</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks">throwing a sword into his shoulder</a>, apparently just because it would have gone <em>even further in</em> if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Samehada</a> hadn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyAbsorption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyAbsorption">eaten the chakra the blade was enhanced by</a>. Likewise, his reaction shortly afterward to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Killer Bee launching an attack so strong it smash through Samehada and blew open his chest</span> was to calmly let his opponent know this surprised him before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Samehada fused with him to heal his injuries</span>. And his reaction to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting his <em>head popped off</em></span> was to compliment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raikage and Killerbee</span>'s speed.
</li><li> Shortly thereafter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tobi</span> did pretty much the same thing as the Raikage, except he didn't even stop: he just notice his arm was infected with microscopic poison insects, <em>snapped it off at the shoulder with his one other hand</em>, and then <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrievousHarmWithABody">drop-kicked it at his opponent</a></strong>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is probably because, as we later discover, he can regrow the thing.</span> When fighting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Konan the same arm gets destroyed <em>again</em></span>, and he just seems slightly annoyed.
</li><li> Shisui Uchiha was just a bit exhausted when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Danzo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">ripped out his right eye</a></span>. To top of that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shisui then ripped off his remaining eye by himself and gave it in Itachi's care, so Danzo wouldn't get it</span>. Shisui did that like it was nothing.
</li><li> Madara Uchiha endures an incredible amount of injuries without a wince of pain:<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shukaku swiss-cheeses him; the tailed beasts smack him around and drop him into corrosive slime; a sand seal suffocates him; and collaborative tail-attack smashes him. He comes out with a lost arm, many bleeding holes, and several broken bones, yet he suffers only exhaustion and shows excitement over being able to fight as a living human again.</span> His crowning under reaction is when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he fights Might Gai, with both characters at full power. Gai's final attack bends space, shatters every bone in his leg, and obliterates most of Madara's torso. Madara just laughs while regenerating the damage, relieved that Gai didn't manage to kill him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">complimenting him</a> on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a>.</span>
</li><li> It's not just with missing limbs, the Naruto characters in general seem to have an inhumanly high tolerance to getting thrown around like ragdolls. Even being pulled out of the air by the ankle and hulksmashed into the hard earth repeatedly did very little to stop Kakashi in episode 85.
<ul><li> Speaking of Kakashi, he didn't seem to mind too much when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madara plucked his left eye from his socket. In fact, while Sakura clearly worried about it Kakashi seemed wholly unconcerned and more focused on what was happening around him.</span> In real life, such injuries tend to lead to death from shock and blood loss if left untreated.
</li></ul></li><li> Naruto takes this to extremes in <em>Gaiden</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He is impaled in the stomach with Sasuke's sword by the villain, and Naruto doesn't even feel it at all and reacts with mere <em>disappointment</em>. He even tries to feign a painful reaction to get some sympathy from others, but Kurama wasn't having any of it and tells him his battle senses have been dulled enough to let something like that happen to him in the first place.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> and villains being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> always seem to shrug off things that would kill other Shonen character let alone real people.
<ul><li> Characters who lose arms like: Shanks, Jozu, Nekomamushi, Perospero or people lose legs like: Zeff, Kyros and Inuarashi have grand reactions ranging from just wincing in pain to "Oh well it's just a limb" or in Kyros case not even reacting at all and just keeping on fighting.
</li><li> Justified with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlobMonster">Logia Users</a> who thanks to their intangible nature tend to just smile and chuckle at getting their heads cut off or being bisected at the torso.
</li><li> Among the Straw hats The Monster Trio are the most guilty of this.
<ul><li> Luffy at one point punches Don Krieg in the face when he was covering himself a spiked cape, the result was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">Nausea Fuel</a> for everyone <em>except Luffy</em> who didn't even look pained. Later on, Luffy gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerPokeOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerPokeOfDoom">Finger Poke of Doom</a> to the throat from Rob Lucci and just violently coughs, Lucci states if Luffy wasn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Rubber Man</a> he'd be dead from that. Though that's nothing compared Luffy's fight with Magellan where he doesn't even cry out in pain at getting his arms melted.
</li><li> Zoro does this a lot, the most notably when Mihawk's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> autographed his torso and he spends the next arc running around and fighting with a wound that even Arlong the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the arc finds horrifying. There's also the time he cut halfway through his shins to escape a trap and could still walk afterward. Most remember the time he took all Luffy's pain and claimed while bloodied that's "It's nothing", averted though as two of Zoro's crewmates heard him screaming in agony before then.
</li><li> Sanji has remarkable tolerance for pain, at one point after beating his opponent he casually comments that he broke several ribs, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> a jagged edge of rib cage can puncture major blood vessels or internal organs but Sanji kept fighting as normal. Hell, one arc earlier, Sanji was running around after getting his spine cracked and post <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> he just clenches his teeth at getting his <em>tibia</em> cracked. Not to mention the time Sanji's response to getting scorched <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">by a massive lightning beam</a>, was to thank the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise">God</a> who did it for lighting up his cigarette.
</li></ul></li><li> Interesting example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> Nami as she gets impaled straight through the foot and it clearly hurts but she determinedly shrugs it off saying that compared what her friend Vivi is going through it's nothing.
</li><li> Usopp does this occasionally, in his first arc he gets shot in the arm and just keeps running, in a later arc he gets skull smashed by a <em>4-ton bat</em> to the face and he still stands up again and has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a>.
</li><li> Franky after becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Cyborg</a> has many moments of this, like just crying in pain at getting shot in the back or when his face gets blasted off and he isn't even winded and the people around him are more concerned.
</li><li> During the climax of the Dressrosa arc, Doflamingo gets his internal organs sliced apart by Law and instead of dying he just stitches them back together with his Devil Fruit power and doesn't slow in the slightest
</li><li> Whitebeard is the undisputed winner, <em>as he gets half his goddamn face blown off</em> and his reaction is simply irritation and he has no problem having a big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">Final Speech</a> while lacking most of his head.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessMononoke">Princess Mononoke</a></em>, Ashitaka gets shot through the chest and treats it like a minor inconvenience. While he does eventually pass out, he manages to not only make it out of Irontown first, he does so by lifting a gate made of thick logs one-handed while carrying an unconscious San with his other arm. It's unclear how much of this was the demonic essence afflicting him and how much was just sheer refusal to stop going.
</li><li> Zack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePromisedNeverland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePromisedNeverland">The Promised Neverland</a></em> is the most active member of the Goldy Pond kids, and as such, he's gotten quite used to horrible injury to the point where breaking his wrist is a minor annoyance. Played with in that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a>, primarily because of being used to treating his many, many wounds.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Corporal Oland</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PumpkinScissors">Pumpkin Scissors</a></em> doesn't feel pain when under the influence of the Blue Lantern, and is so used to coming out of it with horrific injuries that he barely even notices them anymore. For example, during the ballroom arc he gets hit in the head and shoulder with a sledgehammer, hit in the face and stomach with a mace, run over by horses, and thrown through a window. He barely even acknowledges most of these.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> was Kuno would suffer massive damage and only respond with a deadpan "That hurt, you know."
<ul><li> Once while in Dr.Tofu's clinic Ranma gets his neck bent when Kasumi came in which unintentionally distracts him. Pointing out his mistake only got his neck bent the other way. He jogs out of the clinic with his head still bent looking for Akane, even asking for her to Nabiki. His neck gets fixed by Akane when she slams his head on the ground when he annoys her (trying to cheer her up). But at the end of the chapter, he once again gets his neck sprained by Akane after he <em>again</em> angers her enough to get beaten up by her.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins">The Seven Deadly Sins</a></em>, if Meliodas or Ban react to a wound in the appropriately pained way, that means shit's getting real. Regardless of how long it takes for them to register.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, Chrona does this at times. Chrona's reaction to a surprise scythe to the gut is, "Where did <em>that</em> come from?"
</li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SpaceAdventureCobra">Space Adventure Cobra</a></em>, Cobra gets impaled on his chest by a sword. He nervously acknowledges his luck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAFleshWound">that it isn't fatal</a>, but not before turning to his enemy like nothing happened to mock and immediately kill him. The other two times he's seen being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">Impaled with Extreme Prejudice</a>, however, do knock him out a little more.
</li><li> Thanks to their <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelNoPain">super pain-nullifying pills</a></span>, the baddies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordOfTheStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordOfTheStranger">Sword of the Stranger</a></em> do this several times, often getting shot by multiple arrows and just continuing to fight or casually chat about something else. In one scene, a man's arm gets lopped off; he hardly notices, and seems more upset that he didn't get to finish firing his gun.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Knives</span> had an odd reaction when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vash</span> shoots him for the first time: instead of writhing in pain, he became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">totally distraught</a> that his own brother would raise a gun against him.
<ul><li> Of course said brother had been very serious about being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a> for most of his (very long) life, so it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">legitimately shocking</a> if not for the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">Knives</a> had been trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">drive Vash to kill</a> for about the same time</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, the Pharaoh is knocked from a high cliff by Bakura. He wakes in a cave with a bloodied head and wounds and promptly decides the best thing to do is follow Bakura to his base, to prevent him from attacking the city again. Several other characters display this reaction throughout the series when at their most altruistic - Joey in particular takes a lot of damage throughout the series, in one instance being pummeled by yo-yos from all directions before going off to fight an old gang friend of his.

Without it, the fight would've gone on longer and everyone would've probably gotten badly injured.

<ul><li> Although some productions cut this out (it is, strictly speaking, unnecessary for the plot), Mercutio actually gives a fairly long speech about his wound. While at face value the words imply that it's not so bad, he's actually talking about how he's about to die through Double Entendres. One of which is also a sexual innuendo. Presumably, this is intended to invoke [[Squick]] for audience and characters alike.

</li><li> Because of the way the game assigns vocal responses, players can die with varying levels of noisiness...but it's hard not to chuckle a little at the Demoman's quiet, hissed "Oh, that smarts!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">even as he's being blown into a dozen bloody pieces by a rocket.</a> Given that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a> though, this is more comical than morbid.
</li><li> The Soldier could be considered a variation on the trope; since he says pretty much <em>everything</em> in the same deranged bellow, it's hard to tell when he's shouting because he's been hit and when he's shouting because that's just the noise he makes when things happen.
</li><li> Near the end of the "Meet the Medic" video, the Scout steps out after having undergone extensive heart surgery (including, as it is revealed, accidentally having a live pigeon inserted) and cheerfully announces to his allies, "You would not <em>believe</em>... how much this hurts."
</li><li> With the addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">Pyrovision</a>, any time a player is hurt (or even killed) all voice responses are replaced with laughter.

Miss Pauling's response is just as nonchalant. Soldier even thanks the (very perturbed) veterinarian for sowing back his and back <em>with the hand that was cut off</em>.

</div></li><li> Similarly, in <em>Old Wounds</em>, Zhanna's response to having to cut off her own hand to escape is to comment that her thumb doesn't hurt anymore, which makes Soldier proud. Later on, when Heavy - her brother - sees her hand is missing, he simply nods at her explanation... and then notices she's wearing a necklace made of ears, which is the Soldier equivalent of an engagement ring, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">and then Heavy starts freaking out.</a>

Granted, he's on a team with Garrus Vakarian (who survived taking a fighter jet's missile to the face) and Commander Shepard (who, by the time of conversation, has just bounced back from <em>being dead for two years</em>), so maybe a mere bullet doesn't <em>deserve</em> that much of a reaction.

<ul><li> Richard nonchalantly mentions that he broke 5 ribs in "The Prank" when he pretended to be crazy and ran through several walls.
</li><li> In "The Picnic", Gumball and Darwin are completely calm about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">their eyes being on fire</a>, even when Darwin says "there are no words to describe the pain I feel right now".
</li><li> In "The Bet", Bobert blows up the nurse's office with the nurse still in it, and the nurse just puts a bandage on her charred body (which is <em>also</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateInanimateObject">a bandage</a>) before passing out.
</li><li> Gumball casually states "now you have to take me to the infirmary" after a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalLimbRotationRange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalLimbRotationRange">bizarre rotations of portions of his body</a> cause his heart to end up in his stomach and his lungs to end up in his arms.

Gumball accidentally knocks Sussie's eye out in an attempt to find something to apologize to her for. She screams "Aaah! Aaah! Aaah! But Sussie like this, too!"
</li><li> One of the cutouts in "The Extras" snaps himself in half trying to reach down to get popcorn. He's just happy he got the popcorn.
</li><li> The red construction worker in "The Butterfly" is just mildly annoyed that his head got knocked off, and the construction workers in general (all LEGO men) don't seem to care about losing limbs either, just putting themselves back together offscreen.
</li><li> Darwin throws a lady through a window in "The Safety". She doesn't mind.
</li><li> In "The Nobody", a pot falls off a shelf and is smashed on Gumball's head and he falls back on a chair when he tries to find a hidden room. He doesn't even flinch.

Fortunately, Tails misses the bomb... only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet">hit Sonic in the foot instead</a>. Sonic doesn't even sound remotely in pain, but he is a bit snarky about it.

<ul><li> In "Tears of a Clooney", Francine doesn't seem bothered when her hand gets full of glass after she punches a window.
</li><li> In "Stanny Boy and Frantastic", Stan gets a compound fracture in his leg after falling down a stairwell, leaving his bone visibly sticking out. He's fairly chill about it but mentions that he's about to go into shock.
</li><li> In "Holy Shit, Jeff's Back!", when Hayley goes through the Blorpher and it shreds her like a woodchipper on one end to rebuild her on the other, she pulls Roger through it along with her. Roger flatly states that it's a very, very deep pain.
</li><li> In "Next of Pin", when Stan admits that he stabbed Steve in his leg to end his bowling career, he stabs himself 10 times to show that it's not that painful. He doesn't flinch during any of them, but he quickly passes out.
</li><li> In "She Swill Survive", a CIA agent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOrLimbDecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeOrLimbDecision">whose leg gets stuck to the ground with maple syrup</a> nonchalantly shoots said leg off and hops away.
</li><li> "The Bitchin' Race" has Stan getting stabbed in the chest by a yak's horn. He isn't terribly phased by it and <em>pushes the yak's horn further into his chest and out his back</em>.
</li><li> Similar to the first example, in "I Am the Jeans: The Gina Lavetti Story", Francine explodes a wine glass in her hand in frustration, then rubs the resulting blood in her hair.
</li><li> In "Exquisite Corpses", Roger isn't bothered by having a knife thrown into his stomach.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissionHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MissionHill">Mission Hill</a></em> had Gus go home one episode with a butcher knife stuck in his head after someone tried to mug him. Not only did he not care about the knife, but he was annoyed at Wally for trying to remove it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>. In the episode "Steven the Sword Fighter", Pearl begins to show Steven basic sword techniques by sparring with a holographic version of herself. Steven is not impressed and repeatedly asks her to show some moves from a show he likes. Pearl begins to explain that those aren't REAL sword techniques, but gets so distracted during this, her holographic self straight up IMPALES her with the sword! Pearl looks down, then begins to reassure Steven that she'll be okay, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBodyLeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBodyLeftBehind">EXPLODING</a>, leaving only her gemstone behind. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">She IS completely fine in the end</a>, but it's a very jarring moment.

For example, in one episode, Stumpy accidentally causes a bunch of arrows to shoot Kaeloo, Quack Quack, and Pretty. Rather than scream in pain, they just glare at him, annoyed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em>: In the episode "The Trail to Udugu", while taking charge of the Lion Guard for the day, Simba gets his tail crushed by a large boulder. Cats' tails are usually sensitive, but Simba casually treats it with mild annoyance, saying that he's fine other than his tail being crushed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em>, Sarah Lynn stabs herself with a rusty bayonet in the middle of a hardware store, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">mostly to call attention to herself and her breakup with Andrew Garfield</a>. She doesn't have much of a reaction to the pain. Although BoJack drives her to a hospital, she apparently didn't get official help, as she shows up at BoJack's house with <em>duct tape</em> where the <em>rusty bayonet</em> had gone through. She proceeds to proclaim herself "Good as new." <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31a6m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31a6m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31a6m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Duct tape <em>can</em>, in fact, be used as an <em>emergency</em> first aid adhesive for bleeding wounds, but requires prompt, professional medical care and proper dressing as soon as possible after application.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> codifies many stock treatments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a> in cartoons, including underreactions. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RabbitFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RabbitFire">Rabbit Fire</a>", for example, Daffy gets repeatedly shot in the face and only responds with a disgusted "you're despicable."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse">The Owl House</a></em>: In "A Lying Witch and a Warden", Eda barely acknowledges her hand coming off as a nuisance.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, Brock's first interaction with Colonel Gathers has him getting stabbed in the hand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">for saluting at him</a>. He barely reacts to it, and while this would be a fairly tame example on its own, what makes it notable is that he actually reacts <em>more</em> to Gathers hitting him in the knee with a rod, which is a more minor injury in comparison.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder23');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder23" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There's a bit of science behind this in real life. When seriously injured, your body releases endorphins, in order to keep the pain under somewhat manageable control (conveniently enough, this lasts just long enough for medical aid to arrive).
</li><li> In the Battle of Gettysburg during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, Union General Dan Sickles' leg was shattered by a 12-pound cannonball. In order to inspire his men to keep fighting, Sickles showed virtually no sign of pain in reaction to this. He relinquished command to General David Birney, and then calmly smoked a cigar as he was loaded onto a stretcher and carried away from the field.
</li><li> Leprosy degenerates the nerves in the extremities of the body i.e. fingers, hands, toes, feet. Skin sores, high infection, and no pain is just a recipe for unintentional gangrene; which is the actual cause of lost limbs. This was exploited by the Order of Saint Lazarus, which was originally an order of knights infected with leprosy. They had a reputation for being extremely hard to kill since they did not feel most of their wounds.
</li><li> A Reader's Digest story was submitted wherein a teacher at a school warned the kids about how high they were climbing in a tree. Sure enough, not long after she walked away, one of the kids fell a good six meters out of a tree (around twenty feet), landed on his back, and <em>ran over</em> screaming because of a cut under his fingernail. When she pointed out that he was bleeding all over his leg, he just said "Oh. That too."
</li><li> An anecdotal occurrence came from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a> — specifically near the end of the Battle of Waterloo, with the British command staff observing the French attacks from a hilltop. Cannons fire, and:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lord Uxbridge:</strong> By God, Sir! I've lost my leg! <br/><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington">The Duke of Wellington</a>:</strong> By God, sir, so you have!
</div><ul><li> Uxbridge was then taken to his headquarters away from the battle and had the remaining stump of the leg amputated with no painkillers of any sort, as anything other than a leather strap to bite had not yet been invented. What's more, according to his aide, Col. Thomas Wildman, he remained composed enough to smile through the operation.
<div class="indent"><strong>Uxbridge:</strong> <em>[while getting his stump amputated]</em> The knife appears somewhat blunt.
</div></li><li> A similar bit of battlefield black humor occurred during or after the Battle of Trafalgar. A British sailor's injury was so grave as to require the amputation of his leg. Said sailor's reaction was: "Never! Where shall I find another match for this one?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoratioNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoratioNelson">Horatio Nelson</a> did this several times. When he was blinded in one eye at Calvi by debris struck by a gunshot, he wrote to Lord Hood, "I got a little hurt this morning; not much, as your lordship may judge by my writing." When he was fatally shot in the back at Trafalgar, he said: "Why, my dear Hardy, I do believe they've done it at last. My backbone is shot through. Take care of Lady Hamilton for me."
</li><li> On the French side, the Memoirs of Baron Larrey, chief surgeon of the Imperial Guard, give many examples of soldiers who had wounds requiring immediate amputation... and shrugged them off, asking Larrey to please amputate their neighbours first.
</li></ul></li><li> In real life, while campaigning for re-election, US President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was shot in the chest and the bullet went through his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PocketProtector">steel glasses case and the folded speech he was about to give</a> before it hit him, but by that point, it had been slowed enough to not be a life-threatening wound. Declining suggestions that a hospital visit might be in order, Roosevelt instead proceeded to give a 90-minute speech, opening with the lines:
<div class="indent"><strong>Roosevelt:</strong> Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4zrag');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4zrag" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4zrag');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Bull Moose was the mascot of his political party and is an animal with an apparently tough hide. Of course, being an avid outdoorsman, he'd likely know exactly how hard it is to kill a Bull Moose.</span>
</div><ul><li> Roosevelt became president after the assassination of William McKinley, who died not from the gunshots themselves but 8 days later from gangrene after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery">surgery in early 20th century conditions</a>. Avoiding the operating room when he knew it wasn't necessarily life-threatening was probably very high on Roosevelt's priority list.
</li><li> His cousin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranklinDRoosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> simply said "I have a terrific pain in the back of my head." before dying from a cerebral hemorrhage.

While walking away from the wreckage, he noticed his legs didn't seem to be working properly. It turned out both lower leg sections had been crushed. Had they been his original legs, he would likely have bled to death before he could have been freed.

</li><li> During his <em>No Cure for Cancer</em> special, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DenisLeary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DenisLeary">Denis Leary</a> relates how his father, an Irish immigrant, reacted to injury, like, during a visit home, Denis saw his father shoot a nail through his hand with a nailgun, and, without missing a beat, <em>pulled it out with his teeth</em>. Then there was his reaction to nearly cutting off his thumb with a circular saw. Mainly, patching it up with electrical tape and driving himself to the hospital because his sense of masculinity wouldn't let him let himself be driven there by a woman. Denis then says the following:
<div class="indent">I turned to my brother and said "Hey pal, forget about crying, okay? Crying is over. We're never gonna be able to cry about anything ever, okay?

</li><li> Actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NatashaRichardson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NatashaRichardson">Natasha Richardson</a> hit a tree while skiing and whacked her head. She felt OK and sent the medics away. An hour or so later help was summoned again due to increased pressure from the bleeding in her brain, but by then it was too late and she died in the hospital. This is actually the classic presentation of an epidural hematoma, which Ms. Richardson died from, and one of many reasons why they are almost always fatal — the person genuinely feels okay initially and only as time goes on do the symptoms worsen, by which point it's too late to save the person.
</li><li> Empress Elisabeth of Austria was stabbed in the heart by an assassin. She fell over but was able to get back up and stated that she felt no pain, believing that he had simply missed (in reality, the 4-inch blade had gone all the way in). Later when she removed her clothes she promptly died from her wound, her corset being the only thing keeping her from bleeding out.
</li><li> While not nearly as serious as some others on the list, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanBean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanBean">Sean Bean</a> was assaulted and stabbed with a broken glass bottle in a bar fight. His response? He refused medical attention, patched himself up with the bar's first aid kit, and ordered another drink.
</li><li> Subverted in one StoryCorps interview — the interviewee's father had a <em>wooden leg</em> which broke one day while he was working on a farm. The man cried, "Oh darn, I think I broke my foot!" and then just snapped it back in place and kept working. The person who was helping him didn't know the leg was a prosthetic, and turned white as a sheet and later called the man "the toughest man I've ever seen."
</li><li> New Zealand rugby player Wayne Shelford had his scrotum torn open during a ruck, leaving his testicle dangling. He simply told the medic to sew it back up and continued the game until he was knocked out later by a blow to the head.
</li><li> A man named William Striler pulled a revolver from his coat outside a courthouse and fired six shots at 53-year-old attorney Gerry Curry.

</li><li> Tablesaw blades are so fast and so sharp that by the time you cut your entire hand off with one the sensation hasn't even reached your brain.
</li><li> In Virginia, a gymnast misjudged a distance and rammed her foot into a metal strip so hard three toes stopped moving. She looked at it, debated on whether she could keep going, and went so far as to ask her friends what they thought. When told to go home, she sat down, waited to see if her toes would start working again and was forced to go home by the instructor. She didn't even limp as she left. The toes never worked quite right ever again.
</li><li> A possibly extreme example was the drummer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/XJapan">X Japan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoshikiHayashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YoshikiHayashi">Yoshiki Hayashi</a>, who, during a 1995 show, suddenly stopped playing drums, reached up to rub his neck and shoulder, tried again but looked confused in a second when he couldn't move or hit the kicks, then collapsed. It seemed like his usual dramatic stage collapses for show until the show was stopped and he was removed from the stage and taken away in an ambulance. It was later determined that he'd broken his neck, sustaining the split cervical spine discs that never would heal properly and required surgery years later - and most likely only avoiding death or quadriplegia out of sheer luck as to which split.

</li><li> Any injury or condition that damages the nerves badly enough, such as leprosy mentioned above or third-degree burns, will result in this.
</li><li> Crossing over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>, there is a condition called congenital insensitivity to pain, wherein the person feels no pain when they hurt themselves. The problem is that people with this condition (particularly kids) never learn to protect themselves, so they will unthinkingly burn themselves by sticking their hands in hot water or will not notice that they're bleeding from irritation from too-tight headbands. A good profile on the condition can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/18/magazine/ashlyn-blocker-feels-no-pain.html">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Some years ago, an elderly docent at the International Printing Museum was struggling with a malfunctioning Linotype machine during a special event. His frustration overcame his common sense, and he put his hand in harm's way, in one of the few places where one can get seriously injured on a Linotype. A fingertip was partially severed, but he calmly shut down the machine, before being hauled off to the emergency room.
</li><li> On August 6, 1915, after several failed attempts to capture the Russian Osowiec Fortress, the German army resorted to pumping it full of Chlorine Gas. The Russian troops in the fort did not have a sufficient number of gas masks, forcing them to resort to covering their faces with water or urine soaked rags and undershirts in a desperate attempt to get some sort of protection from the deadly fumes. The German army then sent 12 battalions of troops equipped with gas masks in to capture the fort. Walking past mountains of Russian corpses in the outer ring of Osowiec, the German soldiers casually approached the fort, expecting no further resistance, only to be shocked to see the surviving members of the Osowiec garrison come out to attack them. With faces covered by blood soaked rags and undershirts, and many troops literally coughing pieces of their own lungs, the Russian troops somehow managed to re-man their machine guns and artillery pieces, while the remaining soldiers launched a bayonet charge, sending the German army fleeing in panic. The retreat was so disorganized that many of the men were trampled into the ground by their fellow troops or entangled in their own barb-wire emplacements as they fled back to their trench lines. This event would become known as "The Attack of the Dead men" since the Russian troops who launched the attack were so badly injured from the poison gas that they looked like walking corpses and a large portion of them ended up dying later.
