Later studies of Neanderthals, and other species of humans who lived during then, indicated they were likely just as smart as <em>Homo sapiens</em>, if not more so, and seem to have been about as peaceful and empathetic.

However, as the series' Ainu language supervisor, Nakagawa Hiroshi, states in the seventh chapter of <em>Ainu Bunka de Yomitoku Golden Kamuy</em> ("Reading and Understanding Ainu Culture: Golden Kamuy"), Mokottunasi Kitahara discovered not only that there was an Ainu story about a girl raised as a skilled huntress in her murdered older brothers' place but also that <em>Kinsei Ezo Jinbutsushi</em> ("Personages of Early Modern Ezo") by Takeshiro Matsuhara documented a real-life Ainu huntress named Ciyuhirika.

</li><li> French stand-up comedian Coluche did a skit on TV in 1979 in which he joked, "Just wait 'til the left [wins the presidential elections] in 2012!" At the time, a French president's term was 7 years, until Jacques Chirac changed it to 5 in 2000 after a referendum, 14 years after Coluche's death. Not only did the presidential election happen in 2012 (and not 2014, like it would have had Chirac not changed it), but the left did win.

The idea was to make it sound impressive and something so expensive, only Tony himself could afford to produce and use it. In 2016, titanium-gold alloy was produced for real—and was discovered to be 4 times stronger than titanium alone (which isn't that impressive, as titanium's main use is its light weight, not its strength).

In the commentary for that strip, Stephan Pastis admitted that he only used chateaubriand because it sounded fancy without knowing what it was, but he hoped it really was a type of food. It is — it's a type of steak, which can be cooked medium well. Guard Duck also orders "a glass of your finest pinot noir", which is in no way a bad wine pairing.

</li><li> In Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a>,</em> Prince Philip is trying to get his moody horse Samson to follow his orders, so he bribes him with "an extra bucket of oats" as well as carrots. Oats and other grains are supplemental feed used for an energy-boost, and most horses only need a few pounds per day if at all. Since Philip promised an EXTRA bucket of oats (assuming it holds 1-2 gallons for your average hand-carried "bucket"), this means Samson gets ten or twenty pounds of grain along with his regular oats, which horses do eat...after insane exertion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRace">Epic Race</a> levels. This would mean: 1) racehorses who sprint for several miles, 2) war-horses after a battle, or 3) endurance horses who can truck along for a whole DAY of eight to ten hours. Given that they DO end up fighting Maleficent at the climax, twenty pounds of oats would <em>certainly</em> be a good idea, but as it was used for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>, it's not clear if the writers actually knew horses need that much grain after hard work.

Of course it's still not the most practical way to link arcade machines that are literally right next to each other; any meaningful data link between arcade machines would far more likely take place over network cabling.

Only two years prior to the movie's release, however, paleontologists discovered <em>Utahraptor</em>, which really <em>was</em> about the size of the raptors in the movie. And at the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark">the book</a> was written, Gregory Paul had proposed reclassifying <em>Deinonychus</em> as <em>Velociraptor antirrhopus</em>, believing the species to be similar enough to <em>Velociraptor mongoliensis</em> to justify it being a different species in the same genus, rather than in its own genus. Crichton chose to follow Paul's nomenclature, rather than the standard. Thus, the <em>Velociraptors</em> in the movie and books are actually <em>Deinonychus</em> because Paul's theory wasn't disproven until after publishing. This is why Alan Grant is digging up a supposed <em>Velociraptor</em> in America, where the actual <em>Velociraptor</em> didn't live, but <em>Deinonychus</em> did. In the years since then, another dromaeosaur has been found matching <em>Jurassic Park</em>'s raptors for size, <em>and</em> it lived in roughly the same time and place as the raptor Grant was digging up. It's called <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakotaraptor">Dakotaraptor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.

Later in 2006, <em>Spinosaurus</em> turned out to be not only larger than a <em>T. rex</em> but also the largest carnivorous dinosaur of them all. A later evidence indicates that <em>Spinosaurus</em> was also aquatic, making the climactic scene where it rises out of the water while swimming also somewhat accurate. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Of course, it's now thought that it was short-legged instead of long-legged like in the movie so it kind of cancels itself out</a>.

The characters state that no such remains have ever been found that far back in time before. At the time, the oldest known hominids were three million years-old members of the genus <em>Australopithecus</em>, but in 1994, a newly discovered five million years-old hominid, <em>Ardipithecus</em>, was announced.

But there was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.luft46.com/lippisch/lip04106.html">another, much more obscure Nazi flying wing design<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the filmmakers were presumably unaware of— and it looked almost exactly like the one in the movie.

He describes it as similar to the language of the Nias islanders. Nias is a real place in Indonesia, but the language of the film is completely fabricated. Nonetheless, Englehorn's ability to translate is not all that implausible. Many of the languages of the Pacific share common enough roots to be mutually intelligible to fluent speakers.

Such a title would, in fact, have precedent in Mozart's oeuvre, which contains a vocal canon named "Leck Mich im Arsch" (in German literally "lick me in the arse", or "kiss my ass"). Also, many heavy metal musicians are classically trained, which may surprise people who think the genre is all about noise and Satanism.

Evidently they did an excellent job.

Tyrell says they already tried "Ethyl methanesulfonate" unsuccessfully. Ethyl methanesulfonate <em>is</em> an actual organic compound with mutagenic qualities, used in genetics. The scriptwriter later admitted he did no research for the conversation and the mention of a real compound in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a> was coincidental.

However, a blink-and-you-miss-it moment near the beginning of the movie shows Scott Peterson as the name of an inmate incarcerated in the same cryogenic prison as antagonist Simon Phoenix. The movie was released in 1993. Scott Peterson was convicted of murdering his wife in a highly-publicized trial in 2005. The judge in the case sentenced him to death, so putting him on ice is metaphorical in this instance.

At the time the Star Wars movies were written, binary star systems were thought of as too unstable to actually contain planets. In the early 1990s, astronomers theorized (and later confirmed) the existence of a planet in the binary star system PSR B1620-26, and today, it's known to be fairly common (e.g. Kepler-16b).

Interestingly enough, the Cubs did make the playoffs in 2015, but rather than win the World Series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">they ended up getting knocked out of the playoffs in the NLCS, coincidentally losing that series on October 21.</a>

That said, some of the gadgets we see are pretty close to ones that actually existed in the real 2015, such as video calls and being able to watch six channels at once (although you do both on the computer, rather than a TV), and machines that respond to voice commands.

In actual fact, the titular character in Jane Eyre has this quite memorable line to Mr. Rochester: "Do you think I am an automaton?  a machine without feelings?

<ul><li> In the episode "200", when Martin is giving another one of his derivative movie pitches (this time a thinly-veiled Star Trek parody), his version of Carter delivers the line "the singularity is about to explode". In the following scene when the team is criticizing the scene, the real Carter specifically mocks that line for being ridiculous. However, in real life, singularities gradually lose mass via Hawking radiation, and if the mass of a singularity becomes low enough, it will rapidly evaporate and release a tremendous amount of energy in a short period of time as it dies, much like a nuclear explosion or matter-antimatter annihilation.

While it seems to be mostly a knock on Broadway largesse and the original's notorious overambition, a lot of comic fans remarked that, while the writers probably didn't realize it, it's actually a very apt parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a></em>, an infamous <em>Spider-Man</em> arc that was also severely overlong and featured multiple Spider-Men.

<ul><li> One theory about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FermatsLastTheorem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FermatsLastTheorem">Fermat's Last Theorem</a> is that Fermat's proof was actually wrong, but the results were correct anyway. In fact, this is almost universally believed within the mathematical community. Fermat always <em>did</em> turn out to have a proof when he said he did, so it's likely that he at least <em>thought</em> he could prove this. Fermat essentially created several areas of math despite not publishing much of his work, including a general form of integration along with finding a general way to get rates of change, making it possible that far from being mistaken, he did discover a proof for a special case and generalized it incorrectly (the book that he wrote it in was actually the first attempt ever to use a symbolic system to write algebra). Given the insane complexity of Andrew Wiles's proof, very few mathematicians believe that 17th-century mathematics could have produced any solution at all, much less a simple one. Both of the theorems Wiles used to make his proof were twentieth-century in origin. Also, the theorem holds the record for the most <em>wrong</em> proofs.
<ul><li> It's fairly easy to prove for the special case of n=3 and n=4 or other small numbers. The hard part comes from proving it for *all* n. Most likely, Fermat proved the former and mistakenly thought he had proved the latter.

Michael Stevens of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vsauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vsauce">Vsauce</a></em> points out that one could interpret the song as being <em>dramatically</em> ironic, when the significance of something is unknown to a character but known to others. The individual events aren't examples of situational irony, but life is ironic because life knows what we need while what we think we need differs. It's also been suggested that the song "Ironic" not having any examples of irony is itself ironic and appropriate. This is also a meta-example of irony, as there is one instance in the song that is often overlooked - a man overcoming his fear of flying to end up involved in a plane crash - which ironically makes the accusations of being entirely unironic inaccurate.

An investigation at the time could only conclude that it was a bizarre and astonishing coincidence. Only in the 1980s did the answer come out — the crossword-puzzle editor was a teacher, and he used his students to collect odd words. One of those students had hung around military camps and bases enough to overhear the unusual words being spoken, and promptly turned them over.

This first spacewalk lasted for twelve minutes.

<ul><li> The Greek philosopher Leucippus created the atomic theory, as an argument against another philosopher, Parmenides. While Parmenidies argued against the idea that a state of nothingness could exist, Leucippus argued that there were in fact voids and that everything that was not a void was made of small units of matter that assembled to create larger ones. Aristotle scoffed at the argument, stating that in a complete absence of matter, motion would no longer encounter friction and allow for infinite speeds, which he saw as ridiculous. Well, turns out that what Aristotle used to try to discredit the theory is pretty close to what actually occurs to objects in motion in space. Of course, his view of atoms was also confirmed, though there are more particles than he thought.
</li><li> Finnish naturalist Immanuel Ilmoni hypothesized in the early 18th century that diseases were actually living beings, not unlike animals. While he was ridiculed, the germ theory of diseases was confirmed less than a hundred years later.
</li><li> The rules for heat movement were created based on the idea that heat was a fluid/gas called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caloric_theory">caloric.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> One of the reasons that this theory stuck around so long is that the rules concerning the movement of heat are the exact same as the movement of diffuse material in a fluid. Thus, while caloric was abandoned as a theory, the rules of heat movement were unchanged.
</li><li> This apparently happened twice due to correspondence between Galileo and Kepler. Scientists at the time would sometimes write down discoveries with scrambled letters when they weren't ready to publish their findings, but wanted to establish priority of discovery. Galileo wrote two such letters to Kepler, one concerning his discovery of Saturn's rings, the other concerning the phases of Venus. Kepler tried to unscramble them both and ended up with different sentences, one claiming that Mars had two moons and the other that there was a moving red spot on Jupiter. By complete coincidence, both of those claims were correct, but neither would be proven for centuries.
</li><li> In 1900, the Russian archaeologist Friedrich Zibold discovered the remains of a mysterious domed structure in the Byzantine Crimean site of Theodosia. After studying the ruins and some terracotta pipes found nearby, he proposed that the structure was an air well designed to condense moisture from the air into water, and built a replica to test it. This replica was successful and became the precursor of modern air wells. However, it was discovered later that the ancient structure was actually a tomb, the pipes were not related to it, Zibold had used the wrong materials for his replica, and weather conditions at the time (which had included thick fog) had exaggerated the results of the experiment. But by sheer coincidence, these materials were the right type to make a working air well — had Zibold used the real ones in the tomb, his experiment would have been a failure — and had weather conditions been more characteristic of the area (not as much fog), it wouldn't have worked as well as Zibold reported it did. Neither of these problems were discovered until 90 years after Zibold's experiment. In other words, Zibold inadvertently invented a new technology as a result of an attempt to replicate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> that didn't actually exist in the first place.

<ul><li> The play <em>Abigail's Party</em> makes a humorous reference to putting red wine (Beaujolais) in the fridge, as a comment of misguided middle class aspirations in the 70s. However, playwright Mike Leigh later learned that Beaujolais is one of a few red wines that is best when chilled.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMikado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMikado">The Mikado</a></em>, W.S. Gilbert used the name Ko Ko because he thought it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords">funny-sounding,</a> and didn't know at the time that it is a legitimate Japanese name. Just ask <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoldenTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoldenTime">Kouko Kaga.</a>
</li><li> One of the biggest points of academic contention about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> is whether or not the eponymous Prince of Denmark is <em>actually</em> mad, or just faking it. The Vikings did allegedly have some sort of taboo against killing a person afflicted with madness, which makes pretending to be one a viable survival trait for the son of a usurped Danish king. Apparently, it's doubtful that Shakespeare would have been aware of this. Even so, it's not entirely a coincidence. While Shakespeare wouldn't have known about this taboo, the authors of his source material would have. He probably kept the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">Obfuscating Insanity</a> plot without understanding the societal context of it.
</li><li> The play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Brand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Brand">Brand</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikIbsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikIbsen">Henrik Ibsen</a> made an eerie prophecy concerning the consequences of British pollution reaching Norway, leading to dying forests and lakes. The play was written in 1866, while this problem became apparent in the 1980s. The accuracy of this passage is quite chilling:
<div class="indent">Britain's smoke-cloud sinks corroding <br/>On the land in noisome fume; <br/>Smirches all its tender bloom, <br/>All its gracious verdure dashes, <br/>Sweeping low with breath of bane, <br/>Stealing sunlight from the plain, <br/>Showering down like rain of ashes <br/>On the city of God's doom.

Indeed, Tom Naughton ate a high-fat diet which involved plenty of bacon and other foods cooked in fat, the result being that he could program into the night without getting tired. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">There is no excuse for Wario's "healthy" cup of sugar that has only a dash of coffee, though.</a>
</li><li> In <em>WarioWare: Touched!</em>, when Wario got a cold, he decided to eat garlic, his favorite food. Garlic is antiseptic and antiviral and therefore used in treating colds, which would explain why Wario never got a cold until that time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game came out in 2000, but takes place in 2052. It has, in certain areas, the New York City skyline as background scenery, but missing the Twin Towers. This was due to technical limitations where one half of the skybox texture - the half that just so happens to lack the Twin Towers - is mirrored over the other half rather than applying the full texture, but the explanation the developers gave is that they were destroyed in a terrorist attack some time in the game's past. This may have been an educated guess on their part, as the World Trade Center had been the target of a terrorist bombing back in 1993, but not nearly on a large enough scale to actually topple any of the buildings. As well, terrorism is a large part of the game's plot, so that explanation fits within the mythology, too.
</li><li> Another one that sort of adds a little uneasiness, in the mission where you save someone from a gas station, you can see the prices. At the time it may have represented something far off, as gas prices were on average about $1.20 and the game depicted gas prices at $3.58, for regular. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Cue 10-12 years later after the game's release and that's exactly where those gas prices are,</a> although the early 2015 drop in gas prices let us breathe easily.
</li><li> A most thought-provoking, or perhaps scary, example can be read on government-sponsored electronic bulletin boards across the game. One article found at the very beginning of the game tells readers to keep an eye out for terrorists and report any suspicious activities. The messages are clearly intended to be alarming signs of the dystopian state of the current government, both in the fear mongering "everyone can be a terrorist" message used to scare everyone into accepting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching">Big Brother</a> level of control the government has, and in the invasion of privacy advocated by suggesting a thorough background search on anyone who is a foreigner or has spent too much time on the net. Thus, it's rather shocking how close this came to actual suggestions put out shortly after 9/11 for 'how to spot a terrorist'. What are you supposed to think when your own government is now repeating word-for-word the dystopian messages we're told to watch out for?
</li><li> Its prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em>, mentions an oil crash in 2015. While we didn't have an oil crash, prices did fall significantly.

However, "Sayori" (さより) is an actual Japanese girls' name (as well as the name of the Japanese halfbeak fish), albeit an uncommon one, as seen with voice actress Sayori Ishizuka.
</li><li> One of the supporting characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hades">Hades</a></em> is Sisyphus, who is depicted as having mellowed out due to his eternal punishment and now lives a simple but happy life, taking the futility of his situation in good humor. Many fans assumed this was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to the Albert Camus essay on Sisyphus, who used Sisyphus's punishment as a metaphor for what he perceived as the futility and absurdity of the search for meaning. Camus claimed that once Sisyphus realized he would never reach the top, he would accept his place in the world and become content—in short, he'd take on the exact attitude shown by the Sisyphus in the game. However, the developers claimed to have never heard of it, meaning they reached the same conclusion as Camus independently.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HongKong97" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HongKong97">Hong Kong '97</a></em>, which was released in 1995 but takes place during the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997, involves the mainland Chinese resurrecting the deceased "Tong Shau Ping" (i.e., Deng Xiaoping) as a weapon against the player character. Deng Xiaoping was alive in 1995, but he did end up dying in 1997.
</li><li> A plot point late in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SplinterCell1">Splinter Cell</a></em> involves a missing cache of Americium-239, which the game makes a big enough deal about that it's implied that the bad guys are planning to use it for nuclear weapons. Americium-239 would actually be very bad for this purpose, between it not being a fissile isotope in the first place, its ridiculously-short half-life of less than 12 hours, and the fact that it decays via electron-capture, which produces no harmful radiation for use in a dirty bomb. Thing is, though, when it does decay, it turns into other isotopes that would be much more suitable for weaponization - 99.99% of it decays into Plutonium-239, and the remaining .01% eventually decays into Uranium-239, either of which would definitely warrant the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> sort of reaction the game assigns to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> introduced a new abilty for Sonic, the Drop Dash.

But even some of the lines they made up on the fly without any familiarity with the source material still managed to fit with the canon storyline, much to their surprise:
<ul><li> After Sonic and Shadow's fight on Prison Island in the Hero Story, Alfred (as Eggman) jokingly tells the pair that the island is about to blow up...and the other actors have to point out to him that it really <em>is</em> about to blow up. Cue repeated shouts of "OH MY GOD, I DIDN'T KNOW!" from Alfred as Prison Island explodes.
</li><li> In the Dark Story, when the Biolizard is unleashed, Eggman says "Shadow could have been a true beast, and now you shall die!". His VA is somewhat surprised to learn that this is, again, the actual plot.
</li><li> During the game's ending, where Shadow appears to have died, Rouge (voiced by Blue Lennox) calls Shadow "Hedgehog Jesus". Slightly later, while the recording session is being wrapped up, Blue wonders whether that means Shadow will come back to life and is immediately informed that he was indeed brought back in later games.

As it turns out, he was partially correct — in an interview, co-creator Jamie Hewlett said that he and Alan Martin had to animate several scenes because the producers forgot to film them.
</li><li> During his Disneycember review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfIchabodAndMrToad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfIchabodAndMrToad">The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad</a></em> he muses over how protagonist and hero Ichabod Crane is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">malicious jerk</a> and how Brom Bones, treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">The Bully</a> and antagonist, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainyFreeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainyFreeVillain">doesn't do anything particularly villainous</a> aside from antagonize the jerk Ichabod and could very well be a nice guy.

The reason likely <em>did</em> have to do with Winston's skin color, but not because of any racism on the part of the developers: older games were rather limited in their choice of color palettes purely by the technology of the time<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9bwqu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9bwqu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9bwqu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, the Nintendo Entertainment System effectively had 56 colors to choose from, which could each be tinted to a degree, and could have four sprite and four background palettes active at any time. Each of these palettes was limited to three colors and one transparency, and any one object could only draw from a single palette. This often forced developers to resort to cleverness like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> overlapping multiple sprites, thus reducing the number of available sprites on the screen, just to provide six colors to draw from instead of three, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> series having black backgrounds behind massive bosses to use the transparency as an extra color.

The developers likely felt it wasn't worth it to devote extra color palettes just for the sake of an extra cosmetically different but otherwise identical character to play as, and just stuck to the three characters who could reasonably share a single color palette. Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">the quality</a> of these games (like AVGN said), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnieHudson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErnieHudson">Ernie Hudson</a> was probably relieved if anything to have been left out of those games anyways.

Finding a diamond proves easy; the problem is that it's about the size of a hill, which obviously makes it too big to use. So how does he get a small enough diamond out of that?

<ul><li> The episode "The Cyber House Rules" features the line, "This jigsaw of a pacifier factory makes me want to have children with you even more." Originally the line was "This jigsaw of a barn makes me want to have children with you even more." By coincidence, the Swedish word for children is <em>barn</em>, a cognate of the archaic English "bairn" when means "children" (and found in the Scots language). "Bairn" is etymologically related to "born". Maybe the joke was cut because it was esoteric, even for a show that often has jokes about science and math that no one would get unless they were college or grad school-educated. The Scottish terrier from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp">Lady and the Tramp</a></em> refers to the new baby as a "wee bairn", so obscure but not unknown.
</li><li> In "T: The Terrestrial", Leela informs Bender that, contrary to his expectations, the Planet Express ship has no cloaking devices or any stealth technology that could get them past a blockade (save for a can of spray paint).

The episode right before Germany's semi-final match against Brazil had the Germans completely ridicule their opponents, suggesting they'd win by the absurd margin of 6-0. The writers certainly didn't expect them to win 7-1 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.

She then smashes Johnny's head into the case and it breaks. Not only is this exactly what would happen in real life (diamond is extremely hard, and therefore resistant to cutting, but is also brittle and will shatter if hit hard enough), the way the case shatters is pretty accurate too (it doesn't break into shards like glass, but seems to crumble to dust: when diamond shatters it breaks along crystal planes into multiple tiny diamonds rather than shattering like glass).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>, Peggy once claims that "Swiss cheese is not Mexican, it is American." The kind of Swiss cheese she's most likely talking about, which is sold in American stores labeled simply "Swiss cheese," <em>is</em> an American recipe that's just based (and quite loosely) on a Swiss one—Emmentaler, to be specific.

However, the punchline of his story, which involved a scientist inadvertently discovering a way to quickly calculate extremely large prime numbers, would actually have pretty terrifying implications in real life, as such an algorithm could be used to break most modern data encryption methods, making hacking, identity theft, and other cyber crimes incredibly easy, as there would be no effective way to protect your data.

<ul><li> In the commentary for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS1E11TheCrepesOfWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS1E11TheCrepesOfWrath">The Crepes of Wrath</a>", the writers note that the bit about adding antifreeze to wine was a parody of an <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_diethylene_glycol_wine_scandal">incident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where some wine was found contaminated with antifreeze, but that, obviously, the contamination wasn't deliberate. Except that the contamination was discovered when a winery started listing antifreeze as a business expense, and it was very deliberately added to make the wine sweeter.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10ulbq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10ulbq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10ulbq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is definitely dangerous, though not as dangerous as it sounds. Ethylene glycol is indeed poisonous, but when mixed with sufficient quantities of ethanol, it passes harmlessly into urine. It's still more expensive than sugar or corn syrup, though.</span>
</li><li> While the writers may have known that a torus is one of the contenders for the shape of the universe, Homer certainly didn't know that when he told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking">Stephen Hawking</a> about his theory of a doughnut-shaped universe in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS10E22TheySavedLisasBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS10E22TheySavedLisasBrain">They Saved Lisa's Brain</a>".
</li><li> Abe Simpson once recalls his father talking about America being the greatest thing since sliced bread. He then says that sliced bread had been invented the previous winter. It was just meant as an "old fart" joke, but given that he served in WWII and the first commercial bread-slicing machine was invented in 1928, the writers were surprisingly accurate with this one.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E13TwoBadNeighbors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E13TwoBadNeighbors">Two Bad Neighbors</a>", Homer attempts to prank <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">George H. W. Bush</a> with cardboard cut-outs he identifies as "your sons, George Bush Jr. and Jeb Bush". In the audio commentary for that episode, it's said that the writers had no idea that there really <em>is</em> a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George Bush Jr.</a>" and the line was supposed to be an example of Homer being stupid. Stupider like a fox, it seems.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E17BartToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E17BartToTheFuture">Bart to the Future</a>" (airdate March 19, 2000), future President Lisa makes a reference to President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>—who, 16 years later, would indeed be elected the 45th <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePresidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePresidents">President of the United States of America</a>. At the time of the episode's airing, he had just ended an attempt to win a nomination of a third party, so the idea of his going from failed third-party candidate to elected president was perfect as a humorously far-fetched throwaway joke. The timeline of the episode implied that it'd take him over 20 years to make that transition, but in fact it only took him 17.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS17E21TheMonkeySuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS17E21TheMonkeySuit">The Monkey Suit</a>", Bart stars in a stage adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grease2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Grease2">Grease 2</a></em>. Eight years later <em>Grease 2</em> was adapted into the stage musical, <em>Cool Rider</em>.
</li><li> Santa's Little Helper is a two-fold case of this. One is he's a somewhat lazy ex-racer Greyhound. Rather than go with the normal "always energetic and fast" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DogStereotype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DogStereotype">Dog Stereotype</a> attributed to the breed, he's a "normal" laidback dog. This is actually accurate to Greyhounds, and especially former racing dogs. Aside from when they're on walks, they tend to be very relaxed. Greyhounds were bred for short spurts of running, not being energetic constantly. Two is his backstory that he was abandoned by his owner after a long string of losses. Much to the surprise of the writers, this actually <em>is</em> a common plight of racing dogs, and they were praised by animal rights groups for bringing mainstream attention to it: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a> later explained in an interview that he had no idea this was an issue but was happy they were able to raise awareness of it.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E16LisaTheIconoclast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E16LisaTheIconoclast">Lisa the Iconoclast</a>" featured the term "embiggen" as a nonsensical word (or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyCromulentWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectlyCromulentWord">Perfectly Cromulent Word</a>), but the writers later learned that the word "embiggen" had been used by writer C.A. Ward in 1884.
</li><li> In the "Treehouse Of Horror XIII" story "The Island Of Dr. Hibbert", where Ned Flanders takes pleasure and relief in getting milked when his lower half got transformed into the body of a cow, which actually is a valid reaction. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalGenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalGenderBender">As for why that half of his body is female, though...</a>
</li><li> In "Dead Putting Society" Lisa asks Bart "What is the sound of one hand clapping", to which Bart immediately holds up a hand and smacks his fingers against the palm to Lisa's frustration. Though it was meant to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhetoricalQuestionBlunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhetoricalQuestionBlunder">Rhetorical Question Blunder</a>, this is actually very close to an <em>actual</em> answer to the koan: simply holding up one's hand with the fingers out.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E1BeyondBlunderdome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E1BeyondBlunderdome">Beyond Blunderdome</a>" (1999), Homer misleads <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelGibson">Mel Gibson</a> into doing a hyper-violent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrSmithGoesToWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrSmithGoesToWashington">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a></em> that includes a scene where Smith impales a rival with an American flag. The sequence is presented as being completely over-the-top ridiculous and the movie is implied to ruin Gibson's career irreparably. One year later, the real Gibson released <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePatriot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePatriot">The Patriot</a></em>, where his main character (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBadassUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBadassUpgrade">actionized counterpart</a> of a real historical figure) uses an American flag as a pike to bring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeTossingCharge">main villain's horse</a> down during the final battle before killing him. And it's supposed to be taken seriously.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E17HomerAtTheBat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E17HomerAtTheBat">Homer at the Bat</a>" features a gag where the Springfield P.D. arrests Steve Sax. Sax attempts to ask for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePhoneCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePhoneCall">One Phone Call</a>, which is brushed off as "you watch too many movies." While the joke is obviously that the police are needlessly brutal and corrupt (demonstrated by the fact that they charged Sax with <em>every unsolved murder in New York City</em>, based solely on the fact that he claimed to be from there), they're right that the old "one phone call" isn't a thing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> did an episode with a character called Sexual Harassment Panda that satirized how difficult subjects (like sexual harassment) are often presented to children in a sugar-coated manner. Turns out <a class="urllink" href="http://www.deltadentalnj.com/company/panda.shtml">there is a program called P.A.N.D.A.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that deals with how to deal with sexual harassment at both school and work.

<ul><li> Technically a subvertion, but there is an ancient Sumerian clay tablet (officially named Cylinder Seal VA 243), which has a picture of the sun in the upper left corner surrounded by 9 dots. Many people claim it's a map of the solar system and they successfully guessed there were nine planets <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note112182');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note112182" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note112182');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Yes, there's technically only eight, but that wasn't considered the case when the tablet was discovered </span>. That said, most scholars now think the dots just represent the various Sumerian deities. Also, while the tablet has writing on it, it just says Dubsiga, Ili-illat, your/his servant. Whereas one would think if it's a map of the solar system there would be writing saying this.
</li><li> The Greek philospher Empedocles first came up with the whole idea of the four classical elements (air, earth, fire, and water). While this doesn't fit the modern definition of "element" (in the context of chemistry), it does map on rather well to the four basic states of matter (i.e earth:solid, water:liquid, air:gas and fire:plasma.)
