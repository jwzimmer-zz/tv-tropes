<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em>, Tokagero states his mother had given him "her own flesh" so he would survive. A little bit later on the story, we find out he really meant it.
</li><li> During Sanji's flashback in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, he and the pirate Zeff are stranded at sea for over two months. Though Sanji rationed his share of the food they'd washed ashore with, it only lasts him 25 days. 45 days later, young Sanji tries to kill Zeff and take his seemingly large remaining share of food, only to find that it was all treasure, and the pirate chef had been forced to eat his own foot at the beginning of their time stranded, secretly giving Sanji all the food to keep the boy alive. It's a horrifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">reveal</a> for the boy and pretty clearly illustrates why he stays with the "old crap-geezer". In the anime adaption, the chef cuts off his foot in his attempt to save Sanji because it was trapped, and spends the whole time eating nothing.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KinosJourney">Kino's Journey</a></em>, Kino encounters some snowed-in traders. Almost starving to death, they had eaten their cargo. Turns out they were slavers. Connect the dots...
</li><li> It's heavily implied by a flashback in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> that Allelujah engaged in this as a boy, during an early appearance of his evil split personality, Hallelujah. Allejuah was trapped on a ship with his fellow tykebombs, and they had no food and were starving to death. Cut to a grinning Hallejuah with blood dripping down his shirt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Asura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Asura">Asura</a></em>. The Kanshō famine forced the titular character's <strong>own mother</strong> to try to eat him when he was just a baby. Asura himself performed cannibalism as a means of survival until he met a monk. Eight years had passed. <strong>Eight years of pure human flesh and blood.</strong>
</li><li> Priscilla from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>. After she killed her yoma infected father, she was trapped in their house for a month and is implied to have eaten part of his corpse.
</li><li> This trope is suggested as part of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Senshi</span>'s backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>. After being stranded in the dungeon for many days, his crew was whittled down to three people and starving to death. His comrades left the room, there was a loud struggle, and then only one of them came back. It was ambiguous whether he butchered a monster or another dwarf. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It is ultimately subverted, however, as Laius deduces that the meat Senshi ate was actually hippogriff.</span>

<ul><li> "Casket Canyon" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonahHex">Jonah Hex</a></em> #66. A town cut off by a blizzard resorts to cannibalism. Some of the inhabitants quickly descend into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">I'm a Humanitarian</a> territory.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PocketGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PocketGod">Pocket God</a></em> issue #23, half of the tribe is trekking through the desert with their provisions running low. Kinsee gets so hungry, she considers eating one the other pygmies. While they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">resurrect from death</a>, they keep her from doing it because they don't want to be cannibals.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a></em>, a bunch of evil alternate Invincibles were manipulated by Angstrom Levy, who sent them to a desolate wasteland with nothing in it but sand when he was through. Much later, we see what happened to them: at first, they killed and ate the least popular guy because everyone was starving, but one of them went insane and started killing and eating all the others.
</li><li> The Decepticons under Starscream's command have degenerated to this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTransformersIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheTransformersIDW">The Transformers (IDW)</a></em>, killing each other for parts and energon. Megatron is not amused when sees his troops in this condition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>: During Necropolis, when the entire city was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNightThatNeverEnds">covered in a black fog</a> by the Dark Judges and the Sisters of Death, citizens in the worst areas had to resort to cannibalism to survive. Dredd later runs into two women who had been driven insane and started killing people after their father had offered himself to give his daughters a chance to live through it.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VandalSavage">Vandal Savage</a> discovered that his regenerative immortality was failing him, and all his secret organ banks had been dismantled by Lex Luthor's Society, he briefly attempted to spend the last of his days trying to kill the original Green Lantern. When this failed, and he was left alone in the rubble of his base with only a clone of himself he created as part of the plan, he ended up eating the clone, both for food and to restore his immortality.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersOngoing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersOngoing">Transformers Ongoing</a></em>, Megatron's defeat at the hands of Optimus Prime results in Starscream taking over. Thanks to his incompetence as a leader, the Decepticons are left stranded on an asteroid with no resources, and quickly are reduced to killing each other for energon and spare parts.

However, because the film is also a take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wendigo">wendigo</a> myth, anyone who eats other people gains that person's strength/life force, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that can overcome virtually all injuries or disease... and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">Horror Hunger</a> that compels them to continue eating more people. The film's villain is the last survivor of that pioneer group, and who, after eating everyone else in the group, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">superhumanly strong</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">tough</a>, and absolutely determined to continue devouring others.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalTheMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalTheMusical">Cannibal! The Musical</a></em>, a musical based on Alfred Packer's journey brought to you by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TreyParkerAndMattStone">the creators</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> with all of their usual good taste.
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gulag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gulag">Gulag</a></em>, when the prisoners are planning their escape, it is suggested that they take a 'sandwich' with them; that is, someone weak who will probably die on the ice so they will be able to eat him.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson">Peter Jackson</a> take on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</a></em> has a horde of Uruk-Hai who, after days of cross-country running, powered by moldy bread, start eyeing their Hobbit cargo, which they were explicitly ordered to not harm in any way. They end up settling for one of their own. This does not suppose that the Uruk-Hai have anything remotely resembling refined tastes in cuisine.
<ul><li> By this point the warband is composed of both Uruk-Hai and regular orcs, the ones that look more scrawny and hunch over. The orcs want to carve up the Hobbits but the scene plays up the discipline of the Uruk-Hai since Saruman ordered them to bring them back "alive and unspoiled". Of course, an orc being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">an orc</a>, he draws his blade on the much stronger Uruk-Hai and gets his head chopped up for his trouble. Well, would you look at that, two birds with one stone. "Looks like meat's back on our menu, boys!"
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBloodyValentine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBloodyValentine">My Bloody Valentine</a></em> it's revealed Harry Warden ate his companions while trapped in the collapsed mine. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBloodyValentine3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBloodyValentine3D">The remake</a> downgrades this into killing them to conserve oxygen.

Then, just as the lead ex-pioneer is in the middle of being horrified that they're eating the missing member of their party, the assumed roast walks up and asks if anyone's seen his cow.

The children managed to survive by eating fungus and any of their own dead, and still remember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">the yummy taste</a> their parents used to give them, interpreting it as an act of love. The tribe's later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a> moment only serves to increase the horror.

Later, they descend into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">I'm a Humanitarian</a> territory, and use forced-cannibalism ("You can eat it, or you can be eaten. Your choice.") as a sadistic recruiting tool, since cannibalism "indelibly marks a person, on their soul", making said persons permanently pariah with any "decent" folk.
<ul><li> Pretty much the exact same thing happens in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emberverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emberverse">Emberverse</a> novel, <em>Dies the Fire,</em> where the sudden collapse of infrastructure (including the end of guns) leaves most people with no stockpiles of food and no ability to hunt food. Well, most food except for a certain large animal that has two legs and is easily caught... After the "Eaters" descend into active hunting, they are pretty much killed on sight and shown no quarter, even by the titular good factions.

It also comes up in the narrative proper when he crosses paths with <em>another</em> stranded shipwreck victim, who pretends to be friendly just to get him to come close and then tries to kill and eat him. The tiger's name, Richard Parker, is a reference to the coincidence that multiple people with that name have happened to be involved in real cases of mutiny, shipwrecking and/or cannibalism.

On one of the albums, the Lifeboat Sketch is followed by an irate phone call from a Royal Navy officer who objects to the suggestion of cannibalism in the Navy, on the grounds that "the Navy now has the problem relatively under control," and it's now apparently the R.A.F which has a cannibalism-related problem.

The disheveled man keeps asking what the great tasting meat dish is and the other finally says "It's you. More specifically, it's your right leg. Go on, take a look." At this point, the man looks down to see his right leg amputated and Allison wakes up. Later on, it's revealed that both men were part of a group of Vietnam POWs who ate another soldier who was dying so they could survive.

<ul><li> 'Timothy' by The Buoys is a song about three miners trapped in a cave-in, and only two of them are eventually rescued. The third miner, the eponymous 'Timothy' is missing. In the second verse, the narrator says that he's 'hungry as hell, no food to eat' and that his colleague Joe said he'd 'sell his soul for just a piece of meat'. The third verse describes how the narrator blacks out, and awakens when he's rescued, saying that his 'stomach was full as it could be and nobody ever got around to finding Timothy'. It's implied that the narrator and Joe ate Timothy before they were rescued. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0aood');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0aood" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0aood');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One explanation has been offered that Timothy was a mule, not a person.

In May 1846, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortCutsMakeLongDelays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortCutsMakeLongDelays">took a shortcut that turned out to be a longcut</a>, which left them in the position of trying to cross the Sierra Nevada mountain range during a very harsh winter. By October 1846, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowedIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnowedIn">Snowed-In</a> high up in the Sierras, atop what later was named Donner Pass. When the food ran out (which didn't take long), many of the party resorted to eating their dead (there were allegations that some members didn't wait for people to die of natural causes). While most everybody chose to wait it out, a party of messengers set out to seek help; they reached civilization in January. It took four separate rescue parties to evacuate the remaining survivors, the last of whom did not reach shelter until April 1847. Interestingly, it turns out that one of the Washoe tribes in the region actually encountered the Donners after they were snowed in and attempted to aid them with gifts of food, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">but were driven off by gunfire</a>. Between this and observations of acts of cannibalism among the Party, the Washoes simply avoided them.
</li><li> In 1845, a British Naval expedition attempting to find the fabled "Northwest Passage" through the Arctic, under the command of Captain John Franklin, ended in disaster, with the loss of both ships and all 129 men. While the exact circumstances of their fate are unknown, various search expeditions over a century later found scattered clues left behind from the voyage. In 1992, a modern expedition found a mass grave of the crew on King's Island, Canada, containing over 400 bones. Forensic testing of the bones showed conclusive evidence that the at least some of the crew had resorted to cannibalism in their final days.
</li><li> A more modern well-known case is the story of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguayan_Air_Force_Flight_571">Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3d4eq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3d4eq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3d4eq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually a civilian chartered flight flown by the Air Force.</span> often referred to in pop culture, incorrectly, as "that soccer team that crashed in the mountains". Basically a rugby team chartered a flight from Uruguay to Chile and as a result of the pilots miscalculating their position, they crashed in the middle of the Andes mountains. Because the pilots had given their position incorrectly, search and rescue planes were unable to find them. With no food available, they were forced to eat the dead (their friends and family) to survive. A few were unable to bring themselves to do this and died of starvation. Luckily they were able to hike out and get rescued. Only 16 of the 45 crew and passengers survived, having spent a total of 72 days in the mountains. Popularly dramatized in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Alive">Alive</a>!</em>
</li><li> The case of R v. Dudley and Stephens, where three shipwrecked sailors in a lifeboat murdered a fourth, started eating him and were rescued less than a week later. It's often taught in law-related classes, both because it established the important historical precedent that necessity is not grounds for justifiable homicide<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4rg16');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4rg16" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4rg16');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Precedent establishes that necessity is a positive defense to cannibalizing a corpse provided that the victim was <em>already dead</em></span> and because the teachers probably figure that at least it's one case the students are sure to remember.
</li><li> The other well-known case of cannibalism at sea occurred in the boats from the whale-hunter <em>Essex</em> (which was rammed and sunk by a whale on November 20, 1820; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Melville didn't make that up</a>). Though the crew was able to pack some provisions prior to leaving their sinking ship in three small whaleboats, their food soon ran out. Following a brief stop at the unoccupied Henderson Island, the boats headed out to sea again in hope of finding rescue, where the crew were forced to resort to cannibalism as the men began dying off. On one boat, containing four men (one of them the ship's captain, George Pollard), the situation was so dire that the men decided they couldn't wait for someone to die in order to avoid universal starvation. They chose to draw lots to determine who would die, and then drew lots again to determine who the executioner would be. Only two of the three whaleboats were found by passing ships, containing five survivors. Another three men who had chosen to stay on Henderson Island were later picked up as well, for a total of eight survivors out of the 20-man crew. After the rescues, the officers in charge of the boat went back to sea and had little difficulty filling their crews, which is usually taken as a sign that their actions were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">accepted as necessary</a>.
<ul><li> Ironically, the boats took a longer way to the land (southwards and then eastwards to South America instead of Marquesas Islands lying to the west) because the sailors feared that the islands might be inhabited by cannibal tribes.
</li></ul></li><li> Survivors of the Dutch ship <em>Rooseboom</em>, which was sunk by a Japanese submarine while carrying troops and civilians being evacuated from Singapore in February 1942, may have resorted to cannibalism as they drifted for nearly 1,000 miles in an overcrowded lifeboat.
</li><li> In fact resorting to cannibalism was prevalent enough that in England it was given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemism</a> of "The Custom of the Sea."
</li><li> In Russia after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a>. During the Russian Civil War, there were many reports of starving villages (their crops having been taken by the Red and White armies) eating their dead or even selling salted body parts.
</li><li> It happened in the Ukraine during <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor">the Holodomor,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a horrific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFamine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFamine">famine</a> from 1932-1933, caused by Stalin's forced collectivization policy. By some accounts it was so common that signs were posted reading, "Eating Dead Children Is Barbaric".
</li><li> An urban legend said this was commonplace in the mid to late forties in Germany (both East and West). Multiple versions exist, some detail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">people willingly choosing to sacrifice themselves or their relatives</a>, while others detail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">cannibal gangs roaming the streets at night preying on homeless people, drunks, or schoolchildren who stayed out too late</a>.

The mass chaos caused by the outbreak of the war, and the speed of the German advance, resulted in the city facing a severe lack of food stores when the Germans arrived and closed off land access. The NKVD made 2015 arrests. Students of boarding 'Trade Schools' and single-parent families disproportionately affected. Rations had been reduced to 1000 calories daily for children and workers in 'non-essential' industries - versus 1500 calories daily for soldiers and workers in essential industries (survival ration 2000 calories daily). Those arrested 64% female, 44% unemployed, 90% illiterate or ill-educated, 2% with (previous) criminal record - in other words, ordinary housewives. Majority merely 'corpse-eaters', consumers of flesh of those dead of starvation or natural causes - of 300 arrested in March 1942, only 44 arrested for crime of 'person-eating' (i.e. murder and consumption of another). No official distinction in sentencing between 'corpse-eaters' and 'person-eaters', but in practice 'person-eaters' almost certainly all executed.
<ul><li> First cases on 13/12/1941: Mother smothered 18-month-old daughter to feed self and three older children; 26 y.o. man, fired from tyre-factory, murdered and ate 18 y.o. room-mate; metalworker (and Party member) and son killed two female refugees with a hammer, hid body parts in shed; unemployed plumber killed wife to feed teenage son and nieces, hiding remains in toilets of Lenenergo workers' hostel.
</li><li> Senior supply officer Vasili Yershov of 56th Rifle Division, 55th Army, (stationed in Leningrad district): "In early January 1942, the divisional commander started getting urgent calls from regimental and battalion commanders, saying that this or that group of soldiers hadn't been fed, that the [divisional] carrier hadn't appeared with his canteen [containing the soup-ration], having apparently been killed by German snipers. Thorough checks revealed that [...] soldiers were leaving their trenches early in the morning to meet the carriers, stabbing them to death, and taking the food [...] cutting off pieces of human flesh and eating those too. To give you some idea of the numbers I can tell you that in my division [Soviet combat unit with average of 7000 men, total Soviet combat forces in Leningrad district c.300,000 men] in the winter of 1941-2, on the front line alone - taking no account of units in the rear - there were about twenty such cases."
</li></ul></li><li> Alferd (or Alfred) Packer was an incompetent mountain guide who ate the rest of his party when they became snowbound in the Rockies due to his bad organization. At his trial, the judge lamented: "There were only seven Democrats in Hinsdale County and you ate five of them!" The student canteen at the University of Colorado (Boulder) is the Alfred Packer Grill; motto: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Have a friend for lunch</a>."
<ul><li> Accounts vary regarding the exact circumstances of the event (not surprising, as Packer was the sole survivor). Authorities believed he murdered them all himself, while Packer always maintained that it was a partymate who murdered the others and tried to kill Packer himself before he was able to kill him in self-defense, with the cannibalism a simple matter of survival. Amusingly, after serving a 40 year sentence for manslaughter <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5dmp8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5dmp8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5dmp8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Packer was initially tried and convicted of murder, but the conviction was overturned on constitutional grounds, and Packer was re-tried on a lesser charge</span>, Packer was said to have been a vegetarian for the rest of his life.

</li><li> When the French frigate <em>Medusa</em> ran aground in 1816, the upperclass passengers were loaded into the lifeboats, while the remaining 150 sailors, traders and labourers were forced onto a makeshift raft. Fearful that the desperate survivors would slow them down, the lifeboat passengers soon cut the tow ropes and set the raft adrift in the open ocean. Violence, mayhem and cannibalism soon overran the helpless raft, and only fifteen people survived to be rescued. This horrific incident was immortalized by Theodore Gericault in his 1818-19 mural <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa">The Raft of the Medusa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.
</li><li> There's widespread evidence that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheRich">cannibalism against the wealthy and educated</a> was practiced in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,160807,00.html">China's Guangxi province<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReignOfTerror">Cultural Revolution</a>. It's vehemently denied by the Chinese government (naturally), but cheerfully acknowledged by (some) residents of the province.

It's also been alleged to have happened during other periods of famine in the last several decades.

As described in C. V. Wedgwood's <em>The Thirty Years' War</em>:
<div class="indent"><em>"In Alsace the bodies of criminals were torn from the gallows and devoured; in the whole Rhineland they watched the graveyards against marauders who sold the flesh of the newly buried for food; at Zweibrucken a woman confessed to having eater her child. In Fulda and Coburg and near Frankfurt and the great refugee camp, men went in terror of being killed and eaten by those maddened by hunger."</em>
</div></li><li> There are many <a class="urllink" href="http://history.org/Foundation/journal/Winter07/jamestownSide.cfm">accounts of cannibalism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the Jamestown colony in Virginia during the "starving time" of 1609-10. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/skeleton-of-teenage-girl-confirms-cannibalism-at-jamestown-colony/2013/05/01/5af5b474-b1dc-11e2-9a98-4be1688d7d84_story.html">Recently unearthed remains<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the colony site of a 14-year-old girl whose body was butchered with knives and cleavers after her death reveal that the Jamestown colonists did indeed resort to cannibalism.
</li><li> Ref. Monty Python sketch where an irate Royal Navy officer insists that "we're dealing with it - it's the bloody RAF who have got the problem!" (See above). In 1942, Fleet Air Arm officer Lieut. Charles Lamb was in a prisoner-of-war camp run by the Vichy French. As camp provost (in charge of discipline among prisoners) he interviewed a newly-arrived Royal Air Force crew, who the French had discovered drifting in the Med for over a month after being shot down. Lamb remarked that their make of plane normally has a four man crew but only three had arrived as prisoners. The three survivors looked at each other, and confessed to Lamb there had indeed been a wounded fourth crew member. At least at first...
</li><li> During the island hopping campaigns of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WorldWarII/WarInAsiaAndThePacific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WorldWarII/WarInAsiaAndThePacific">War in Asia and the Pacific</a> for more details), Japanese soldiers were known to resort to this. Their supply lines were typically poor, especially with any Japanese attempt to reinforce them by sea or air being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">frequently frustrated</a> by US Air Force and Naval blockades. As a result, deceased comrades would be eaten. To make it more horrific, however, this was a fate that befell some unfortunate POW's, some of whom were still alive when subjected to this treatment. One infamous case was when the Japanese garrison on the island of Chichi Jima executed and ate Navy fliers who were shot down. (Freakishly enough, the one pilot who was rescued by the US Navy was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">George H. W. Bush</a>). 30 of the Japanese garrison were tried, and five convicted. It has also been alleged that instead of being killed straight away, some were kept alive - to keep the meat fresh.
</li><li> According to medieval chronicles, the knights participating in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">the First Crusade</a> were so hungry and undersupplied at the Siege of Ma'arra that they resorted to eating meat from the backsides of slain Saracen warriors, and even "when it was not yet roasted enough by the fire, they devoured it". Some sources, including <em>Cracked</em>, even claim that the knights <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatsBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatsBabies">roasted and ate babies</a>!</em>
</li><li> This was the "Modest Proposal" suggested in Jonathan Swift's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AModestProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AModestProposal">essay of the same name.</a>
