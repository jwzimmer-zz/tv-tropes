<ul><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">completionist</a> who's ever played the game has spent untold additional hours getting the stray beads. Specifically, a set of three beads requires you to fight through a total of thirty demon gates in groups of ten each. The first two sets aren't bad... fifteen minutes to half an hour each depending on your skills. The third one however is at least an hour and a half of the toughest enemies in the game, below bosses. You can't save, and if you leave after finishing any gates you have to start the stage over.
</li><li> Oni Island, the fifth dungeon, is the longest in the game. Lots of racing segments, tricky obstacles, fairly tough enemy battles, and a difficult boss. Even getting to the place takes a while.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a></em> has at least one: the infamous "Welcome to the Machine" from the first game.

One wrong move and you get an Ecco pancake and have to start over. The wonky controls don't help either.

To compensate this, only the first 30 floors are mandatory to beat the game, as the other 20 lead to an optional prize.

It's a huge, sprawling maze of a place full of puzzles (both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlockPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlockPuzzle">block</a> and otherwise) and the creepy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallCrawl">wall-climbing</a> Zephonim vampires. It takes about two hours to complete if you know what you're doing, and it's only the <em>second</em> stage of the game. And that's the final version. It was supposed to be even longer, but a good portion of the Cathedral was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> due to various reasons.

</li><li> The Dark Tower, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeDDotGameHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThreeDDotGameHeroes">3D Dot Game Heroes</a></em> has seven full-sized floors, the first six of which make you fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">one of the previous temple bosses</a> at the end. Luckily, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore">warp portals at every odd-numbered floor</a> that bring you back to the entrance of the tower to allow you to replenish your supplies.
</li><li> The various Dark Realm levels from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Onimusha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Onimusha">Onimusha</a></em> but particularly the version in the fourth game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnimushaDawnOfDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnimushaDawnOfDreams">Dawn of Dreams</a></em>. In most of the prior games, the Dark Realm consisted of at most 20 or so levels. Not only does <em>Dawn of Dreams</em> have <strong>100</strong> levels, but starting somewhere in the 20s those levels will either have replacement mooks, (so you kill one type of genma, and another of the same sort will appear out of nowhere to take it's place) and second or even third waves of enemies, so after finally wiping out all the starting demons and the ones that replaced them, suddenly a whole fresh wave of them will attack you and you'll have to start the process all over again. Successfully completing all 100 levels will require at least 3-4 hours of dedicated time. By the time you get to the later levels, it becomes obvious that the game isn't trying to throw enemies at you that are too powerful to handle, mostly it's just trying to get the player to run out of their valuable supplies, and mentally/physically exhaust them into making small but critical mistakes that will get them killed. There's also no way to save progress inside the Dark Realm, so you have to do it from start to finish in one shot, and if you want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, all five of the characters in your party will need to go through all 100 levels by themselves. Good luck.

It's 21km long, and the real-world lap record is 6 minutes and 25 seconds. The endurance circuit, which combines the Nordschleife with the GP track, is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">26km</a></em> long with a lap record of over <em>8</em> minutes.
</li><li> <em>BAJA: Edge of Control</em> has <em>3-hour long</em> BAJA 1000 races. Keep in mind that these races are on extremely rough terrain, with trucks that require players to monitor heat, clutch damage, and suspension damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em>:

So long, a controller pack usually doesn't have enough memory to save a track ghost. It can take up to two minutes to complete a lap. And you have to do three laps. When the track was remastered for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em>, it was made a lot shorter, by making you only do one lap around the course, divided into three segments.
</li><li> Another track in <em>64</em> is Wario Stadium, with the manual itself stating that its length will make it tough for players to stay concentrated in the race.
</li><li> The All Cup Tour in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDoubleDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDoubleDash">Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</a></em>, featuring all 16 tracks, which takes about 45 minutes to do on 50cc, and a bit less in faster difficulty levels. For individual racetracks, there's Wario Colosseum, whose length means that you only have to complete two laps around it instead of the usual three.
</li><li> Waluigi Pinball in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDS">Mario Kart DS</a></em> is the longest track in the entire game. Unlike most examples here however, the track itself is fairly straightforward to complete and actually fairly short when compared to most tracks in other Mario Kart games.
</li><li> Rainbow Road in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart7">Mario Kart 7</a></em> is long enough that it's also one long lap around the course, divided into three segments, rather than one whole lap. It's one of three courses in its game to be a three segment course rather than a three lap one, the others being the two Wuhu Island courses (Wuhu Loop, where you loop around Wuhu Island; and Maka Wuhu, where you drive up Maka Wuhu then glide back to the beach).
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo">Gran Turismo</a></em> series, as well as the Nürburging, features the fictional (but based on a real location in Spain) Circuito de la Sierra (about 27km).

</li><li> Then there are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">endurance races</a>. The shortest consists of 30 laps around Special Stage Route 11 in the first game, which will take a little under an hour. The longest are the 24 Hours of Le Mans and 24 Hours of Nürburgring, both of which are in <em>5</em> only. Your best bet is to either get some friends to help you out, pause the game after running for 2 hours and leave the console on for several days in a row, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking">use B-Spec mode</a>, which shortens the race to a more bearable 8 hours when sped up. It also lets the AI do all the driving, so you can do something else while your B-Spec driver does the racing, but you still gotta be there so you can tell him to actually pit. <em>4</em> also has the 1000 miles! series, a series of four 250-mile endurance races that take at least three hours each.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectCARS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectCARS">Project CARS</a></em> makes races incredibly long to even start with long practice and qualification sessions depending on what you set it to. An average Career race at 100% time progression can take half an hour just for practice (then again that extra time can really help set up your car and pit strategy), a quarter hour for qualification and the main race being anywhere between ten and fifteen laps. Then you get to some of the specific endurance events such as the 3-Hour McLaren F1 Challenge that, even at 1%, will still take half an hour. Then there's Endurance races that take up to <em>twelve hours</em>, and then finally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwentyFourHoursOfLeMans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwentyFourHoursOfLeMans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> that takes this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> that puts you in a race for, well, twenty four hours.

If you are skilled and don't crash on any car or barrier, this doesn't need 15 minutes to finish, but even for a Ferrari vehicle, driving this way would render a serious issue.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a></em> has the Metropolitian Highway (Tokyo) time attack course, which combines all four Tokyo courses into a 60 km romp and takes over 12 minutes to complete with a fully-tuned car. <em>Maximum Tune 3</em> adds the Kanagawa version, which is a 35 km runthrough of Yokohane Line and Wangan Line that takes about 7 minutes to complete with the same kind of car; <em>Maximum Tune 4</em> expands this to also cover the Minato Mirai route for a 48 km ride that takes a little over 9 minutes. The Japanese version of <em>Maximum Tune 5</em> has the Sub-Center version which is just slightly under <em>70 kilometers</em> long and takes nearly 15 minutes to finish, again with a full-tuned vehicle! <br/><br/>Due to their lengths, playing one of these courses requires you to insert an additional credit. As shown in an alert when you choose these courses in <em>Maximum Tune 3</em> onwards, <em>DO NOT</em> allow another player to challenge you while racing either of these courses, or you will lose the additional credit you inserted and have to insert credits again to take another shot at either course.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalRacing">Fatal Racing</a></em>'s 3rd bonus race takes around 15 minutes to finish on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyModeMockery">Girlie mode</a>... and over 40 minutes on a good day on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Impossible</a>, with low damage. Every other course can be finished (1st place, all laps done) in under 15 minutes on Impossible, even with high damage and a full house of 16 cars (15 or 14 computers). It is highly suspected that this is due to a mistake in the course's configuration.
<ul><li> This is also one of the few tracks with unavoidable damage due to long jumps and the <em>only</em> track with moving ramps that can tilt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">beyond the vertical</a>, causing you to ricochet off the walls and slam into the ground upside down in the middle of a very narrow track with no room for the other drivers to avoid you (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitefulAI">not that they care</a>). In short, unless you are playing on low damage (which defeats the point of the game) you either run out of lives and die in the first three or so laps or you survive only to see everyone else run out of lives and die, leaving you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">alone on the track for the next half an hour</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most licensed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> games allow you to go the full distance of the real-life races, which all total up to around 190 miles (with the exception of Monaco, which <em>still</em> ends up being one of the longest races on the calendar just because it's slow). Furthermore, while real-world F1 races will time-out after two hours, not every F1 game includes this rule.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza">Forza Motorsport</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first three games had endurance races. In the first, the average time to complete one was about 45 minutes. The second bumped this up to an hour, and the third made it about 65-70 minutes. The two longest ones in <em>3</em> were the 17 lap (238 km) Le Mans race and 187 km Nürburgring race, the two tracks that are already marathon courses in their own right.
</li><li> A limited-time only multiplayer lobby in <em>4</em> had players race at Le Mans (which is by no means short) for <em>three hundred and sixty laps</em>. The absolute fastest lap time recorded is 3 minutes, 6 seconds. That's at least <em>eighteen hours</em> of racing, six hours short of the Le Mans 24h.

</li><li> The <em>Horizon</em> spinoff series isn't exempt either. The "Horizon Finale" event in <em>2</em> has you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheWorldsAreAStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTheWorldsAreAStage">driving through every town in the game in one super-circuit.</a> The "Goliath Circuit" in <em>3</em> (which shows up once you level Byron Bay up to level 5) is a similar trek.
</li><li> <em>7</em> has the "Survival of the Fastest" achievement, for which you have to win the Spa-Francorchamps 100 Showcase Event with the race length set to Extra Long, which is 69 laps for this course, or up to three hours. Better yet is the Sebring 300, the longest race in the Driver's Cup, whose Extra Long version is 243 laps, and can over 10 hours to complete.

<ul><li> <em>Need for Speed: Shift</em> has one set of races designed to infuriate anyone going for 100% completion: Endurance. It consists of 5 races: 3 of them are 10 laps on ostensibly long tracks (the famed Spa-Francorchamps being one of them), one of them is 30 laps on a tiny figure-eight track, and then 3 laps on the legendary Nordschleife. THEN you get to challenge the 'Endurance champion' to complete the race sets. Even with heavily modified Tier 3 vehicles, the entire thing will take you a good 2-3 hours.
</li><li> <em>Hot Pursuit</em> 2010 has Seacrest Tour, a roughly <em>44</em> mile race that will take a player likely 15 minutes to complete. It tends to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> if one should make too many mistakes.

Rainier Endurance race, the last of them all, where you have to cover 100 miles of offroading up and down mountainsides in a Muscle Car that is built for going offroad. It takes an hour and 15 minutes to finish. made worse by the level getting glitchy from the chunk loading process.
</li><li> The aptly named Gigatrack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trials">Trials</a> Evolution</em>. In a game where 2 minutes is normally the average track length, this one can take well over 15 minutes to complete.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wipeout">Wipeout</a> HD</em> has an achievement for causing the Time Trial lap counter to roll over. It rolls over at 99 laps.
</li><li> At the end of every season in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GRiD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GRiD">GRiD</a>'s career mode you can race the (12 minute long) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwentyFourHoursOfLeMans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwentyFourHoursOfLeMans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a>, easily the longest, and toughest, race in career mode. If you're feeling up to it, you can actually do a quick race version that goes for anywhere from 12 minutes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderOfSteel">24 hours</a>, depending on how daring you're feeling.

The infamous Island Tour for example. You're very quick if you manage this 200-km (!) long race with a fully-tuned Saleen S7 TT or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacLaren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacLaren">Mac Laren</a> F1, both of which running up to around 262 MPH flat-out (and there's a lot of straights in the game) in less than half an hour. Or the Millionaires Challenge, another entire island tour - this time with a TIMER (that's set to an hour!) and TRAFFIC. Both of these races are nightmares. And then there's still the damn car delivery missions. Long tracks in high traffic and you lose a LOT of money if the car so much as get scratched. TDU is a good contester for being the king of Marathon Levels in racing games.
</li><li> Certain faction missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCrew">The Crew</a></em> can keep you on the road for upwards of an hour (with at least one mission lasting over two hours in length). The developer, Ivory Tower, is comprised of a number of talents who previously worked on the aforementioned <em>Test Drive Unlimited</em> series so there is some precedent for this. Particular standouts include Los Angeles's Highway Child, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">a run around the U.S. through the highways</a> clocking in at 1.5 hours, Miami's Showtime at 2, but the grand daddy of it all has to be Landmark Tour at Las Vegas.

It's the longest stage in the game. And, to date, also the longest ever stage in any rally game. How long? It's up to <em>59 in-game kilometers, and takes up to 25 minutes to complete</em> from start to finish. Yeah... The game has plenty of other long stages too (though none approaching the length of this one), and there's a very good reason why the key for "Pause" is listed among the main gameplay keys, rather than an afterthought.

</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Super Spy</em> has only two missions, but both take a long time to beat. The first mission takes place in a three story building with a basement, and the second mission takes place in a 16 story skyscraper.

<ul><li> Some custom <em>Doom</em> maps can take a long time to beat.
</li><li> <em>Deus Vult</em> is a map so huge that, for the benefit of gamers with weaker computers, the author provided a version split into four separate giant maps.
</li><li> <em>Deus Vult II</em> comes to mind, with maps like "Stargate" and "Unholy Cathedral"; playing them for the first time can take over an hour.
</li><li> And then there's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doomone">DOOM:One<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which takes all four episodes of Ultimate Doom and eliminates the breaks between maps, resulting in four massive maps. If that's not enough, there's the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/57974-memorial-by-eternal/">Memorial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> map, which is essentially all 32 levels of Doom II packed into one megamap. Even if you're absolutely familiar with the maps, you'll be going at it for a while.
</li><li> Right up there is the penultimate map from Community Chest 1, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZp9cT6PDh0">The Citadel at the Edge of Eternity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The amount of time Lingyan203 spent on that map, after conquering it, should get the point across as a speedrunner's nightmare.
</li><li> The <em>Z<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood">Blood</a></em> total conversion has one such level - in the original game, "Rest for the Wicked" is a normal-sized map, while "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">The Overlooked Hotel</a>" is one of the longer ones. Here, the two are <em>combined</em> for one ultra-sized map that can take 15 minutes minimum to beat.
</li><li> Some maps from <em>Sunder</em> (renowned for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarSequence">copious fights involving tens or hundreds of monsters</a>) can take several hours to beat, and that's not including the countless dying and reloading.
</li><li> On a more modest note: <em>Eviternity</em>'s level 19, "Dehydration", is a gargantuan and complex level with a par time of 40 minutes, in a mod where most levels have par times no longer than five minutes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> has "Lazarus Labs", which is so long that it's actually split into two parts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> has a custom campaign, <em>Suicide Blitz 2</em>, which takes about twice as long as a Valve-created campaign. Even worse, you're down to three party members because one of them is carrying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">Gnome Chompsky</a> [<em>sic</em>] to the end of the campaign, where it unlocks an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>, and is thus unable to use guns. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3tk51');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3tk51" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3tk51');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Or he could put the gnome down to shoot... and have it fall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack">through the level geometry</a> and be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost for good</a>.</span> Also, the game mode Iron Man has you play a campaign without any restarts. This means you have to beat the campaign in one try and dying means everyone is booted back to the lobby. It's no longer than a standard run of the game, but no restarts can make it look like you have to keep going.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The third stage of Dustbowl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">as RED team</a> will usually take about 20 minutes to win, because the first point is very easy to take in comparison to the second. Although some maps will take longer, this stands out just for the sheer length of time spent in a single area of a single match.
</li><li> The running joke about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Hydro</a>, TF2's only Territorial Control map, is that it's always either a one-sided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> or a drawn out, back-and-forth stalemate.
</li><li> Ghost Fort, the 2012 Halloween map, has a gruesomely long time limit of 7 minutes for both teams, up from the 3 minutes that is standard for King of the Hill. Every time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetBackHereBoss">MERASMUS!</a> shows up to wreak havoc, the control point resets and must be re-capped once he is chased away. So which will end first... one round or your patience?
</li><li> The infamous Hightower and 2fort can result in this, which is totally not helped by the fact that both maps are popular. Hightower is a Payload race map that has two ramps built in, both near extremely easy chokepoints.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4ow1z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4ow1z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4ow1z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">both of which basically sit next to spawn, with the final one being vertical, so it's hard to get back on the cart once you've gotten knocked off.</span> Hightower also does not have a functional Overtime (unlike other Payload races) due to a bug, so against decently competent teams the map will grind to a screeching halt the moment both carts make it to the final ramp. 2fort is a massive grindout because the intel room is located <em>far</em> behind the spawn room, which means that anyone you kill getting to the intel is going to have <em>plenty of time</em> respawning to kick your ass when you come back out.

Notable because most other chapters focus on one small area (an office complex, a railway system, a floating alien island, et cetera). It starts with you fighting some soldiers outside of the lobby and then assaulting a fortified position on a dam, then you escape through an underwater pipe and get chased throughout the desert by a helicopter while navigating a minefield; then you flee into a drainage pipe and come out to see that you're on the side of a mountain, and you are forced to fight the soldiers camped out there, eventually acquiring a rocket launcher and taking out that annoying attack helicopter when it returns; then you go through a military-held garage, encountering more soldiers, tanks, IFVs, snipers, and more mines, until you find your way inside of a building; <em>then</em> you enter a missile facility filled with <em>tons</em> of trip-mines, being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedGameplayChange">Unexpected Gameplay Change</a> to navigating the trip-mine maze; <strong>then</strong> you come out and fight your way through a series of military-held garages and courtyards, which have more snipers and IFVs, <em><strong>then</strong></em> you fight your way through another series of courtyards where the aliens and soldiers are duking it out, with Alien Grunts and human marines shooting at each other, alien infantry clusters getting carpet bombed, Alien Grunts smashing soldiers through concrete walls, Gargantuas smashing soldiers with cars, marines getting mauled by headcrabs, artillery striking alien positions. <em>Finally</em>, after blasting through a military held building and getting outside to fight more aliens, you escape the courtyards only to be immediately pursued by a Gargantua in another garage. You eventually kill it by ordering an air strike on it and then blast a hole in the building, going through it and ending the chapter.

Then you proceed through a network of caves filled with Antlions and zombies, which involves briefly riding an old mining cart. Then you get chased by the Antlion Guardian through several caves.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> raid instances, particularly the early ones. Molten Core, the first of their kind, could maybe be cleared in two hours or so if you had a well-equipped group that was capable of cutting through the trash mobs quickly... though if your group had the gear to pull that off, they probably didn't need anything from the dungeon in the first place. Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Penny Arcade</a></em> as Time Sink Cavern.
<ul><li> Blackrock Depths also qualifies, a disorienting, non-linear underground labyrinth of a city many players visited only as required by quests for end-game content. It is the largest 5-man dungeon in the game and filled with bosses and events, but they are so widely scattered and the dungeon so confusing that getting to all of them could take upwards of four hours. As the gear was not exceptional most players only ran early parts of the dungeon and never saw the end boss when he was current content. When the dungeon finder was introduced this zone was split into three separate categories, each of which ignored several events and bosses.
</li><li> The original Sunken Temple is smaller than Blackrock Depths but makes up for it with complexity and mob density. Simply getting to the instance requires running through a mini-dungeon located within a lake. Once inside the players could face as many as <em>nineteen</em> bosses and mini-bosses scattered across five floors connected via a series of staircases rife with switchbacks and side exits. <em>Cataclysm</em> revised the instance drastically, limiting it to only the largest floor with three bosses and four mini-bosses.
</li><li> Gnomeregan is similar to Blackrock Depths in being a convoluted mess where most players used shortcuts and back doors to skip most of the instance. As the dungeon was low level and had no particularly impressive loot most players simply ignored it.
</li><li> Ulduar and Icecrown are so huge that there are teleporter pads which unlock as you progress through. There are also repair NPCs, potion vendors, and even crafting stations. Most raid instances don't have friendly NPCs in them at all, let alone this many. Even today, when you can one-hit-kill everything in these super old raids, you'd be hard pressed to finish them in less than two hours: it just takes that long to get around. <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> is also when they introduced the robot repair Jeeves, largely because trekking back to town for repairs was such a huge hassle in these enormous instances.
</li><li> Though probably the raid that takes the cake in terms of Warcraft, is Ahn Qiraj. Nowadays it's two raids, but that's an update. It takes up an entire (albeit small) zone, all on it's own. The outside part is huge, with optional bosses, minibosses and trash mobs scattered around: and then the inside part is just about as huge. To 100% complete the entire raid can still take upwards of three hours, soloing at max level. That's if you don't get lost, in which case you can spend half a day in the place easily. The trash mobs are a gauntlet, and can roam around the entire enormous instance. Which means that if you're not careful, you can actually still die in this place. If you do get lost, it can become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderofSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladderofSteel">Bladderof Steel</a>.

The current record is about 11000 floors deep, though the last major reward is on floor 500, so most people don't bother going deeper. Subverted somewhat in that you can always stop and go back to the exact same floor you just left.

<ul><li> The task force you could get from Doctor Quaterfield was twenty-four missions long, with several "defeat all enemies" missions and repetitive maps. Based on the official formula for calculating completion rewards, the median time for running it was over six hours<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note77g95');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note77g95" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note77g95');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "six hours" time was typical after seven years of increasing player skill, increasing character power, and added fast-travel options. When it was originally added to the game, completion times upwards of ten hours were common, including around two hours just spent traveling to mission locations.</span>. In order to encourage more people to play it the developers had two options: make it shorter by cutting out the redundant missions or increase the reward at the end. Guess which option they chose.
</li><li> In the single-mission department, there's the Underground Trial. An hour of slogging through subway tunnels, fighting enemies nearly non-stop, in order to face what is possibly the most difficult boss in the game. And to top it off, it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">Escort Mission</a> — whichever poor sap on your team winds up with the escort following them gets to spend most of that hour <em>not fighting</em>, in order to keep the escort safe.

<ul><li> Domain of Anguish could potentially take MUCH longer. Although it consists of four sections you could theoretically do on separate sittings, the rewards are far better when all four are done in one sitting. Each of these individual sections can take an hour or more, and some (Foundry in particular) can take several hours. Back before the last expansion, Domain of Anguish full runs could take eight to ten hours, and that isn't even including the final boss. (which thankfully you can do separately without an effect on the reward)

Overall, it's almost twice as long as most other planets, and it takes long to get from one place to another.

It has seven floors (just above the average size of a dungeon); the kicker is that two of the three bosses in there <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">do not</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretAIMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretAIMoves">play fair</a>.

If any your spells fail (even after the first of the pair dies), then you're punished with an attack that rapidly drains more health than most schools have max health, and after the first of the two dies, the second flings about an extremely powerful storm spell. The final boss calls in a minion every turn and can use a strong attack that hits all players. Even with a fairly powerful and skilled group, it can still take up to four hours to complete, and it's <em>expected</em> that teammates will die along the way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> has several, but the Underground Pass is probably the most well-known. It's a long, long trek through a deep tunnel, filled with monsters, puzzles, and traps. Years after its release, it's still considered one of the most challenging quests in the game. And if this wasn't bad enough, you have to go through it <em>again</em> at the beginning of the "Regicide" quest.
<ul><li> The TzHaar Fight Caves, which require you to fight over sixty waves of monsters. When it was first introduced, there was no way to take a break, meaning you had to sit at your computer for over an hour fighting monsters.

</li><li> The central challenge in "Elemental Workshop III" is a complex, 3D sliding puzzle that can take hours to complete...with a guide.
</li></ul></li><li> Seeing as it's built around group play, all dungeons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EdenEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EdenEternal">Eden Eternal</a></em> are marathon levels, but a special mention goes to the positively nightmarish Ulta Hall; there are several groups of enemies each with their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a>, and even taking out a pack of the easiest monsters will do enough damage to you to make you sit down and recharge HP and MP. This continues for one half of the level, and after killing Tiamat, <em>it gets worse</em>; the entrance to the centre of the maze in the dungeon has you go through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashMook">Smash Mooks</a> with HP nearly equal to that of the bosses. The thing is, though, when you fight one, <em>you fight two.</em> After this, there are enemies that materialise to attack you, and the final two bosses of the dungeon, Kenny and Gamera, are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage Sponge Bosses</a> with attacks proportionate to their HP.

Floors 1 to 100, while long, has your progress saved after every 10th floor and if your party wipes, you simply start again at the last save that was made. Floors 101 to 200 are pure marathons and while your progress is saved like usual, this is only helpful if your group needs to take a break. A party wipe at this stage ends your run right there and there are no do overs. If you want to reach floor 101 and beyond again, you have to start over from the beginning or from floor 51 and work your way back again. To even reach floor 101, you have to get to it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">without a single party wipe</a> or that run is no good and you'll have to start over. <em>Stormblood</em> adds in Heaven-On-High, which is the same thing, but going <em>up</em>.

<ul><li> Metropolis Zone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em> also counts - it has three acts instead of the usual two, and each one is quite long.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic &amp; Knuckles</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sandopolis Zone qualifies. It might not have been intentional, but the zone is still way too long, especially for Knuckles as it has a puzzle towards the end. If you can't figure it out immediately, you are going to run out of time. Very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> territory.
</li><li> Death Egg Zone Act 2 is not significantly longer than the Sandopolis stages, and after defeating the zone boss you immediately move on to the final boss, carrying whatever rings you may still have. Problem is that your time also carries over. You restart the final boss with a fresh clock if you time out, but there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">no rings</a>...
</li><li> There's also Act 2 of Carnival Night Zone, which is apparently designed to make you waste time, and get a time out while fighting Robotnik at the end. <em>Especially</em> if you get stuck at the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Barrel of Doom</a>... Knuckles's CNZ Act 2 is almost comic in comparison. It can literally take less than 70 seconds (no boss).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> has a few:
<ul><li> Sonic's version of Casinopolis counts as this because in order to reach the goal, you have to collect some <em>400</em> rings by playing the various pinball games. Unusually for this trope, it actually ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episode</a> thanks to the number of lives you'll rack up while doing this, but it will still usually take you around 15 minutes... and heaven help you if you lose all your rings and have to start over.
</li><li> Hot Shelter is this within the context of Amy's story, which is so short it can be completed in about half an hour. There are only three levels in the whole thing, but Hot Shelter is longer than the other two put together. This is because Hot Shelter is the only level that Sonic doesn't visit, so it's up to Amy to showcase the level's gimmicks instead. The problem is that most of these gimmicks involve puzzles, and when you factor in Amy's slow speed and the constant need to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">ZERO</a>, the level ends up taking about 6-7 minutes at best when her other two stages take 2-3 minutes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a>) has Cannon's Core, a single, straight-shot marathon level with a mini-level for all of the playable characters except for Shadow. After this level is a double-feature boss fight. There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine">Eternal Engine</a>, which lives up to its name and Cosmic Wall which is the longest level behind Cannon's Core, although this stage is not seriously tough compared to the other two levels mentioned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nearly every level is upward of 10-15 minutes, which is really damn long as far as Sonic games go. Special mention goes to Team Chaotix's trip through the haunted mansion, and <em>having to put out every torch in the building</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">for some reason</a> — backtracking to the beginning of the level if they miss a single one (it takes about half an hour). The fact that most levels take more than 10 minutes is especially notable because the Genesis games gives you a Time Out if you take longer than 10 minutes. It's extremely off-putting when playing the game for the first time and not realizing how long each level takes; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">the clock constantly ticking upward, with you expecting it to kill you if it reaches 10 minutes is somewhat stressful</a>, to say the least.
</li><li> Bingo Highway. If you want the emblem for level B you need to collect twenty chips. The first nineteen are tricky. but if you're not lucky enough to notice the one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> almost taped to the ceiling in a position you can only see when rotating the camera 180 degrees</span> then you can stripe a good hour of the remainder of your life.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> features Planet Wisp, which is the last level and is pretty long. It's not actually that hard, but the level design can get quite convoluted. It can take around 6-7 minutes compared to most of the levels being around 2-3 minutes.
</li><li> Most of the stages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em> but in particular the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">End of the World Stage</a> which like <em>SA2</em> features all playable characters (minus Sonic and Blaze). The stage is filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">instant kill portals and Iblis Worms</a>, in addition to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">loading screens for each segment</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation">no check points</a>, this stage will take you a long while, especially if you die.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em>, the last stage, Titanic Monarch Act 2, has four sub-areas that takes roughly two minutes each to clear. Thankfully, the ten-minute timer resets for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.
</li><li> The portable titles aren't exempt, either. In particular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance">Sonic Advance</a></em> features Egg Rocket Zone, which is long enough that it's the only level in that game that doesn't have a 10-minute timer, opting instead for a 5-minute countdown that resets at two points in the level. Having some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">fake difficult</a> enemy placements (in your path as you come off a spring, anyone?) doesn't help.

The average time of completion for a single level is approximately 2 hours, with no saving allowed in between, and <em>without</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100 Percent Completion</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a></em>, considering its fast pace in some of the levels, seemed to have quite a few levels which seemed to last for a long time, especially for those who were used to Sunsoft NES games with fairly short levels. Levels 2, 3, 4 and last level are examples of it.
</li><li> Most of the levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioMasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioMasterOfDisguise">Wario: Master of Disguise</a></em> take at least an hour to complete the first time through. Going through them again won't be nearly as long once you get all the upgrades and gained knowledge of the levels, but most of them will still be longer than your average video game level. Since there are only ten levels (not counting the 5 special episodes that reuse maps), it makes sense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ROMHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ROMHack">Redesign</a></em> has the escape sequence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">timer</a> extended from 3 minutes to 25 minutes. <em>There is a very good reason for this.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KatamariDamacy">We Love Katamari</a></em> has two. There's the 17-minute "As Large As Possible 5" level in which you create the Big Bang itself. It lasts about twice as long as any other level in the game and feels really long, which in this case is a good thing. Then, there's the Million Roses level which has you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">pick up one million roses</a>. Thankfully, you can do it over multiple sittings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidChameleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidChameleon">Kid Chameleon</a> has <em>The Final Marathon</em>, which is aptly named - an extremely long, difficult linear level where you run to the right for a long, long time. It is the penultimate level, and immediately after you beat it, you face the big boss (though, thankfully, he has his own, separate level). The game itself is in some ways an example of this trope, as it is extremely long (over 100 levels, though you are likely to go through somewhere around 2/3rds of them on any given playthrough) and there is no way to save, meaning you have to beat the ENTIRE GAME in one sitting. This is fixed in the rerelease for the PS2, where there is a save feature.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> World 8-1: Long stage + only 300 "seconds" = guaranteed chance of hearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongsInTheKeyOfPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SongsInTheKeyOfPanic">that ditty advertising that your timer is running low</a>. Additional points for being the first non-castle level in the game without the invisible checkpoints, and no indication of their lack. If you die without seeing something like the familiar stair construction, it becomes incredibly discouraged at the prospect of the stage being <em>impossibly</em> long even if you <em>were</em> actually close to the end.
</li><li> The final level is much longer than any of the equivalent levels earlier in the game. In an early case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, you also have to know how to go down a pipe in order to beat that level, even though pipes aren't in the instruction manual and are optional in every earlier level of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> The last level of World 3 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em> is one of the longest, most labyrinthic in the game (the final level is just as large, but it's justified for being indeed the last). Usually, a castle level is about to end after the player opens the locked door with a key guarded by Phanto. But here, opening that door only means 50% of the level is completed — the player's character still has to tackle three tall areas filled to the brim with enemies just to reach the castle's roof; only by that point will the game's boss music start hearing, signaling that the world's boss (Mouser) is about to be found.
</li><li> World 6 as a whole in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em>. Ten regular levels, three fortresses and the obligatory Airship level, for a total of 14. To compare, the other long worlds only have at most nine regular levels, two fortresses and the Airship each (World 7 has technically the same overall amount of levels as 6, but two of them are brief Muncher courses, so as a whole it's still shorter). Among individual levels, there's the Fortress level of World 8, a complex horizontal maze with many doors, conveyor belts, block walls that can only be overcome with P switches, and so on (it's one of the very few levels in the game with a time limit of 400 seconds, as levels are typically short enough to only require 300 at most).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>:
<ul><li> The bigger levels show up as a big dot on the map. For example, Donut Plains 2 consists of riding Skull Rafts to cross lava rivers, and since these are long, the level will invest a large part of the time available.
</li><li> The very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> Special World is worth mentioning. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Tubular, Way Cool and Outrageous</a> especially. But they pale in comparison to the very last level of the special world: Funky. How long is it? Know how the 2D Mario games have time limits on the levels? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">There's not enough time to beat this level.</a> The only way to beat it is if you're very skilled with the cape... or if you brought (or found in the level) Yoshi, as the green berries (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">with no indication, and which appear nowhere else in the game</a>) increase the time limit. The level design is quite clever however, and if you manage to brave all that, the very last part is filled with nothing but coins that you won't collect and will rather run under so you can reach the end on time. And all the better for it, as it spells out YOU ARE A SUPER PLAYER! After this level, you can pat yourself on the back for a job well done.
</li></ul></li><li> "The Sinking Lava Spire", the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalLavaLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalLavaLand">Melty Molten Galaxy</a> mission of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">And later you have to do it again untouched</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>.

Numerous traps and hazards must be sorted to get the main star. So many that, for those wanting to hurry to beat the game, it's easier to proceed to the next galaxy by <em>getting the hidden star</em>.
</li><li> This is a large part of the difficulty behind Darker Side of the Moon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em>. It's 14 sections without checkpoints, with many being about the length of a full Power Moon mission elsewhere in the game.
</li><li> SMWCentral's 9th Door Contest had this as a surprisingly common feature. Since they were supposed to be comparable to the 8 doors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>'s final level, the ones that were marathon-length were docked points.

</div></li><li> Contests have this in spades, regardless of the game. The 2010 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> Chocolate Level Contest had Logup's level, which took some poor guy nearly FORTY MINUTES to complete because of how ridiculously long it was. And that's only because the boss didn't work. Here's a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILQSanm6tOE">video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

X Thing</a></em> was brutal enough that the game circumvented the usual limit on checkpoints by putting in obscure, essentially invisible warps to later parts of the stage that would be revealed once you'd reached those points the long way. Such "knowledge checkpoints" have since become a staple of level design in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioMaker2">Super Mario Maker 2</a></em>
</li><li> Bowser's Castle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario">Brutal Mario</a></em> is one of these too, with at least twenty seperate areas and about 10 bosses in total.

To finish the level, Luigi has to press the four switches and activate the switch block bridge. However, each switch is behind an obstacle-filled path. The stage is so long, it counts as two exits.
</li><li> Long levels are frequent in <em>Super Mario World</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">ROMhacks</a>.

Particularly infamous for this is Super Mario Infinity's level <em>Dark Depths,</em> a cave level that essentially takes you to hell. It's been said to be worth an entire <em>world</em> of Super Mario Infinity levels. The individual levels <em>before</em> Dark Depths are thought to be worth a world of the original game each.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Impossible</a> difficulty, which is exactly the same as Hard (and, for that matter, all the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyLevels">Difficulty Levels</a>) but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation">removes all save points</a>, making the entire game into one extremely long Marathon Level.

While it's only somewhat more lengthy than other levels, it's extremely <em>chaotic,</em> and the later half of it is basically an endless stream of combat. And there's constant running back and forth between several places you need to be on a strict time limit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIIDraculasCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaIIIDraculasCurse">Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse</a></em> has the mountain range block (one of the two possible entry level castle areas, the one you have if you take the Alucard-optional route), which consists of SEVEN stages containing FOUR bosses. Even if you make generous use of Alucard's ability to bypass entire long sections of the block as a bat, you're still in for quite a long and grueling ride.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaTheAdventureRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaTheAdventureRebirth">Castlevania The Adventure Rebirth</a></em> has Stage 5, the last major stage in the game, as Stage 6 is essentially just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> battle. It's the typical Castlevania <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockTower">Clock Tower</a> level for the most part, but has a lot of extra elements, such as a couple of halls filled with clocks, a few rooms with floating pendulums in the sky, a lift in a tower, and a sub-boss (all the stages have a sub-boss, but it still adds to the length).
</li><li> Click Clock Wood from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em> (literally four times bigger than any other level, due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourSeasonsLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourSeasonsLevel">season-changing concept</a>), and the second half of <em>Banjo-Tooie</em> (with levels that approach the gargantuan scope of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> levels, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prehistoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prehistoria">Terrydactyland</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine">Grunty Industries</a>).
</li><li> Ultimate Mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMonkeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMonkeyBall">Super Monkey Ball</a> Deluxe</em>, where you have to go through all of the Beginner, Advance, and Expert stages in one sitting. You are able to save, but it possibly won't help that much. Also, this is the only way to unlock the Master stages. Good luck on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ThatOneLevel/SuperMonkeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ThatOneLevel/SuperMonkeyBall">Exam-C!</a> Then there's Expert in general. It's 50 levels long and houses a grand majority of Monkey Ball's most infamous stages, including the aforementioned Exam-C. Bear in mind that Expert in <em>Deluxe</em> is comprised of <em>two Expert courses</em>.
</li><li> Any of the final levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario">Brutal Mario</a></em>. The Mega Man styled level is a key example, it's actually three separate stages accessed by the same overworld tile, the first of which is a Marathon Level in its own right. Other key examples include Bowser's Castle (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lFsIROYbxk&amp;feature=related">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is just part 1 of about 9 sections...) Practically, most of the later levels are designed like this because the same custom sprite is used to generate 90% of the enemies in each level, and merely acts differently based on level and screen number...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoemonsGreatAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoemonsGreatAdventure">Goemons Great Adventure</a></em> has the 5 castles. Each one of them is much longer than the average level and can easily take 20-30 minutes to just get through - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">if you're good at this.</a> The last one, Floating castle, is <em>even longer</em>, being made from 4 parts, each having 2 long, difficult platforming sections.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DistortedTravesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DistortedTravesty">Distorted Travesty</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Veiled Detritus" from the original game is the only level to actually have a map screen, due to how enormous it is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a> "Secured Data Segment" also goes on and on and on... luckily it provides a teleporter room partway through so you can leave and pick up where you left off.
</li><li> The second game has the final level: "the Bug". It is seriously almost as long as <em>the entire rest of the game combined</em> (although, given that the game is rather short, this isn't as bad as it sounds). Fortunately there are save points every few rooms.
</li></ul></li><li> The Airport (Level 4) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NES" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NES">NES</a>) is one big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaze">maze</a> of tunnels and high-rise buildings separated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurmountableWaistHighFence">Insurmountable Waist High Fences</a>, all of which are brutal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell">Platform Hell</a> exercises that give you the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">first real taste</a> of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">utterly soul-smashing difficulty</a>. Expect to perform a lot of painful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backtracking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backtracking">backtracking</a>, and possibly sidetracking as well should you lose one of your Turtles (which is a <em>very</em> likely event). <br/><br/>Area 5, the Foot Clan Fort, can also be this, as the pathway to the level-end boss is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">randomly chosen</a>. This means that it could be under either the first manhole you choose, or the very last one. If you're unlucky, expect the level to become exponentially longer and more grueling as you'll have to constantly backtrack to restock your weapons in order to deal with all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> that have replaced the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">Goddamned Bats</a> of previous levels. And if you lose a Turtle, expect that exponentiality to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadtoWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadtoWorse">increase by leaps and bounds</a>, as the dungeon that contains your captured Turtle is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisisGonnaSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisisGonnaSuck">also</a></em> randomly generated.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisneyPrincessEnchantedJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisneyPrincessEnchantedJourney">Disney Princess: Enchanted Journey</a></em>, Snow White's chapters are very long, as are Cinderella's.
</li><li> Lots and lots and lots of levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushroomKingdomFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushroomKingdomFusion">Mushroom Kingdom Fusion</a></em>. Some examples:
<ul><li> All final levels in a world, since by definition they're designed to be longer than the others to provide a decent challenge. Hell Prominence (aka Bowser's Castle) in world 1 is a good example.
</li><li> Toyland in general. This <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfIllusion">Castle of Illusion</a></em>-style level is way, way longer than it probably should be, since it seems to be designed to recreate an entire world from the source game in a single stage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil">Raccoon City</a>. The fact it has hordes of constantly reviving undead does not help at all.
</li><li> The final levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMUFODefense">X-COM</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMTerrorFromTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMTerrorFromTheDeep">TFTD</a>. It's a bit confusing too.
</li><li> The Library level, based on the same infamous stage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>. It's at least as long as the one in the original game, which is a Marathon Level by itself. It's also not finished, apparently the final version will have a boss fight based on one of the game's bosses stuck at the end of it. And as world 9's 'world boss' level, you can probably guess how hard it is...
</li></ul></li><li> The Bowhemoth Challenge mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runbow">Runbow</a></em>. The game itself even tells you that your progress will not be saved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996">Crash Bandicoot (1996)</a></em> has Sunset Vista. It is probably the longest level in the original trilogy. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootNSaneTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicootNSaneTrilogy">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a></em>, which added time trials to all the levels in the first game, has a <em>five minute</em> time for the Sapphire relic in a game where most Sapphire times average 1-2 minutes, sometimes 3 for other very long levels. Another example is Stormy Ascent, which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">not made available in the initial release</a> and is even more intimidating in this regard. The <em>N. Sane Trilogy</em> officially added the level as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> and its Sapphire time is <em>7 minutes</em>. The Gold relic time is the longest by a huge margin as well, at 4:30, and the Platinum is not much shorter.
</li><li> Most of levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashBandicootTheWrathOfCortex">Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex</a></em> are considerably longer with higher box tools than in previous games, but Gold Rush, level 22, definitely takes the cake, having five checkpoints and 209 boxes.
</li><li> High Seas Hi-Jinks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashTwinsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CrashTwinsanity">Crash Twinsanity</a></em>. Features a lengthy platforming sequence, a boss battle, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew">chasing sequence</a> and <em>another</em> boss battle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Pandemonium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Pandemonium">Pandemonium!</a> 2</em> has the final non-boss level, The Bitter End, which takes at least half an hour to complete (it's a mostly vertical maze full of backtracking through areas that get progressively harder, a sequence with rocket powered jumps, a chase sequence, and a miniboss), <em>much</em> more than basically any other level in the game.
</li><li> The stages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomPlanet">Freedom Planet</a></em> are already on the long side, but Battle Glacier stands out as especially long. Each stage has an in-game challenge to clear it in a certain time. Most stages give you 5 to 7 minutes. Battle Glacier's is 12 minutes, and that can only be done if you've mastered the stage, know its fastest routes, and know what you can skip. Going through it blind can easily take about an hour.
</li><li> Stage 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketKnightAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RocketKnightAdventures">Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2</a></em> is made up of three different sections, two mini-bosses, and one main boss.
</li><li> The Windmill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AHatInTime">A Hat in Time</a></em> is one of the hardest acts in the game, as it's a long, linear climb with many difficult jumping and parkour sections. There are several checkpoints with healing hearts scattered about, and you'll likely need every one you can grab.
</li><li> These occassionally appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em>:
<ul><li> The final planet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClank2002">Ratchet &amp; Clank (2002)</a></em>. True, it is about the size of a standard planet. However, most of other planets have a central hub with split paths that you can clear one at a time, while this planet is one long-winded road to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. To make matters worse it is filled to the brom with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> with quite a few dropships and tanks with huge range mixed in, and you most likely don't have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">R.Y.N.O.</a>, so you have to clear them slowly out with Visibomb Gun or Devastator.
</li><li> Umbris and Gemlik's Base, for the same reason as above. Umbris isn't as annoying because it is essentially an obstacle course with few enemies, but evading indestructible machine guns and searching for timed buttons to open the doors will take some time, especially since all of this must be done at one moment in a maze. And end is essentially long Hydrodisplacer puzzle. Gemlik's base is on the other hand on par with Veldin because you have to destroy those beacon towers to advance, there are jet-fighters that like to bombard you, guards behind indestructible shields that shoot at you and you must dodge omnipresent exploding barrels on your long, long path to the end.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</a></em> have Gladiator Arena Challenges. While there are some challenges explicitly called Endurance Run and such that have 10-20 rounds which already qualify for this trope, there is an ultimate challenge for each game that <em>really</em> takes the cake. In second game the aptly named Impossible Challenge does not even show the number of rounds (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's 60</span>) and ends in a battle with Megapede who itself takes quite a time to take down, though if you have Bouncer the entire challenge is rather easy given its power, ammo clip and amount of ammo dropped per crate. In the third game the Qwarktastic Challenge has <strong>100</strong> rounds, the 50th and 100th round are boss fights, and on top of that some rounds include special conditions, which can go really nasty for timed rounds where you fail instantly when time runs out.

<ul><li> Several levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChipsChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChipsChallenge">Chip's Challenge</a></em> can take a long time to complete, such as On The Rocks (level 33), Rink (61), Cityblock (87), Mix Up (132), Pain (134) and Cake Walk (146). And the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel">Fan Sequels</a> have even longer (and more devious) levels.
</li><li> <em>Puzzle Gallery: At the Carnival</em> has the Grease Burger attraction. Solving a 3x3 word square may be difficult, but this puzzle set gives <em>twenty seven</em> of them in a row.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster">Tetris: The Grand Master</a> ACE</em> has the Another Road, a set of missions that can take over 15 minutes to clear.

Baskerville is probably the most annoying in this regard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyRoomsOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyRoomsOfDeath">Deadly Rooms of Death</a></em> had <a class="urllink" href="http://forum.caravelgames.com/viewtopic.php?TopicID=1678">a contest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where the goal was to make the longest single room possible.

The Hell Gate bonus level is 100 floors long, each floor containing a full campaign battle (more than the rest of the game combined), without the free HP refills and saves you'd get between normal battles. Every floor contains some of the deadliest enemies in the game, many of which have petrify (gorgons in particular, can petrify numerous party members at any distance in one move!). In the PSX remake, you can save in battle and thus break this up into segments, and redo a level if you screwed up big time, but in the Super Famicom original, it's a 10+ hour mission, no saves, no free heals, and the game featured permanent death if you didn't resurrect the player before the end of the battle (meaning before you kill everything on the floor). Both of your rezzers petrified/dead? You lose, even if you were on level 99 and spent the entire day on this. Now that's a wonderful failure. Finishing this dungeon was not only harder than the final dungeon, the gear obtained totally trivialized any other content, even if you didn't abuse the infinite stat spell. In the original version, possibly qualifies as the longest marathon level in any console game.

All previous caves have at most nine levels (basement floors), and frequently only five or seven. The ones in Wistful Wild are <em>10 to 15</em> floors long, and several of them take long to tackle due to the heavier concentration of enemies and hazards. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Hole of Heroes adds multiple bosses, too</a>.

For scale, the 10-planet learn-as-you-play tutorial can take 2-4 hours, and that's heavily scripted to accurately reflect a normal game (such a small galaxy ordinarily gives the AI an insurmountable advantage).

<ul><li> Some Oni courses on PS2 versions, such as Hardcore in <em>DDRMAX</em>, are up to 20 songs long, which is a total of about 30 minutes.
</li><li> When it comes to single songs, no one song wears one out faster then "Love is Dreamless" by L.E.D.; even though it's not that much longer then the average DDR song (almost 2 minutes compared to 90 or 100 seconds), on Hard or Oni Mode, you're just BEGGING for it to be over by the last 30 seconds!
</li><li> The arcade version of <em>DDRMAX2</em> also had the Oni Road course, which was the longest course ever in an arcade DDR, made up of 10 of the hardest songs in the game at the time and ending with Maxx Unlimited. It was over 15 minutes long and contained 3,783 steps (if you count jumps as one step). And it was playable on a single credit, which was probably why it was removed from later versions.

<ul><li> <em>Rhythm Heaven</em>, the one for the DS, has Fillbots 2. Not quite as extreme as the other examples on this list, clocking in at only a little over 4 minutes, but it is quite a contrast to the rest of the series, with songs mostly around the 60- to 90-second range and is the only stage in the entire series longer than its corresponding game's Final Remix stage.

Good luck. And if you're seeking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, it only gets even more sadistic, because the boss has three drops, with only one being common.

Thankfully, most players won't ever have to do anything in it beyond grind at low levels or look for spellbooks. It's only important for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ultra Endings.</span> Players will need to kill Filk the Ratling Bard, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who is on a dungeon level decided by what the player's first kill was, multiplied by how many times the player has killed that monster.

</li><li> The ultimate goal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzureDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzureDreams">Azure Dreams</a></em> is to reach the 40th floor of the monster tower. Since it's magical, the tower always sends you back to the 1st floor when leaving it, forcing you to do it in one go, entering and leaving the tower before a lot to train your familiars and collect items so you can actually best the higher floors' monsters.

Getting the abyssal rune requires wandering around for thousands of turns since its likelihood of spawning increases the longer you're there, and getting all the runes in Pandemonium requires you to be ready for any of four different special levels with endgame bosses at any time. Needless to say, starvation is a serious concern, especially if you're sent to the Abyss unexpectedly!

<ul><li> The Pit of 100 Trials, much like its predecessor, is a lengthy 100-floor gauntlet filled with increasingly tough foes. However, this game ups the ante by including <em>two</em> Pits: first there's the Flipside Pit of 100 Trials, populated by normal enemies; beating its boss unlocks the Flopside Pit of 100 Trials, which is filled with exceptionally powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow">Dark enemies</a>. Even worse, once you reach the end of that one, the boss essentially says "I'm impressed, come back again and we'll fight", forcing you to clear the Flopside Pit a second time for a total of <em>300 levels</em> before full completion.
</li><li> There's also Sammer's Kingdom — after it's restored in the postgame, you can take on the full Duel of 100, which consists of a hundred battles in succession.

You have to land the Big Whale on a small spot above a ramp on the Moon, go through three different caves before you reach the Moon Castle, then enter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> by stepping on a panel in the crystal room.

But then, near the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaLevel">Nostalgia Level</a> portion, you go through three two-to-three floor areas based on the Elemental Archfiends you haven't faced yet. At thee end of that, at about Basement 16 of the Subterrane, you have a climactic battle with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Dark Knight</span>. Your reward for beating that? You get to continue on and enter the <em>Depths</em>. There are roughly <em>twenty-odd floors</em> to the Depths, with four <em>mandatory</em> boss fights every five floors or so. And it just gets harder and harder and <em>harder</em> as you descend. The True Moon is, without hyperbole, longer than the other chapters of the game <em>combined</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>
<ul><li> The Mage's Tower. It's optional, but it's a very long climb to the top of nothing but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteEnvironments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutAndPasteEnvironments">the same environment over and over again of walking up stairs</a>, with only a few chest rooms to break it up. On top of that, you can only use magic in this dungeon, so the inability to restore your MP until close to the end is pretty rough. There's only one save point, and the boss at the top is a textbook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss">Barrier Change Boss</a> that takes a while to defeat. And once you beat the boss, you still have to walk all the way back down unless you've got enough magic left to use the Warp spell.
</li><li> Kefka's Tower. It takes three parties to jump in, and while you can perform it any time after you get the Airship in the World of Ruin, it's pretty tough going even if you've completed everything else. Each party has a long trek down to one of three switches, including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a> in one of the Three Statues on each route, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation">Check-Point Starvation</a> since there's few opportunities to save. It can easily take more than an hour to reach a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SavePoint">Save Point</a> in this dungeon, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> has multiple form to go through as well.
</li><li> There are three scenarios after the first battle with Ultros. While you have to complete all three, Sabin's is easily the longest. It requires a trek through the Imperial Base, meeting up with Cyan, and fighting through to the Phantom Forest, coupled with the Phantom Train immediately following it. And once that's done, you still have to go to the Veldt, find out the right way to recruit Gau, and then complete the Serpent's Trench, then finally hitch a ride on a ship at Nikeah to bring you to South Figaro. All of this is interspersed with long cutscenes, two sequences of walking through Doma Castle as Cyan without fighting, and several other plot developments. The player can recruit Shadow at the beginning, but he might randomly leave at the end of any battle, forcing rapid-fire saving just to ensure the player keeps him up until the Veldt (when he leaves automatically). While Sabin's route isn't necessarily the hardest of the three, it's still so intensely long and full of plot developments that it's typically recommended that a player save it for last. In any other part of the game, this disparate sequence of events wouldn't be that remarkable because it's more of a chain of multiple short to medium length separate plots. However, since it's framed as 1/3 of the different character paths but takes longer than the other two put together, it really feels like an eternity.

<ul><li> While not exactly a level, the original game features a <em>really</em> long boring sequence of staircases if player choses to follow Tifa's plan during the raid on Shinra Headquarters and sneaks in from behind. You get somewhat rewarded halfway though, finding an Elixir, but still you get to the top of every screen thinking it's going to be the last one. <em>And it never is.</em> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">remake</a> underscores the fatigue further by slowing the characters' walking speed and making the music more discordant the further up you go.
</li><li> The snow section. The first section is a featureless plain where you have to use manually-placed markers just to avoid getting lost, all while trying to navigate to the right area. The second section is a huge ice cliff, where you have to keep your party's body temperature up by repeatedly pressing a button, lest everyone freeze to death. It's not that intrusive as it goes away whenever you enter a cavern, but it still slows your progress down to a crawl when you're outside. On top of that, the whole place is a maze, and it's very easy to get lost. At least there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingCheckpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingCheckpoint">Healing Checkpoint</a> if you feel like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>, but it's so late in the dungeon that you'll probably just want to get it over with.
</li></ul></li><li> The Pharos Lighthouse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>. Contains 100 floors, and you actually do have to climb almost all of them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Azure Sky Tower starts out 12 floors tall, and adds 3 more every time you complete it. It may not seem big at first, but there's a reward for getting it up to 99, and you have to start from floor 1 every time you try, and it's even worse if you got all the Emblems, since you need to fight a difficult boss at the end. Depending on your luck, individual floors can take anywhere from a minute (where the key and door are right nearby) to much longer (if you accidentally miss the damn Undead hiding the key while making your sweep, for example).
</li><li> Dream Avenue in the second one works similarly (though thank the gods, the number of floors are fixed). This one depends on enemy layout however - since you'll want <em>them</em> to trip the switches that may drop the key, or <em>nuke anything around it</em>.
</li><li> Vambery in <em>Lunar Knights</em> too, but you can do it in 10-floor segments. No hunting here - just kill everything in a small section, and you move on. Problem is that the all enemies have their levels scaled to match your current floor.
</li><li> All three require you to finish the entire section before you can save - die or use a Fool Card/Escape, and the whole thing doesn't count. Souped-up bosses also appear at the end of both Dream Avenue and Vambery, up to the last miniboss in Dream Avenue, up to a L99 version of the <em>final boss</em> in Vambery.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcTheLad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcTheLad">Arc the Lad</a></em> had a 50 floor long bonus dungeon. It didn't let you save. The dungeon returned in the sequel with additional floors if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">converting the save file</a> from the first game.
</li><li> Seeing how you can play through most levels and subquests of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VampireTheMasqueradeBloodlines"> Vampire: The Masquerade  Bloodlines</a></em> in under 15 minutes, the Nosferatu Warrens are VERY long by comparison, as you can spend several hours finding your way through them. Luckily, the levels have two emergency exits (the only instance of such in the entire game) for you to replenish spent ammo etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondOasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondOasis">Beyond Oasis</a></em> has a hidden 100-floor dungeon. It's worth it for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Infinity +1 Sword</a> at the bottom, but wow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Obelisk</a> (145 floors) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Tower of Kagutsuchi</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast">666</a> floors). Although they both have elevators that'll take you past a good majority of those floors, it's certainly going to <em>feel</em> like you're walking up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllUpstairsFromHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllUpstairsFromHere">each and every one</a> yourself. Also, as if to emphasise its sheer length, while the Tower has three large Terminals, the Obelisk only has S-terminals, which means if you have to go back down for whatever reason, you have to start the entire dungeon <em>all over again</em>. And it's not like they're not filled with incredibly annoying puzzles, extremely difficult bosses, powerful Mooks and a ludicrously high random encounter rate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse">Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse</a></em> already beefs up several preexisting dungeons (most notably the two Tsukiji Hongwanji dungeons) from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIV">its predecessor</a> and adds a six-floor dungeon to the Neutral routes, but most notorious is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">YHVH's Universe</span>, the final dungeon on those routes. Despite having only four floors, each of those floors is obnoxoiously big, with massive islands to run across and as many as <em>eighteen</em> labeled sub-areas on each floor, all connected by teleport doors and cubes, some of which require finding certain locations to unlock, some others of which serve as shortcuts but require that one of your stats be high enough, and some of which are one-way doors designed to screw you over. Even with the DLC that lifts the level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">cap</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant">Estoma to make enemy encounters go away</a> (as you will likely have a party in the 90's or even 100's level range at this point), you will still likely get lost and spend hours just trying to find the way to the next floor if you don't consult a map. Flynn even advises you to zoom out the map so you don't get lost there. Its few saving graces: This is a game where you can save anywhere and get revived from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> at no cost, and there are warp points you can activate so you can jump to ones you've visited already.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga">Digital Devil Saga</a></em> ups the ante with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>, the Karma Temple. It's three times the size of any other dungeon, filled with the toughest encounters in the game and multiple mid-bosses, and features confusing mazes filled with false walls, invisible teleportation circles and damage floors. Also, it has very few save points and only two healing stations: one at the start and one at the two-thirds point.
</li><li> Finding Arawn to cure Samson's curse in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondTheBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BeyondTheBeyond">Beyond the Beyond</a></em> qualifies for this. After completing a number of side quests you fight your way through the Gaea Shrine, which is like one big puzzle in it of itself. Then you climb a giant monster-infested Magic Vine in order to reach Arawn's Tower. Then you have to fight through the Tower and its puzzles to <em>finally</em> meet Arawn. Considering this game's <em>only</em> save point is at churches, you better prepare for a long play-through and have your characters appropriately leveled and stocked.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> series has a number of these:
<ul><li> The biggest offenders are the Elemental Rocks in the second game. Air's Rock in particular has two parts, each of which being a longer-than-average dungeon in and of itself. It requires the use of a Psynergy that's fairly expensive for utility Psynergy, and which requires unequipping all Djinn unless you're playing with single-element classes. You're also supposed to go there with only three party members; it's possible to get the fourth before completing it, but that requires fighting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a> significantly underleveled. The area's one saving grace is that it has a very low random encounter rate. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Dark Dawn</a></em> has a few as well, with Belinsk Ruins being the longest.
</li><li> Otka Island in the third game. Too many rooms to count. You can get through the dungeon in a reasonable time for a dungeon if you use a guide, and a little longer to get all the items as well. Not playing with a guide? Too bad. Unlike everything else, there's no map. And to make matters worse, all the rooms look the same. Yes, it is very easy to get lost. Thankfully, the dungeon is designed for someone who knows how to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">navigate labyrinths</a> (specifically, by using the "left hand rule", touch the wall to the left and walk along it, only going where the wall leads you). You can get all the items and the summon this way, however, it will lead to going through a LOT of unnecessary rooms and if it weren't for happening upon the items, an impatient person will wonder if they aren't going around in circles with this method.
</li></ul></li><li> At least half the dungeons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AvalonCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AvalonCode">Avalon Code</a></em>. When you're only 15 hours in and the dungeon consists of over 25 screens, each with their own mini-puzzle and monster battles, you know you've got a long haul ahead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs3">Wild ARMs 3</a></em> contains The Abyss, a hundred level dungeon with every encounter being an ambush with out a certain skill on all the characters. It also contains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Ragu Ragula</a>,one of the hardest bosses in the game.
</li><li> The Eternal Tower in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarZero">Phantasy Star Zero</a></em> certainly lives up to its name. It's 101 floors long and while each one is short it eventually adds up. There's no saving so you can't turn off your DS during this. You can't use telepipes and can only return to town after beating a boss after every 10 floors. If you want the full rewards you have to beat it a total of three times, once for each difficulty. And you HAVE to beat it on Hard if you want to play on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Super difficulty</a> offline, once for each character you have. Thank God for the DS' Sleep Mode function...
</li><li> Missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em> can get really, really long at times, not counting the time you spend fighting the ridiculously healthy enemies. Cetra forbid you die to the mission-ending encounter. Here's a great idea: have the players fight 1000 elite Shinra troops meted out into consecutive groups of 9 and 1! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">It makes one dubious of the ending.</a>
</li><li> The last dungeon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate">Exit Fate</a></em> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vanaheim</span>) contains <em>three</em> bosses before you get to the final boss, and the paths between them are fairly long; in a game where most areas have two or three save points, this one has <em>five</em>.
</li><li> The Sky Museum level from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em>, has this combined with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">time limit</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> has Tartarus, a tower that the party's school turns into during the Dark Hour. It has a total of 256 Floors, although floors are only unlocked as you progress through the game, and the minibosses located here are much tougher than the Full Moon bosses. The thing is that, despite the tower actually being plot-mandated to be climbed eventually, it is the location for grinding most of the time, so the player is likely to go through the tower in chunks here and there. And save for the Full Moon operation at January 31, all of them will not allow you to save the game, will not allow you to use the Velvet Room and you must defeat the Full Moon boss to go any further. If you die anywhere in the operation, the last save point is at the day prior.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> features this in droves at the end of the story. The last job for the Phantom Thieves occurs on 12/24, and it has to be done all in one day. There's a few ways to mitigate the worst of it, but it's still going to be one hell of a trek.
<ul><li> Mementos, the side dungeon that was playable alongside the story dungeons for the whole game. This location has a total of 66 descending floors of cursed subway tunnels. If you've taken care of the Mementos quests, you'll have likely traversed to the lower floors, and can skip straight to the bottom. If you ignored Mementos... Have fun going down all 66 floors at once, all without healing.
</li><li> Mementos Depth, aka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prison of Sloth</span>, the location behind the final barrier in Mementos. This is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a>... sort of. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Futaba</a> will say that the entrance to Mementos Depths can only be opened from the outside, so going inside means the party will be stuck until things are completed. But the game is generous enough to give the player a healing NPC at the entrance, and there is the option to leave the dungeon and go to the clinic and Airsoft to buy healing items and equipment.
</li><li> Quliphoth City, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefiniteFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefiniteFinalDungeon">Very Definite Final Dungeon</a> of the game. It occurs <em>immediately</em> after finishing up the Mementhos Depths, and after <em>a lot</em> of cutscenes — including the option to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding">Bad Ending</a> — and leaving the player already drained of dungeons at the beginning. The enemies here are pretty tough, with several Shadows wrapped in red auras, and capable of killing your party or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCannotGoOnWithoutYou">Joker</a> if one isn't careful. There are four minibosses to fight on each level before the player finally manages to get to the area of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. Once again, the game is kind enough to have a healing NPC at the beginning of the dungeon, but the player cannot jump back to the beginning until they reach the end. If one wants to get healing midway through the dungeon without wasting items, have fun going all the way back. And this place doesn't allow access to the clinic or Airsoft anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a> II</em> has Watcher's Keep: Not that many floors, but when these floors include a teleporting maze, a dozen different puzzles, some of the toughest monsters in the game (including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> of the un-expansion game encountered just by randomly entering a room) it literally takes about as much time as the rest of the expansion content. Luckily you can save the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> doesn't exactly have short levels to begin with, but there are some that really outstay their welcome:
<ul><li> Completing Orzammar in its entirety is twice as long and twice as hard as anything else in the game, involving a huge amount of time spent running around both city and subterranean roads, encountering hordes of enemies and sidequests, several bosses (often lumped in quick succession), and a freaking tournament. It is exhausting.
</li><li> While not as mind-bogglingly <em>gigantic</em> as Orzammar, the Circle Tower deserves a mention. It would be a typical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> level if it weren't for the fact that in the middle you suddenly get sent into the Fade and <em>separated from your party</em>, requiring you to first track down multiple Fade forms to shapeshift into, a process which in and of itself requires you to enter every part of the Fade about seventeen different times, and find all your party. When that's done you get to go back to the Circle Tower and complete the level. Oh, and once you enter the Tower, you have to do the <em>whole thing</em> without returning to camp for supplies or to switch out party members, something even Orzammar lets you do.
</li><li> What probably takes up nearly as much time as Orzammar is <em>Arl of Redcliffe</em>, which takes you through an undead siege at Redcliffe, a slog through the demon infested Redcliffe Castle, then to the Tower (if you don't want to either kill Connor or Isolde to get shot of the demon possessing the kid), then a segment through the Fade again, potentially right after you slogged through the Towers Lost In Dreams. After that, you then learn <em>why</em> the whole debacle happened, Arl Eamon got poisoned by (possibly your former best friend) Jowan, a blood mage. To cure him, you need to find the Urn of Sacred Ashes, which has been lost for (literal) ages. Tracking it down requires you to go into Denerim to find a scholar, who isnt there, and his assistant was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">killed and replaced</a>. That leads you to Haven, a village up in the mountains, home to a religious cult. Then you have to get through an abandoned temple, filled with zealots, traps, and dragons. Then you have to fight a goddamned High Dragon to get into the temple itself, then through its challenges, which involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorBoss">Mirror Boss</a>, and a logic puzzle. After that you return to Redcliffe and finally finish doing stuff for the quest (Arl of Redcliffe technically doesnt end until Eamon calls the Landsmeet, ostensibly the games second act.). All of that is an hours-long trial. But there is good loot along the way, at least.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> doesn't have very many main quests to start out with, so most of the missions are slightly longer than usual. However, Noveria makes up the bulk of the game. You must manage to find a way into a garage after breaking into a back office and finding computer evidence. Then, you must drive your vehicle all the way to a ruin site, repair a broken computer terminal, then use that in order to take a train to a human colony. You must then find some health supplies for an infection that has broken out, and THEN you finally fight Matriarch Benezia, the boss. And not only that, there's loads of geth and rachni that you must fight along the way. Oh, and there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation">barely any checkpoints.</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Demon Shaft</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud">Dark Cloud</a></em> is 100 floors long, and each floor has a random layout. Thankfully, you can leave the dungeon, and come back to the last floor you were on at a later point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em> has a quest called <em>Explorers Guild Trial</em>. It involves spending five days of game time on level B8F. This can take three hours, and the only thing that makes it beatable is the spring nearby that heals all health and mana. It returns in the remake, with Story Mode alleviating the process with events that can skip 8 hours of each day. Of course, there's nothing stopping you from strolling back and forth in the encounter-free spring room, but that's still tedious.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>, roughly halfway through the main quest, you'll need to visit Kogoruhn, the ancient stronghold of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">Great House</a> Dagoth (of which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Dagoth Ur was the leader). You are tasked with finding three specific items in order to pass "The Warrior's Test" to be named Urshilaku Nerevarine. Two of the items are easily found in the domes on the roof. The third requires a trek through the multi-level dungeon and the extensive underground tunnels beneath, which are crawling with Dagoth Ur's Ash Creature minions, undead (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">stat-damaging</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Greater Bonewalkers</a>), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">lesser Daedra</a>. Even if you are able to complete it in one shot without having to backtrack to civilization to heal and restock, expect to spend at least an hour there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Any time you go into an Oblivion Gate. You have to go around and find a way to get to the main tower where the Sigil Stone is before you can get inside, then you have to fight your way up (which can take hours since your enemies level up with you) and then take the stone.
</li><li> The final leg of the Thieves Guild "The Ultimate Heist" quest is basically two lengthy dungeon crawls slapped together, except the first in an actual dungeon and the second is sneaking your way through the Imperial Palace. And on top of that, halfway through the quest you have to fire a specific arrow of which you only have one of (it's recommended you save prior to firing it), and if miss you are screwed and need to start the whole quest over again.
</li></ul></li><li> The Forgotten Vale quest of the <em>Dawnguard</em> DLC to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>. The region you must work through is easily one third the size of the original game map. The fact that there is gratuitous amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a> there helps, however.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteUndiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfiniteUndiscovery">Infinite Undiscovery</a></em> has the bonus dungeon, the Seraphic Gate. While it's only 17 floors deep, and most of the floors aren't particularly huge, the enemies are all very powerful, and simply running from them all is a good way to get your party members killed (you must sheath your weapons to run). The floors that ARE big are very big, some of which take over 5 minutes to run through without fighting anything. There's only one save point (halfway down and just past a difficult bonus boss), one teleporter back to the surface (in the save room, also meaning there's no easy way out if you're simply farming for experience or item drops), and the super powerful boss of the dungeon, Ethereal Queen, can only be fought if you first beat another difficult boss immediately before her. And the dungeon's longest and most dangerous floors are AFTER the save point, meaning if you lose to Queenie, you've got another long slog ahead of you. The worst part? If you want full gamerscore, you have to kill her on Hard and Infinity mode, both of which can't be unlocked until you beat the game on the difficulty before it, meaning you have to beat the game 3 times (the Gate only opens up when you beat the game and load your save).

Not even those Sentry Bots can save you; the most the sentry bots will do is thin the herd of weak feral ghouls will the Reavers eat their bullets like popcorn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitosOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatenKaitosOrigins">Baten Kaitos Origins</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EternalEngine">Tarazed</a>. It's composed of four different 'blocks' that you have to traverse to shut down the power generators. Each block is a maze, full of loot, one-way paths, and dead ends, and <em>every room looks the same</em>. When you finally find the generator room, you have to solve a smaller maze puzzle to actually enter the room and shut it down. Even worse, the place teems with Machina Auto-Turrets, high-order <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> that can effortlessly wipe away an hour or two's worth of progress. You'll want to save every chance you can, except the closest save point is rather inconveniently located, forcing you to run all the way out of Tarazed every time you complete a block. Did you get the impression that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">That One Level</a>?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> has Terra Tower, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Reptite city dragged into time from another dimension</span>. Not only is is very, very long, but it's also full of enemies and minibosses that take long to defeat.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> has the Black Omen, which while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">optional</a> is the game's equivalent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>. It comes complete with a <em>lot</em> of minibosses, some tricky enemies, and a three-form boss at the end. Worse, there's a shop and teleport back to the entrance about a third of the way in, but nothing of the sort at the <em>end</em>, when you'd actually need it to get ready for said boss. It's also possible to abuse time travel to go through this dungeon up to three different times, though the treasure chests in them remain opened after the first time.
</li><li> Several levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a> 2</em> qualify in the higher difficulties, but the most egregious is the Durance of Hate second floor. What makes this example especially annoying is that, besides its incredible length (its area is several times a regular level), there's a chance for it to be filled of Stygian Dolls. Good luck making through that incredibly long level while fighting them every three rooms.
<ul><li> Replace "difficulty" with "tedium" and you have the Maggot Lair in Act 2. You have a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaze">maze</a> of hallways, each a single sprite wide. As in, no enemies or allies can cross another enemy or ally; <em>everything</em> blocks everything's path<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9i3va');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9i3va" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9i3va');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">unless it's an item or a projectile, of course</span>. This means you are forced to fight anything in front of you. And there are lot of things in front of you. And only one melee fighter can attack one enemy at a time. Decided to bring one of the town's lancing mercenaries with you? Well expect them to be either bored or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidalOverconfidence">dead</a>. And if you had the misfortune of going the wrong way, well then it looks like you're going to have to go through said process all over again. Needless to say, it's not one of the game's more attractive experiences.
</li><li> And as far as entire acts, not individual levels, are concerned, Act 3 is the offender. It is not necessarily bigger in terms of size, but the maps are much more labyrinthine and often require serious amounts of backtracking. It is also the main offender in terms of enemy difficulty relative to character level, since the game begins spawning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> in amounts better suited for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnBats">Goddamn Bats</a> roughly in the third act.
</li></ul></li><li> The optional Gladsheim in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnOfTheNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphoniaDawnOfTheNewWorld">Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World</a></em> is so enormous and labyrinthine that the most common method of dealing with it is to get a paper and draw a map of it as you go. There are ten floors, only two of which have save points on them. And don't bother going online to look for a map of the place - it's <em>randomized</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagiNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagiNation">Magi-Nation</a></em>, we have the Shadow Hold. How bad is it? The Shadow Geysers and other dungeons are only about 20-30 mins. The Shadow Hold is at the very least <em>three times that long</em>, with enough dead-ends and false openings to lead anyone insane. It's so bad, it's actually <em>optional</em>.
</li><li> Some dungeons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonSiege">Dungeon Siege</a></em> can take a long time to complete, especially the later ones. One of the worst offenders is the Goblin steampunk dungeon, where your party has to hack through giant mob after giant mob of high-level enemies. Even if you get fed up with it and decide to just rush through, it will still take at least 15 minutes until you finally reach the end.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em> series has a few of these, especially the final dungeons. Bowser's Castle in the first game must have at least 50 rooms in it along with all seven Koopalings, Fawful and the two stage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> to contend with. Partners in Time has Shroob Castle, which is even longer and with four floors of that many rooms each, and Peach's Castle/Fawful's Castle just goes on and on and on and spans a good few hundred rooms plus a trip to the Airway in Bowser's Body. Neo Bowser's Castle from <em>Dream Team</em> is about as long as the first game's final dungeon but it also has three different trips to the Dream World while the dungeon of the same name in <em>Paper Jam</em> takes just as long as Shroob Castle plus several different bosses. Joke's End from the first one might count too, as might the two section Woohoo Hooniversity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em> has several towards the end of the game:
<ul><li> The volcano area is quite lengthy with some hard hitting enemies and it is coupled by a two part boss fight, followed by another two part boss fight after that. Luckily, you catch a break after the first boss fight.
</li><li> Bowser's Keep on the return trip. The castle is extremely long and has enemies that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">kill a party member instantly</a>. The length is padded out mostly due to the trials you have to complete by going through 4 of 6 doors and if you want to get all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">ultimate weapons</a> for the majority of your party, you'll be coming back to those doors that have them if you missed out since completing 4 of the trials puts you in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointOfNoReturn">Point of No Return</a> until you leave the castle and reenter. The end section is then followed up by two boss fights and you don't get a break in between them either.
</li><li> The road to Smithy is a very long one. It's filled with tricky platforming, several boss fights, and respawning enemies on conveyor belts. Luckily, the factory area is very brief as it consists of every room being a major/boss battle with breaks in between.

Not only is it an infamously long trek with constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a> with branching paths that lead to either dead ends or the wrong location entirely, but you have to traverse it <em>multiple times</em>, back and forth in different directions because it is between you and a required destination a multitude of times and you aren't allowed to circumvent it. Once you finally get Viki's mirror some 2/3s into the game you can finally breathe easy.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> game has an extra-long route, or series of route joined together, that you have to tackle. These almost always have no Pokémon Centers or healing NPCs, and usually contain tons and tons of trainers:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Pokémon Red and Blue</a></em> has the first instance of this in the long routes connecting Lavender Town to Fuschia City (thankfully optional, as you can also reach Fuschia City by taking the much faster Bicycle path. If you want the Super Rod, however, you have to take the long route). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></em> lets you visit the same area in the postgame.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em> has the long routes from Mauville to Fortree as well as from Fortree to Lilycove. Near the end of the latter, the path branches off to take you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBoosHaunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBoosHaunt">Mt. Pyre</a> and the game actually prompts you to go there, but not heading to Lilycove first to heal and obtain a fly point is an excercise in madness. And there's the never-ending surfing that plagues the last portion of the game.
</li><li> The Orre games, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a></em>, have Mt. Battle - you are forced to ascend the first Area as per the story, but afterwards you can go back there and scale 100 battles' worth of trainers. You can save on your way up, and transfer to and from each zone on demand, but if you want a special prize from the region, you need to do it all in one run (saves are permitted, mercifully).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Citadark Isle</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a></em>. Longer than any other area in the game, filled with trainer battles and Shadow Pokemon. You also have rematches with all 3 previously-fought bosses, plus two entirely new bosses, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">legendary</a> fight and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. Just to show how insane it is, <em>fully HALF of the game's Shadow Pokemon are located on Citadark Isle.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> has the long walk from Solaceon to Veilstone, which has tall grass so that you can't use your bike and it's capped off with a double battle against a pair of Ace Trainers notorious for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">Boss in Mook Clothing</a> levels of difficulty. There's also this game's version of Victory Road, which is <em>infamous</em> as one of the hardest Victory Roads in the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a>,</em> thankfully eastern Unova and its long routes are confined to the postgame, but in the sequels you have to tackle them in the main story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em>, the longer routes usually have a Pokémon Ranger or other healing NPC to alleviate some of the stress.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>, the Vast Poni Canyon begins with a battle against Hapu before turning into a long trek spanning multiple cave segments, many Trainers, and no Charizard Glide checkpoints until reaching the Trial at the end. Fortunately, Lillie is traveling with you on the first trip, and will heal your team at various points. The final segment of the Canyon, before the Trial, also lets you open a shortcut back to the entrance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueGalaxy">Rogue Galaxy</a></em> has the Ghost Ship, a randomly generated dungeon with 100 floors only accessible in the post-game. Every ten floors is a boss room and on the 100th floor, there's a difficult boss battle. Not too bad, right? Well once you complete it, you can take a quiz at the entrance. If you pass it, which is fairly easy, you can do Ghost Ship EXTREME which is basically the <strong>entire</strong> damn dungeon all over again with even harder bosses and an even harder final boss <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">all for Kisala's swimsuit</a>. And if you have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BallsOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BallsOfSteel">testicular fortitude</a> to do it AGAIN, you can get ANOTHER outfit revealing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolMask">Simon's face</a>.
</li><li> <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</em> perfectly captures the intensity of the battle at Helm's Deep. The party must defeat a very large number of enemies in consecutive battles with no time to recover in-between. The enemy's numbers start to wear on you, and it gets harder as stronger enemies start to spawn towards the end of each. There are save points every few battles, and the party does get to fight along Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli who can one shot anything they attack, but the section takes awhile to beat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a></em> is known for having rather large areas. However, Mechonis takes the cake in terms of length. The areas are all multiple floors and, while smaller than some of the areas before, you have a <em>lot</em> more floors to traverse through. In addition, you have a lot of mechon that will just act as distractions.
</li><li> The Labyrinth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PathOfExile">Path of Exile</a></em> is a series of zones filled monsters and traps, leading to a 3-part battle with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> boss with randomized gimmicks you have to play around.

On the plus side, the reward is quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">substantial</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>'s V1.5 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Survival Mode</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle">fast travelling</a> is disabled, which means you have to physically travel on foot everywhere (aside from teleporting to the Institute) unless you are allied with the Brotherhood of Steel and have access to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue">Vertibird</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits">you can only save at beds</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation">which may have very long trips between</a>.
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> games have a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProlongedPrologue">Prolonged Prologue</a> in the form of a long level before finally attaining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalAirship">Global Airship</a>.
<ul><li> The first level aside from the tutorial in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> is the planet Taris. Not even counting side quests, one must first obtain a disguise from the other side of the city's apartments, head to the Lower City, enter the Bek Base to get security papers to the Undercity, go through the sewers to reach the back entrance of the Vulkar Base to steal a swoop engine, win the swoop race, break in to the Sith Base to steal launch codes, and then head to Davik's Estate before FINALLY leaving the planet. Wow. If that's not bad enough, one cut area from the planet remains mostly intact in the game files, and it's known there was planned to be at least one more area in addition to all that. It is by far the biggest planet in the game, and it's before the convenience of any powers like Force Speed.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> of the first game qualifies not because of how vast the levels are, but because of the unending waves of enemies it sends at you.
</li><li> The closing arc of Nar Shadaa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em> starts with your character venturing into Jekk'Jekk Tarr themselves and getting kidnapped by Goto, punctuated with a battle between Mira and Hanharr in between. Following that is a series of events where your other party members handle various tasks to get to Goto's Yacht to rescue your character before you meet with Zez-Kai Ell and finish the planet. While all this is happening, you don't have free reign about Nar Shadaa until you finish, and if you were in the middle of working out a sidequest (<em>especially</em> involving that broken speeder) you have to abandon it for now. In the Restored Content Mod, the arc is even longer as it adds several sequences where your other party members fight through legions of bounty hunters to get to the Ebon Hawk.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII">Dragon Quest VII</a></em> has quite a bit:
<ul><li> Alltrades Abbey. Right when you appear to get out of a dungeon, the game tosses another obstacle at you... or it makes you redo the floor. It's one of the most maligned levels in Dragon Quest history.
</li><li> Nottagen, if only for the fact that you have to save the island <em>three times</em>, since your first two attempts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">make it WORSE</a>.

If <em>one</em> monster takes 10-15 minutes to defeat, then going against <em>three</em> of them turns the otherwise lengthy 50-minute time limit into a genuine race against time, even when multi-monster quests have the health of each monster slightly lowered, and sometimes even if multiple hunters are involved. Four or five? Good luck with that. The toughest standard or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">DLC</a> missions go for broke, often throwing <strong>five</strong> powerful monsters at you.

If that wasn't enough, there are also enemies where one can reflect physical attacks infinitely and the other can do the same, only with artes. After which, all 3 areas will have a boss fight at the end of their areas and when the three groups converge, they have to fight a boss who has to be damaged in certain phases, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Rean's</a> group being the last. And then there's a Divine Knight battle afterwards with Rean and another member of new Class VII to take down the boss. And if you thought that was over, the final boss of that section is a Duel Boss between Rean and Azure Siegfried (though the battle takes place back beneath the Heimdallr catacombs). All this can take quite a long time to beat, even on a Very Easy difficulty. The final dungeon in comparison, Gral of Erebos, is just a short dungeon with no gimmicks but makes up for it with 3 boss gauntlets with each boss needing 3 specific party members that permanently leave the party after the boss fight is done, the final boss on foot, and two Divine Knight battles.

<ul><li> The Spire, full stop. Its an immense black tower thats far longer and harder to navigate than any of the games other dungeons, on top of being a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultySpike">spike in terms of difficulty</a>.

It was even worse before an update added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorToBefore">shortcut warps</a>, since you had to backtrack through at least half the dungeon every time you wanted to leave and resupply.

</li><li> Eofol Tunnels. It is smaller than Titan's Stronghold, but to compensate for it, it is a maze, and the path from one entrance to another zigzags to make the most of the surface. The fact it is full of Medusae that turn you to stone and are impervious to magic, and Behemoths that hit like their name would suggest and can take Dragon Breath to the face and tell the tale, makes the entire trip last very long.

In the NES version, these were four areas (along with the 3D base/boss segments from the first two stages) were split into their own stages and expanded upon.

The first game, <em>1942</em>, is a realy good example: while the individual levels themselves take around 5-6 minutes to complete, the grand total number of the game levels is 32 stages long; this means completing a whole game takes around 160+ minutes or roughly more than two and a half hours to complete, and that's all done in a single credit clear of the whole game.

Surviving the entire eight-hour drive earns you one point, at which point you turn around and drive back the <em>other</em> way for eight hours. There is no end to the game, or to the torture.

If you use mods, you can combine in <em>American Truck Simulator</em> the Canadream and México Extremo mods to create a behemoth drive from Toronto, ON through Vancouver, BC and the American west coast all the way to Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco that could very well last a whopping 24 IRL hours. Luckily, the game not only has instant saving, but also has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiPoopSocking">Anti Poop-Socking</a> mechanic (the driver's fatigue) that forces you to pull at a truck stop every ~45 minutes of playing time to break your concentration and make it more likely for you to take a break — after all, just like in real life, driving a virtual truck for many continuous hours really is fatiguing.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> games have a mine that goes down for many, many floors. The one in Friends of Mineral Town is 255 floors deep, and you have to get to the bottom in order to get one of the items — luckily, said item is pretty awesome. The deepest mine in DS is some 60,000 floors deep.

The requirements are to eliminate four opponents (each a difficult AI individually, now set up in a combination where appeasing one will almost certainly piss off another two), build both Monument (which require considerable time and resources to build and incur <em>hideous</em> maintenance costs), settle large amounts of top-tier workers of all three factions (which means building and balancing every supply chain in the game), and accumulate a million credits (if you're anywhere near achieving the other goals, you can just leave the game running and wait for this one). Average completion time? Over a day, twenty-four real-life hours, if you already know what you're doing.

First there's a restaurant and tavern, then you enter a secret undeground casino, then there's a sewer passage to Reuben's place, then... Well, you get the picture. This also makes the level somewhat infamous in the game's fandom, as most of the environments are rather bland, the whole level is quite huge and clues to progression are fairly few and far between.

Following that, you need to <em>escape</em> the Flooded District, which means making your way through a large field patrolled by Tallboys, a Wall of Light, and a guard checkpoint. Before you do that though, if you want to complete all of the side objectives you'll need to help a group of civilians escape from a tenement building to safety. <em>Then</em> you need to access the sewers to get back to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Hound Pits Pub</span>, which is even longer if you've helped Granny Rags and Slackjaw out with their sidequests in previous levels, because you'll need to confront them before proceeding and <em>finally</em> ending the level.

<ul><li> The Central Park area is very lengthy with no activity other than one cut scene early on. The random encounter rate seems to kick in at every screen.
</li><li> The sewers under Chinatown are lengthy due to the maze like structure and if you want to find every item in the area, you'll spend a good amount of time exploring every path for them. This area is also padded out by random encounters that have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoddamnedBats">bats that can inflict Blindness on you.</a>
</li><li> The Museum of Natural History is very long on the revisit section in day 5. You're forced to wander all over the museum by going through several hallways or going up floor by floor just to be able to open another room somewhere else. To make matters worse, when you seem to be able to finally confront Eve at the top floor, the mini boss you defeated comes back and knocks you down to the ground floor and a T-Rex comes to life and attacks you. From there, you have to climb back up all over again.
</li><li> Also for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Chrysler Building</a>. 77 floors tall and every floor except the 1st, every 10th and the last 7, have randomized floor layouts so you can't exactly go and remember the patterns. There is an elevator, but you can't use it unless you obtain a key from a boss that is located on every 10th floor.

Then, you have to obtain 2 Grails to unlock a door, one of which protected by 2 sets of 3 suits of armor with Plagas controlling them. Then after Ashley gets kidnapped (again) you have to survive an onslaught of flying insects. <em>Then</em> you have to head to a clock tower to get it running while surviving flaming rocks catapulted at you and the tower is swarming with Zealots inside and out. And when you leave the tower, you have to deal with another crowd (the leader of which has a freaking rocket launcher), then try to simply survive a locked room with TWO Heavy Armor Garradors (the other Zealots in the room are the LEAST of your worries!) And if you should survive <em>that</em>, as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">Press X to Not Die</a> cutscene, the last thing to do is simply survive the encounter with Salazar's 'right hand' until the elevator shows up! Yeesh! Count on spending at <em>least</em> an hour playing through this nightmare. The single hardest part of this level (if not the game PERIOD) is between the start of the clock tower to surviving the cutscene, because there are no typewriters in between, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation">no opportunities to save</a>. All that being said, if you can come out of this level with your sanity intact, give yourself a freaking medal. In the subsequent versions, the programmers at least had the <em>mercy</em> to put a typewriter right after the clock tower, making the fight with the 2 Garradors <em>much</em> easier to prepare for.

Meanwhile, the largest individual level is Military Base in Ichor, which also happens to be <em>very</em> difficult due to the high concentration of enemies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mooks</a>, and is also one of the levels that culminate with a boss battle.

Both of these will extend the number of waves to 99, and will easily take over an hour to finish, even with liberal application of the F key. Unfortunately, you still have to finish to earn medals. Fortunately, the score requirements—usually no more than 200,000 for gold—are absurdly low in proportion; a decent run will see a resource count of over 1 million. Unfortunately, you still need all cores intact to get the gold; lose one core and all of your work will have been for nothing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gemcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gemcraft">Gemcraft</a></em> has two examples:
<ul><li> <em>Chapter Zero</em>'s endurance mode is effectively this, though you're unlikely to beat all 510 waves, as monsters grow in power exponentially, , with last waves being able to have HP well in decillions or somewhere around that mark. The last level also turns out to be this, at 228 waves. While you're supposed to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bomb the Gem of Eternity</span>, you <em>can</em> clear the level the normal way. Also, both <em>Labyrinth</em> and <em>Chasing Shadows</em> have capped number of waves in Endurance on 1337 and 999 waves respectively, though while the first has maximum HP limit for the monsters, it's not the case for the latter and in extreme cases last wave monsters can have up to <em>e100 HP and more</em>.
</li><li> In <em>Chasing Shadows</em>, the first two Vision fields have a whopping 99 waves. Subverted though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> since the level is completed when you charge Ensnaring Nodes and if you beat all waves without doing that you actually fail the level. It can still take time though</span>. The <em>Chapter Zero</em>'s example also returns as a Vision Field and this time you <em>have to</em> beat all 228 waves. You can also turn <em>any</em> level into a Marathon Level via the Battle Traits, which crank up the difficulty and add extra waves.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder24');">    Turn Based Strategy </div><div class="folder" id="folder24" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Item World in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> games tend to be like this, especially in the high-numbered levels. Even if you can leave and save every ten floors, it can be a very long, tedious ten floors unless you have a huge stock of Gency Exits. If you're going for the hyperdrive, you must do 100 floors in one sitting (on the highest level item possible). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em> is even worse - dungeons can literally be thousands of levels deep, and the most number of floors you can skip with an item is 100. (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em>, thankfully, has an "escape" spell - so long as the phantom that can cast it is available, that is. Savvy players Fusion it to Marona.)
</li><li> There are many of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> Chapter 17 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Path of Radiance</a></em>, in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">massive, burnt-out Serenes Forest</span>. It's the longest slog in the game and is the only chapter split into multiple stages. Four of them. Fortunately there are save points between them, and you're also allowed to call in two reinforcements from your party at each stop.
</li><li> The sequel <em>Radiant Dawn</em> had a ton. Chapter 1-6 is split into two stages with only a save point between them. Part 3's endgame is an interesting subversion in that it looks like (and is described as) a massive "rout all the enemies" bloodbath - there is something like 80 enemies <em>to start</em> and tons of reinforcements - but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the battle immedeately ends once any 80 units are killed thanks to an urgent plot development</span>. Still, the enemy phase on every turn takes a <em>long</em> time. Almost every chapter in Part 4 is a tiring rout-all-enemies marathon. Lastly, there is the epic final chapter, split into 5 stages much like <em>PoR</em>'s chapter 17, but you only get to choose 10 units (plus the 5 that are forced and one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Heron</a>) to last all 5 maps. You still get save points and, unintuitively, access to your supply convoy inbetween.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">The Sacred Stones</a></em> has the Tower and Ruins, optional dungeons that are 8 and 10 maps long respectively. They both become increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> the further you go, and you aren't allowed to perma-save between floors. The only consolation is being able to swap anybody you want in or out of your party at each break. You also get to flee anytime (either through the menus or resetting and not choosing to continue the map), which is good to remember considering the series standard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDeathsFinal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllDeathsFinal">All Deaths Final</a>.
</li><li> <em>Every</em> chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> is a Marathon Level. The maps are atypically huge and there are always several castles to seize before you complete the chapter, among other numerous things going on in the meantime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">The Blazing Blade</a></em> has two of these chapters toward the end: "Cog of Destiny", a sprawling map where you must rout the equivalent of a small army to win (with 15 people, of course), and the appropriately-named "Victory or Death", a map so big it has three different routes to your destination, and enemies lying in wait around every corner - including reinforcements that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">literally appear from thin air when you step near them</a></em>.

While they're not particularly long by themselves, it's still an endurance test because you never get a chance to restore your equipment, and you only get one Elixir with three uses. The upshot is that you have two Wo Daos and an Iron Rune, meaning that you'll never take a critical hit and you'll deal them out easily... except on the last two maps where the bosses <em>also</em> have Iron Runes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One of them is a trick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a>, though.</span>
</li><li> An infamous one occurs as early as chapter 3 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem">Mystery of the Emblem</a></em> (Book II) and its DS remake. Your destination is a castle smack in the middle of a huge map, where the enemies have been thoughtful enough to raise the south bridge, forcing your non-flying units to take a <em>long</em> clockwise hike around. While you're capable of taking the bridge key from a village near the start and simply charging in, there's another village way up in the northeast with a useful ally waiting. The issue here? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">Marth is the only unit allowed to visit villages in this game. You also need him to seize the castle to end the map.</a> Enjoy spending 20+ turns marching his butt all the way around if you want everything.
</li><li> In the final chapter of the original <em>Mystery of the Emblem</em>, you must go through all three parts of the chapter without saving or switching party members. This is important because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the clerics can only be saved by certain party members and they must be used in the first part of the chapter</span>. This is no longer the case in the remake where they are considered separate chapters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, the final chapter for all three paths starts immediately after completing Chapter 27 without a chance of saving. Though in <em>Revelation</em>, there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a> in Chapter 16 and 17 for the same reason.

Worse, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a>, but the <em>72 turn limit</em> you have is usually more than enough.

<ul><li> The first game has Chapter 39, "Devils Never Cry". You have to defeat <em>four</em> separate bosses <em>and</em> their armies in order to trigger the actual objective of the level. This takes about an hour to do if you aren't adequately prepared. Ironically, the actual objective, once you reach it, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">Timed Mission</a> (timed in turns, not with an actual clock).
</li><li> The sequel has the final showdown with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Byakushin</a>, who, by this series' standards, takes awhile for the party members to finally <em>injure</em> her. To give players a break down of what they need to do in order: Part 1) Kill off all the starting bosses. Part 2) Kill Dokumezu, Dokugozu, and Sheath. Part 3) Kill Saya. Finally, players can kill off Byakushin. While this happens, Byakushin will keep on summoning monsters to gun for any of the three pillars that players need to defend and while that's happening, Byakushin will keep on firing potshots at your characters when they're in range of her attacks. Anybody caught in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> is as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">good as dead</a>.

Once those are taken care of, enemy reinforcements arrive in the form of the Anti-Spiral Gurren Lagann, Muge Zorbados with some of his own units and Zeravire.

<ul><li> The game takes the trope literally by incorporating several actual marathons in which the player characters can compete, most notably a lengthy triathlon that pretty much circles the game map.
</li><li> The final mission of the game, "End of the Line", takes about half an hour to complete in a game where most mission clock in at about three minutes. Mercifully, it's also the only mission to avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckpointStarvation">Checkpoint Starvation</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>:
<ul><li> Being an updated remake of <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>, it includes more marathon races, with one cranking things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>: the Alamo Sea-to-Los Santos race that requires about 30 minutes of real-time button mashing as the race begins with a swim down virtually the entire length of the inland sea, then an epic-length bike ride, and finally a run through the streets of Los Santos. The game includes several shorter races, as well.
</li><li> GTA V also has two marathon-length side-missions as part of the Epsilon Project mission strand. One requires the player character Michael to wear a certain type of clothing for 10 in-game days (easier said than done as triggering missions or some activities or even saving the game and coming back later can often result in Michael changing his clothes automatically, resetting the clock). The other requires him to walk or run the equivalent of 5 in-game miles within a relatively confined area.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDemonstratingArticle">Reading certain trope pages</a> can feel like this if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">try to read every example.</a>
</li><li> Running marathons, of course. They are 42 kilometers (26 miles) long! There are also half-marathons, which, you guessed it, cover half the distance of a normal one. Ultramarathons are even longer.
</li><li> At a length of 12.9 miles (20.8 km), the Nürburgring Nordschleife (pronounced "Nord-shlife-uh") circuit is the ultimate Marathon Level of Motorsport. It is known less formally, but no less accurately, as "the Green Hell", a term coined by 3-time Formula 1 World Champion Jackie Stewart. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a> stopped racing on this configuration after 1976 because of the sheer length, lack of runoff between the track and the barriers, and driver fatigue (drivers attempted to boycott the race that year, which showed how desperate everyone was to finally stop). When it's not being used for official races, it's an effective tourist attraction, where people can drive it for a fee. Automakers also rent out the track for certain periods in order to try setting, and in some cases breaking, the overall production car lap record (which currently sits at 6:47:25, having been set by factory driver Lars Kern driving the 2018 Porsche 911 <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GT2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GT2">GT 2</a> RS); its ample assortment of road layouts in a single track also makes it very attractive for manufacturers to test the performance of their sports cars.
</li><li> At 37.73 miles (60.725 km), the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_TT_Mountain_Course">Isle of Man time attack circuit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is nearly <em>three times</em> the length of the Nordschleife. Unlike the Nordschleife, the Isle of Man circuit is mainly composed of public roads and is mainly tackled by motorcycles. As of 2020, the current overall lap record is 16:42.778, set by British rider Peter Hickman in 2018 on a BMW S1000RR.
</li><li> And those are the track examples. In terms of actual events, endurance racing is entirely centered around this. Races are usually measured in time lasting anywhere from 3 to 24 hours - yes, you heard that right - with multiple classes, each class having cars that compete within it, on the track at the same time, which means lapping of traffic is a primary staple. Whoever crosses the finish line in first place after the clock runs out is declared the winner, both overall and in class. Since, of course, it is physically impossible to drive race cars - especially the fastest class or on tough tracks like the aforementioned Nordschleife, multiple drivers - anywhere from 2 to 5 depending on race, track, or regulations - share one car, with swapping taking place mid-race during pit stops. It is perhaps the most physically and mentally demanding of all sports, as a driver must manage the car pace, most of it's gadgets, the tyre wear, the fuel load and mileage, slow and fast traffic, and his own stamina. Likewise, it is also the most rewarding, as teams and drivers can get millions of dollars of prize money according to success and race prestige, but more importantly personal satisfaction with having done an incredible feat most people can only dream of. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwentyFourHoursOfLeMans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwentyFourHoursOfLeMans">24 Hours of Le Mans</a> is the world's most famous and prestigious of them.
