Usually, they just want to take advantage of the basic 'theme' of that period, and figure that most viewers won't be able to tell the difference, anyway.
</p><p>The other, equally onerous culprit for simplifying history is nostalgia, especially where dealing with recent history. For example, you almost never will find a movie or show set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> that does not paint the time as an idealistic period. In that period, we're told, every person below the age of 25 was a free-thinker and activist, kids cared about the future and were willing to fight for it, everybody had orgies all the time, and revolution was just around the corner ... or that's how nostalgia would have it seem.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>It gets worse with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>. Since many writers grew up in the Fifties, it's rarely shown as anything but wholesome and brilliant, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButHits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButHits">Nothing but Hits</a> blaring out of every radio and every teenager playing rock'n'roll. Despite the continuing mistreatment of black people, the lead in paint, gasoline and <em>food cans</em>, and the threat of nuclear war, the Fifties is often considered something of a golden age as much as the jazz-heavy party overdose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">The Roaring '20s</a> (the Klan was experiencing a revival and you could die if you drank bootleg) or the glitter and grandeur of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> (there was a point where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> was about to end badly and music since then has been mostly done by computers). The worst parts of these decades and even earlier eras are similarly not brought up or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">totally ignored</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>The reverse is also often true; the late 60s (especially if set around the Vietnam War) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> — which, not entirely coincidentally, many of these writers were no longer growing up in, being adults — will be subject to an inverted Nostalgia Filter, being painted in a very negative light, with all innocence lost and the dream most <em>definitely</em> being over: Cities are living hellholes, young men are sent to a sure death and the government uses dirty tricks against its people. The same for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, which will be portrayed as a time everyone was either moping or panicking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Y2K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Y2K">Y2K</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoughties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoughties">The Noughties</a> also being a time that paranoia was all around and an economic meltdown was just round the corner. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThirties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThirties">The '30s</a> are just <em>that</em>, the 30s (aka Great Depression and Hitler). The negative aspects of these decades will be stressed, and any positive things quietly ignored (except for those who lived in those eras, for whom the filter will be in full effect). Also, the creativity and experimentalism of such decades is often understated in favor of overemphasis on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Camp">camp</a>, cheesy, and kitsch aspects of their popular culture (with all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">Pandering to the Base</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">Lowest Common Denominator</a> that entails). This causes later generations to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">not take these decades seriously</a>.
</p><p>This is so all-pervading that it affects even younger writers who weren't even alive during the decade in question, as a kind of "proto-nostalgia". This could have something to do with the way pop-cultural output is treated; between the 20- and 30- years ago mark is when the clothes go from hideously dated to retro chic, the TV shows from ubiquitous reruns to material that has to be sought out, the cars from clapped-out clunkers to seldom-seen, cherished classics and the music from stuff the "new music" stations play on the commercial-free Sunday afternoons to bona-fide oldies. Similarly, the cultural output that is remembered and stands the test of time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">tends to be the good stuff</a> (or at least, the stuff that the majority of people enjoyed), with the rubbish being quickly left behind or forgotten; as such, we tend to remember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> as being a time of great music because the stronger music of the decade keeps getting played and covered and included on soundtracks, whereas the rubbish music (or at least, the music that no one listened to) has been quietly forgotten except by vintage music geeks (who, of course, will be casually looked down upon as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hipster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hipster">Hipsters</a>.
</p><p>Nostalgists will always insist that they want a return <em>only</em> to the "good stuff" of the past, <em>not</em> the "bad stuff" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">(notwithstanding the difficulty of reaching a consensus on what exactly was "good" or "bad")</a>. They will most likely condemn the regrettable old stuff vehemently, declaring that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">it was a "betrayal" of the "true", unvarnished ideal of the past and that decent people disapproved of it back then</a>. At worst, they will (neurotically) defend bad things from the past as necessary evils — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidNeutral">the price one somehow had to pay for the good stuff</a>.
</p><p>Of course, there are plenty of (often younger) writers who happen to like the present fine, thank you very much, and can be quite keen on skewering this trope by pointing out exactly what they think was wrong about the past (often with a none-too-subtle '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">screw you</a>' directed at the perpetrators of this kind of mindset in the process). This even applies to decades once portrayed positively: the 1950s are now often presented as a nation-wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSuburbia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSuburbia">repressive prison for everyone not straight, white, cisgendered, and male (complete with ironic sitcom trappings)</a>. This is not surprising, as all the writers mentioned above <em>did the same thing</em> when they were young. Suffice to say that these young, hip writers so eager to take the past down a peg will in twenty years' time be as irrationally nostalgic for the 2010s as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> is for the Fifties or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a> is for the Eighties.
</p><p>This trope is not nearly as awesome today as it was in past centuries. For example, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stendhal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stendhal">Stendhal</a> (1783-1842), everything went downhill after the fall of Napoleon, but at least he lived through Napoleon's reign, unlike Gibbon, who thought the world went to hell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">after the death of Marcus Aurelius, in 180 AD.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hesiod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hesiod">Hesiod</a> insisted things had been going wrong at least since the invention of <em>iron</em>. Even ancient Sumer has clay tablets dating to around 2500 B.C. with similar complaints, making it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>.

The story also dealt with the McCarthyism paranoia of the 50s. On the other hand, JFK in the coda is all but treated as <em>the</em> saintly embodiment of everything good, virtuous, and true.
</li><li> The first arc of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Phonogram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Phonogram">Phonogram</a>'', Rue Brittania, explores this trope. The story basically involves the protagonist, a magician and music lover, coming into conflict with 'retromancers' who are attempting to magically rewrite Britain's cultural scene in order to ensure that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">their musical tastes don't go out of fashion</a>. This eventually results in him facing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of the musical genre of Britpop, resurrected by the retromancers as a decaying zombie-like figure, to whom he makes the point that its ultimately better to be a fondly-remembered relic of a much-loved time thats been and gone rather than become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie">decaying corpse that keeps on going because you cant admit its all over and you dont know how to stop</a>. The story is ultimately about the protagonist accepting that his particular music tastes arent the cutting edge any more because thats the nature of pop music, and learning to move on from his nostalgic memories of the era to a still-fond but more rounded memory of the time.
</li><li> Averted again with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SandmanMysteryTheatre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SandmanMysteryTheatre">Sandman Mystery Theatre</a></em>, which actually dealt with issues like the rampant racism of the 30's and 40's. This is notable since in general, most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCUniverse">DC Universe</a> publications seem to have a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeofComicBooks">the Golden Age</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Planetary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Planetary">Planetary</a></em> subverts this trope at one point; one issue takes them to a funeral for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">John Constantine</a> which is attended by other homages to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VertigoComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VertigoComics">Vertigo Comics</a> characters of the 1980s and 1990s.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AcrossTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AcrossTheUniverse">Across the Universe</a></em> is a film that eulogizes the passing of the 1960s.
<ul><li> May actually be a bit of a subversion, since (for example) the hippy spiritualist is a massive dick, the antiwar protester is a mad bomber, and the general veneer of "man, the 60's were awesome!" is relatively thin over rather more realistic depictions of the era.
<ul><li> Actually that stuff is a reference to the perception that the anti-war and hippie movements lost their "innocence" when the seventies rolled around. The "mad bomber" is a reference to the Weather Underground, and the asshole spiritualist is meant to represent the "movement" selling out and moving to the west coast.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> plays with this. At first, shows the Fifties to be extremely bright and happy. But then some darker aspects show up. Racism is mentioned, for instance. Marty's mother is shown to be a somewhat promiscuous smoker and drinker, and Biff Tannen is a Grade A bully and attempted-rapist.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissPettigrewLivesForADay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissPettigrewLivesForADay">Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day</a></em>; the movie is something of a pastiche of 1930s screwball comedies, and so is set amongst a wide array of glitzy fashion houses and nightclubs and glamorous apartments, with everyone having lots of fun and living it up, and everything's swanky and wonderful... but it's set in 1939, and there's plenty of ominous foreshadowing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> is on it's way and about to really shake things up for these people. Furthermore, the titular protagonist starts the movie homeless, and her miserable situation isn't entirely glossed over.
</li><li> Appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoogieNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoogieNights">Boogie Nights</a></em>, which is set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a> porn scene during the late seventies and early eighties. Whilst not exactly perfect — it <em>is</em> the porn industry, after all — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> are depicted as being a colorful and carefree time, and considering the setting quite innocent as well; everyone's largely happy, everything's going well, and everything's bright and cheerful. Then along come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>. The Eighties suck for all concerned. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, the porn industry took a hit in the 80's with the onset of AIDS, VHS replacing film and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Reagan</a> administration declaring war on it.
<ul><li> The movie follows a similar plot structure to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></em>, which depicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> as being a time when everything's going pretty well, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> as a really sucky time for everyone. Although even less rosy than <em>Boogie Nights</em> - <em>Goodfellas</em>, after all, deals with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> - the similar structure nevertheless paints <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> as a time of optimism for its characters, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> as a time when everything came crashing down. In both cases cocaine (and the main characters' increasing addiction to it) plays a strong role in the misery that follows.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> are portrayed even more idyllically, with Henry describing it (in almost those exact words) as the Golden Age of Wiseguys.
</li><li> It actually goes as far to deconstruct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> as a time marked by postwar trauma.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The specific idealization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> is parodied and ultimately subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pleasantville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pleasantville">Pleasantville</a></em>; the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em>-style television show is initially an innocent and 'wholesome' reflection of the 1950s and the elements of which that are usually yearned after (the nuclear family, clean and pleasant suburbia, etc). Then, when the 'color' that the two real-life kids who have entered the world of the show begins to spread, the resulting tensions between the citizens who are in color and those who are still black-and-white begin to reflect and demonstrate the uglier side of the decade that is often played down, such as racial discrimination and political repression. However, the movie does this in such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">anvilicious</a> fashion that some believe it acts to the detriment of the film (the town literally has no world outside it at first, sex literally doesn't exist instead of happening offscreen, etc).
</li><li> The Richard Curtis film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked">The Boat That Rocked</a></em> (<em>Pirate Radio</em> in the US) is a nostalgic celebration of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> counterculture but also notes some of the less pleasant elements, especially the way 'free love' could morph into selfishness and amoral hedonism. As one character puts it: "the dark side of rock and roll."
</li><li> In the René Clair film <em>Les Belles de nuit</em> (1952), Gérard Philipe's character has vivid Walter-Mitty-like dreams which always start out romantically but which end with him getting into trouble. In them he always meets an old man who tells him how bad this particular era is and how much better things were in the old days, setting up that the next dream will be set in the "good old days" referred to. Thus the first dream is set in the Sahara before World War 1, the second during the French Revolution etc. In the end he dreams of being in the Stone Age and even there the old man shows up to tell him how things have gone downhill since the good old days.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DazedAndConfused" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DazedAndConfused">Dazed and Confused</a></em> both plays this straight and subverts it. It portrays, for the most part, an idealized, nostalgia-inducing view of the 1970's, yet also shows how people are often discontent with a period simply because it's the present. At one point in the film, a girl is shown talking about the "every other decade rule"; the 50's were lame, the 60's were great, and the 70's obviously suck, and maybe the 80's will be awesome. Additionally, Pink says "If I ever start referring to these as the best years of my life, remind me to kill myself."
</li><li> Played with and ultimately subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoCountryForOldMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoCountryForOldMen">No Country for Old Men</a></em>. Throughout the plot, Sheriff Bell despairs for the modern world and how it could let someone like Anton Chigurh live unmolested in it, and generally holds the belief that nobody like Chigurh would have been able to do so much evil in the old days. However, towards the end Bell talks to his Uncle, who relays the story of how his grandfather was killed - Shot on his own porch by a group of Native Americans, who stood and watched as he bled to death on his own steps. Bell's uncle tells him that men like Chigurh have always existed and always have done evil, and bluntly tells Bell that thinking the past was any better is no more than vanity.
</li><li> Explored in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightInParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightInParis">Midnight in Paris</a>:</em> Owen Wilson's character is transported back to the 1920s, a time period he idolizes. While there, he meets a woman from that time period, and both of them are transported back even further to the Belle Époque, which time period she idolizes. The artists there, however, idolize the Renaissance. Owen Wilson realizes that it's better to just make the most of the present than try to live in the past.
</li><li> Averted remarkably in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FarFromHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FarFromHeaven">Far from Heaven</a></em>. Roger Ebert notes the great pains the filmmakers took to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">film it like a movie from 1950s Connecticut,</a> which is an extraordinary accomplishment. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0t226');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0t226" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0t226');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Its themes, values and style faithfully reflect the social melodramas of the 1950s, but it's bolder, and says out loud what those films only hinted at [...] The civil rights revolution predated gay liberation by about 10 years, and you can see that here: The movie doesn't believe Raymond and Cathy have a plausible future together, but there is bittersweet regret that they do not. When Frank meets a young man and falls in love, however, the affair is not ennobled but treated as a matter of motel rooms and furtive meetings. Haynes is pitch-perfect here in noting that homosexuality, in the 1950s, still dared not speak its name.</span> Gender roles are paralyzingly rigid for both men and women: sex is a chore for housewives to giggle at over martinis, and they work hard to maintain an outward appearance of flawlessness and gaiety only to lash out in infinitely subtle ways. White people are generally in favor of some nebulous concept called "equal rights for the Negro" but openly criticize integration. Black people are hardly champions of racial harmony either - when a Black man brings a White woman to a Black establishment for dinner and dancing, the other patrons see it as a violation of their safe space. A doctor gently tells his patient he has a modern view of homosexuality - if you're willing to work hard enough, there's a small chance you can be cured. And there's no scene where people defiantly flaunt their liberal views, and everybody has a change of heart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>. The Black love interest decides to put on elephant-sized blinders and simply ignore the way everyone else sees his friendship with a White woman (in the dinner scene everyone is staring at them angrily, making comments, and he smiles and says, "See? This is a welcoming place!") and he and his family end up paying for it dearly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABronxTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABronxTale">A Bronx Tale</a></em> is rife with aversions. While the narrator does fondly remember his youth during the 50's and 60's, the movie doesn't shy away from showing the racial tension and violence of the era. Even C's father, one of the nicer and less-bigoted characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage">states that people should only marry within their own race</a>. That's not even getting into the horribly racist attitudes displayed by C's Italian-American buddies...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLovelyBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLovelyBones">The Lovely Bones</a></em> is far more nostalgic to the seventies than its book counterpart - with period appropriate music and a color palette that evokes works made in the decade. This only serves to highlight the tragedy of Susie's murder; she even says that it took place in a time before people thought children actually did go missing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StandByMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StandByMe">Stand by Me</a></em> serves to deconstruct the wholesome 1950s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverytownAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverytownAmerica">Everytown, America</a> in the lives of its four child protagonists. Gordie's parents favored his dead brother and his dad secretly wishes he had died instead. Teddy's father likewise is an abusive traumatised World War II veteran, and Chris' father is mentioned to beat him hard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/It2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/It2017">It (2017)</a></em> is a lot more nostalgic than the book. The book was set in the 50s but the film updates it to the 80s, so that it will be nostalgic for the current audience of grown-up 80s kids. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewKidsOnTheBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewKidsOnTheBlock">New Kids on the Block</a> fans, a character who resembles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MollyRingwald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MollyRingwald">Molly Ringwald</a> and plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightiesHair">'80s Hair</a> galore. But the adults of the town are blissfully unaware of the malevolent force that's attacking and kidnapping the children.
</li><li> Downplayed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberMe">Remember Me</a></em>, which is a 2010 drama that appears to be a slightly nostalgic look at the early 2000s. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> But then the lead character dies in the 9/11 attacks</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ARoyalNightOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ARoyalNightOut">A Royal Night Out</a></em> is at first a harmless <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomanHoliday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomanHoliday">Roman Holiday</a></em>-esque comedy in 1945 London, showing off the fashions and music of the period as the citizens celebrate VE Night. But then it shows what a transitional time it was, with another character reminding everyone "there's still a war going on in the Far East", the male lead is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell-Shocked Veteran</a> who had his idealism shattered by the death of his best friend and even when the celebration start - you still see weeping couples mourning the friends and family they lost.

Curiously, the 'modern times' they can't get the hang of are the 1970s, and the hero bluntly tells them that whilst the decade isn't perfect, they have to suck it up and move on; they have no right to force their outdated ways on the present just because they can't get the hang of decimalisation.

The 30s seem like a craptastic world where America is replaced by a wasteland that actively tries to kill anyone, no institutionalized justice exists, bigotry is rampant, the poor are callously abused and imprisoned, and even Messiahs have to harm people to perform miracles. This makes sense since probably the only people who have ever idealized the Thirties were those who were actually there, and for the most part they probably only did it while they were actually happening - because, after all, how else are you supposed to get through such a rough time?

</li><li> Occurs in-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> when King Robert fondly reminisces of when he was younger and he was a warrior instead of a king, and Renly calls him out on glorifying a period when the empire was torn apart by civil war and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">senile, destructive king</a>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em> episode "Old School" centers around Peralta's idealization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">70's</a> police work. Eventually, Captain Holt ends up informing him that the 70's were a dark time for the NYPD, and that in addition to the drug epidemic and high crime rates, the department itself was a hotbed of racism, misogyny, and homophobia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em> tends to be good about addressing racism and sexism in the past.

Indeed, both Sara and Kendra end up getting treated with the same disrespect most 50's men afforded women. In addition, Kendra and Jax had to deal with the overt racism of that time. Sara did her best to convince a lesbian nurse that there was nothing wrong with her preferring women over men. As for what happens when the Legends travel to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">Civil War</a>-era South...
</li><li> In the same vein, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Timeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Timeless">Timeless</a></em> did not hide the racism and sexism of the past, which popped up fairly often, given that one of the protagonists is black, and the other is a woman. Rufus actually initially refuses to go into the past, pointing out to his Black British boss that there is no time in the American past where his skin color wouldn't be a problem. The only time, where his skin color actually <em>saves</em> the team is when they are captured by a Native American tribe during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SevenYearsWar">French and Indian War</a>, and their chieftess is about to execute Lucy and Wyatt, while letting Rufus go (assuming him to be a slave and thus not free to be there). Rufus's staunch defense of his friends impresses the chieftess enough to release them all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> has an episode where everyone gets sent back in time to the 60s. She at first loves the peace and love aspect of the era - but then she discovers the blatant sexism of the day when colleges won't accept her because of her gender. She likewise realises how shallow the hippie lifestyle is - Harvey's ambition is simply to travel the country in a van "following the music" after school is over.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em> serves to highlight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a> of the 80s - particularly when Will disappears and his mother is at her wit's end trying to find him with the limited technology of the era. It's also considerably easier for the villains to cover up their dirty deeds than it would be these days. The racist and homophobic insults the school bullies casually throw at the child protagonists also are a reminder of how less tolerant the 80s actually were.

They included Cassette tapes (Impossible to fast forward accurately and easy to break), mom and pop stores (How many people actually use them?), talking instead of text messaging, and neighborhood crime (That's right, there are actually people who think being able to walk through the streets of Manhattan without the very real fear of death is a step down from the old days).

<ul><li> At the end of <em>The Revelation</em>, Church ends up trapped in a memory unit and decides to look for Tex by reliving the events of Blood Gulch, because, "If you're going to be trapped in a memory, it might as well be a good one." Come Season 9, and the first we see of Church has him bitterly complaining that he forgot how much he hated working in Blood Gulch, and for good reason. Back then, the Reds and Blues were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedFarces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedFarces">Armed Farces</a> in every sense in the term, and the camaraderie they developed during Seasons 6-8 doesn't exist. When Church tried to negotiate with the Reds, they shot him in the foot, with Tucker and Caboose not caring enough to help.

When doing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> on "Re-View", Mike mentions how despite all the problems they have with it he still prefers it to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville">The Orville</a></em> because it is new and original while the latter is too-much like Next Generation in terms of retro production feel and the recycled ideas used in the stories he literally could not watch more than five episodes.

<ul><li> This trope is called out in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>. Ray reminisces on the Fifties and notes what a simpler time they are. Egon tells him that there's no inherent proof of that, and that each decade has its own individual challenges.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> does this when some of the heroes end up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a>-style alternate universe. Green Lantern doesn't quite know how to take being called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace">a credit to his race</a>. The episode could also be viewed as a more pragmatic look at the comic books released during that time, free from the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a> fans look through with them. The catchphrases and corny lines are often painful to listen to and the villains behave in such absurd ways you get the sense a story like this would never be published today. On the other hand, all those elements were a ton of fun to watch due to how goofy they were and ultimately, sacrificed themselves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> for the second time</span> to save the world, being real heroes. Notably, the original draft of the script had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a> as characters, but the creators were forced to change the characters to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> versions of the originals called the Justice Guild, apparently because DC Comics was hesitant to have the real characters shown in that light.

<ul><li> Stan, despite not having grown up in the early 20th century, longed for the "simpler days" where men ruled everything instead of 'most' of everything and women had no say. When his boss sends him to Saudi Arabia, he is reluctant until he realizes they hold the "old fashioned values" he held dear. This eventually backfired when Francine was about to be executed for singing and dancing in public while wearing lingerie and kissing other men.
<ul><li> Of course, Saudi Arabia makes American culture even at its most puritanical look pretty open-minded. The Saudi government bans women's underwear ads, for example.
</li></ul></li><li> The only reason he's sympathetic is because he's outright <em>nostalgically deluded</em>; his "white male" childhood was as a low-class criminal's abused son, yet he worked hard and succeeded in life by having a dream of what his life <em>should</em> have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">and then striving to make that dream for his children</a>. In almost every episode featuring his childhood, he has convinced himself that since he is American, he had a loving family and was filthy rich compared to people in many other countries (which is sadly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>), but his kids see through it and it's clearly shown how much it affects their lives (his daughter is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapBoxSadie">Soap Box Sadie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie">New-Age Retro Hippie</a>, his son is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JockDadNerdSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JockDadNerdSon">Jock Dad, Nerd Son</a>, almost exactly the opposite of what he wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllAmericanBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllAmericanBoy">to be</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> is a whole show built around this trope. It's both a love letter to and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of 60's animation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeofComicBooks">the Silver Age</a> comic books, and takes pains to illustrate "No, the 60's weren't necessarily the paradise people built it up to be." The flashback scenes almost always contain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>, such as shocking instances of casual racism or misogyny that were deemed perfectly okay back then.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Member Berries" has the titular berries, which are talking grapes that spout off about how great something from the past was (primarily <em>Star Wars</em> references) used to help alleviate the stress of today. However, after a while they talk about how great things like how marriage being exclusive to men and women were, or how much they liked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">real stormtroopers</a>. It turns out that they're central to Season 20's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>: They intend to use unchecked nostalgia and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility">Creative Sterility</a> it induces/encourages to convince people to vote for the hideously unqualified Mr. Garrison as the President of the United States in order to ruin the world, a parody of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s presidential campaign and the tendency of mainstream pop culture in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> to be built around adaptations, sequels, remakes, reboots, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback">Genre Throwbacks</a> instead of fresh concepts due to laziness and greed.
<ul><li> However, Season 20 suffered by several rewrites caused by the fact that Parker and Stone based the whole plot on Hillary Clinton's victory, and when that didn't happen several plot threads became irrelevant or went nowhere. The Member Berries' storyline itself was never resolved, and the idea of nostalgia being harmful becomes disconnected from the story or outright hypocritical (for example, the characters ranting on how the new <em>Star Wars</em> films suck becomes moot when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s demise is based on Han Solo and Kylo Ren's confrontation in <em>The Force Awakens</em>).

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> is a popular aphorism of unknown origin; suggested sources include satirist Peter de Vries and, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Yogi Berra</a>; also sometimes attributed to Stan Kenton.
</li><li> Most of the nostalgia towards the past is based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Nostalgia Filter</a>. The good stuff is remembered and the bad stuff ignored, forgotten or not even taken in account. When it's about a time period <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">Two Decades Behind</a> people will be nostalgic for it because they experienced it themselves, but from the viewpoint of a child or a teenager, when they didn't have to worry about all the adult stuff that depresses them nowadays, because the grownups took care of all that: taxes, work, bills, tragic news events,... If the nostalgia is about a time period people didn't directly experience themselves the romanticism is even more rampant. People will base their rosy posy image of that time period on stuff they have seen and read in books, comic strips, cartoons, TV series, films, old photos and/or fond memories of older family members. Usually they aren't aware that many things they now take for granted didn't always exist back then or were still considered highly controversial.
<ul><li> The glories of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Ancient Greece</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a> where the cradle of philosophy and science started, everyone is able to enlist in the army (well, if you weren't a woman or a slave, of course) and see the world while doing so. You can go and enjoy watching Olympic Games, a play in the theater or watch exciting gladiator battles in the arena, philosophers like Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and Virgil are respected as pillars of their societies, and people were opened to sex and LGBT as opposed to the close-minded Christians in later centuries. Not taken in account: class systems, people dying early of diseases we nowadays have proper treatment for, slavery, democracy only for rich upperclass males citizens, bloody battles, Roman military service had to be fulfilled several <em>years</em>! before you could retire and start a civilian life, women having no rights, not even allowed to watch sporting games, xenophobia was so prevalent that would make modern prejudices and bigotry look tame, scientific contributions were more based on superstitions and empirical and weren't always based on logic (see Plato's and Aristotle's works), pederasty was the only accepted form of homosexuality and it was punishable if a relationship did not fit in those criteria (also it was only tolerated in some city and states), Roman sexuality was still arguably patriarchal and not all sexual taboo was acceptable (ie. a wealthy man get away with his slaves while married women were expected to be faithful, oral sex was considered shameful).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DynastiesFromShangToQing">thousand years of Chinese dynasties</a> up until Republic was the time where people dressed in beautiful colorful <em>haifu</em> with good etiquette and manners, scholars were appreciated, education was valued as opposed during the Cultural Revolution, the Tang Dynasty was the golden age of prosperity and where women has more rights than any other periods. Not taken in account: the Confucians were oppressive against the lower social classes, the caste system, education systems were corrupted with many scholars and students were promoted based on bribes rather than actual skills, women were still considered inferior in the Tang Dynasty, the royal court were so deadly and decadent that would make the place in <em>wuxia</em> media look tame, slavery, the rebellions and civil wars (ie. The Three Kingdoms, An Lushan Rebellion, Taiping Rebellion) that were very common that cost million of lives that went unheard of and resulted in many famine and diseases that led to cannibalism, footbinding was practiced since the Song Dynasty, xenophobia was prevalent including against their sister countries like Japan and Korea.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleAges">Middle Ages</a> are usually romanticized as a glorious past with chivalrous knights fighting for the honor of beautiful princesses, proving their worth in tournaments, stuffing themselves at royal buffets with the kind old king, and defending castles against malevolent invaders. Not taken in account: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">The Plague</a>, wars, mercenaries and soldiers plundering farms and villages, filthy streets, people dying at a young age because of insufficient knowledge of diseases, the injustice of the feudal system, monarchs and the Catholic Church being oppressive towards people with other viewpoints, high illiteracy, people executed and tortured for audience's pleasure and often without anything resembling a fair trial, women considered being lesser in status than men, famine whenever harvests failed... Ironically, the part that was arguably good, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a> (with its extremely high literacy and such luxuries as running water) is usually overlooked or completely ignored.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheEnlightenment">The Enlightenment</a> are the time when society finally got out of the bleak, primitive and God fearing Dark Middle Ages and gained wisdom by discovering a lot of stuff. Kings and queens never looked more magnificent. Artists and sculptors painted the finest works and humanists, philosophers and Protestants learned humanity to think for themselves. You could enjoy a Shakespeare play, listen to baroque classical music or have a swashbuckling duel. Not taken in account: A lot of new thought and discoveries in the field of science were very slowly adapted into society. Mostly because a lot of royals, religious authorities and other government officials suppressed these "dangerous" new ideas. Compared to those "primitive" Middle Ages more people have been hanged or burned on the stake for their beliefs and/or on the assumption that they were witches during the 1500s, 1600s and 1700s than in the centuries before! The Reformation and Counter-Reformation divided Europe and caused many casualties. All the great books and art works created during this era were only enjoyed or experienced by the very rich. Wars still ravaged Europe, colonization exploited other continents, slavery became a real industry and absolutism made the monarchy and nobility so powerful and decadent that they didn't care about the lower classes. Duels weren't glorious at all, just a matter of killing off your opponent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfPiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfPiracy">The Golden Age of Piracy</a> is one big adventure where you could go on a boat trip with pirates and have fun attacking other ships, taking gold and bury or search for treasure on some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesertedIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesertedIsland">Deserted Island</a>. Men were real men with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBeard">Badass Beard</a> and cool looking eye patches, hooks for hands and wooden legs. Not taken in account: scurvy, people forced to do what their captain told them, your ship being attacked by other ships and losing, keelhauling, loot just being spent instead of buried, anti-piracy laws could get you arrested and hanged, storms could destroy your ship, all the cool looking eye patches, hooks for hands and wooden legs were just practical solutions for grievous injuries suffered during fights, and the fact that most of the Caribbean economy was reliant on the slave trade. There were also plenty of brutal attacks on helpless villages, indigenous communities, plantations, civilian ships, and even colonial settlements. In addition to helping themselves to everything that wasn't tied down, pirates would also torture, murder, enslave, and/or rape men, women, and children indiscriminately just for their own sick pleasure.
</li><li> America's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">Wild West</a> is a fun era where you could roam the prairie on a horse, visit saloons and shoot outlaws and Indians. Not taken in account: slavery was not abolished until deep in the 19th century and still going on in many colonies or remote places in the American South, cowboys took care of cattle and didn't engage in gun fights, gun violence was just as illegal back then as it is nowadays and could get you arrested by local sheriffs, outlaws could actually remain on the loose for several years, Native Americans being massacred by white settlers and armies, black people having no basic human rights, The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">Ku Klux Klan</a> was a respected organization...
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictorianBritain">mid-to-late 19th century</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEdwardianEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEdwardianEra">early 20th century</a> were a classy time period where everybody was impeccably dressed and had good manners. You could take a coach ride or (later on) test the "horseless carriage", read some of the greatest novels in history, listen to the first records or even the great Caruso in person, admire the wonders of electricity and enjoy a world still untouched by modern industry. Life in the colonies was even more fun because you so many countries were still unexplored territory and the ideal place for adventure. Not taken into account: Victorian values were dominant, women couldn't vote, poor people couldn't vote, industrialization didn't have any health, safety or ethical rules to obey, child labor was rampant, workers had no rights, factories were very harmful to people's health and the environment, city rivers were open sewers, upper class had all the advantages upon the lower class, people could be sent to the poor house when they couldn't pay their debts, many novels were just pulp (think of it as the 19th century version of Internet) and music was strictly symphonic, the first automobiles were as dangerous as electricity, colonization was great for white Europeans but not as much for the oppressed native populations of Africa and Asia, animals were still hunted down as trophies, people who looked different were exploited in freak shows and circuses for spectators to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComeToGawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComeToGawk">Come to Gawk</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenteelInterbellumSetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenteelInterbellumSetting">Interbellum</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoaringTwenties">1920s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">1930s</a>): Between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">the two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">world wars</a>, life was great. Everybody went to night clubs and/or revue theaters where they could enjoy great jazz music, girls and comedians. Movie theaters were a great place to be, because fantastic cinematic masterpieces were made. On the radio you could great music and serials, and newspapers published the best and most engaging comic strips ever printed. Not taken in account: From 1920 until 1933 alcohol was prohibited in the USA, so having an alcoholic drink was impossible without getting arrested or dying because of bad homemade brew. Crime was able to organize itself in a way that will probably never get untangled again. Many people got murdered in gangster violence. Jazz music was initially seen as "barbaric" just because it was made by blacks, and it had to be adapted to symphonic music to make it well-known. Hollywood in its early years was subject to more scandals than ever since, leading to a industry-wide censorship that lasted until the 1960s. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">The Great Depression</a> between 1929 and 1940 caused major unemployment and poverty in many civilized countries, also forcing quite some people to start a life in crime. The "Dust Bowl" generated a desertification of the Midwest. Germany was particularly struck hard, because the country was still paying huge war debts to other countries, causing mass poverty and the ideal atmosphere for Nazism to gain voters. Many countries during this time period suffered under either Nazism, Fascism or Communism. From 1933 on Jewish, homosexual, Romani and left wing people were already persecuted in Nazi Germany, at the same time disagreeing in anything with Stalin meant a one-way ticket to Siberia. War was already brewing in Europe and the Far East, when Japan invaded China and South East Asia. Many countries were still colonies, which wasn't a great deal for the natives there. Afro-Americans were still second class citizens and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KuKluxKlan">Ku Klux Klan</a> was still quite powerful in many political circles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a>, the time where the entire world was united against a common evil foe and soldiers could still fight for a just cause. Everybody worked together to defeat the Axis Powers, while enjoying great Hollywood films and jazz and big band records on the radio. Not taken in account: Not everyone was united against the Axis. Numerous people (even Lindbergh and Ford) didn't consider Nazism or Fascism anything bad or felt their country should stay neutral in the war. During the occupations many people <em>on both sides</em> were arrested, deported, and/or murdered. People couldn't trust anyone, because your neighbor might be a Nazi collaborator or a spy who would turn you in to the authorities. The Nazis banned American and English music and films in Europe, so you could get in <em>big</em> trouble if you tried. Also, you know, <em>there was a big war on</em>. Millions of young soldiers were drafted and died on the battlefield, cities were bombed and occupied by enemy armies, you could die any day, shortages were rife...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>: The last truly great time period in history. Music, films, politicians were nice, clean and decent. There was a general optimistic feeling about the future, exemplified in sunny fashions, interiors and technology. The youth enjoyed some great rock 'n' roll on their transistor radios and the early TV shows show how happy and pleased everybody was. Not taken in account: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a>, anti-communist witch hunts, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a>, the French Indochina War, many European countries tried violently oppressing the inevitable independence of their colonies, Afro-Americans were still second-rate citizens in the USA and had to fight for human rights, homosexuals were forced to keep their sexual identity silent in many countries, the traditional role of women as housewives was still encouraged in many Western countries, a lot of music in the hit parade was still the bland, square, formulaic and sappy crooner music popular since the 20s, adults were scared of early rock 'n' roll and actually did everything to suppress the youth from listening to it and becoming teenage delinquents, the TV shows and films of that decade were so escapist that they ignored every controversial element.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, a great time when everybody was a beatnik or a hippie and enjoyed fantastic rock music, marijuana, LSD and free love. People chased bad guys with their own hands with cool funk and disco music playing in the background. The young demonstrated for more democratic rights and everything changed for the better. Not taken in account: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenerationGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGenerationGap">older generation looked down upon hippies</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a> cost many lives, The Cuba Missile Crisis nearly caused a nuclear war between the USA and USSR, Afro-Americans still had to fight for civil rights, just like today there were just as much idealistic but naïve demonstrators who merely wasted time smoking pot instead of actually doing something, drug casualties were just as rampant back then as they are today, people took the law on their hands because of the alarming crime rates, not helped by the extreme corruption of police forces, psychedelic rock, funk and disco are now confined to sit in the shadow of both rock-and-roll and modern pop music, to the point that for decades, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDisco">these were considered as the most cheesy genres created by man</a>, not all demonstrators were pacifistic in their approach and it's an open question whether everything actually changed for the better.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>: Oh yes. A great decade for pop culture after the sordid '70s and before everything went to the gutter in the '90s: Everybody felt a bright future coming along, as demonstrated by good TV shows, groundbreaking technology, computers and videogames, colorful clothing, simple yet catchy pop music and finally a TV channel that showed your favorite bands 24/7. The Cold War came to an end, the Berlin Wall and Apartheid fell. Not taken in account: The early 1980s had many people fear the Cold War wasn't going to end well. The Latin American debt crisis. President Reagan wanted more nuclear missiles in Europe, envisioned the Star Wars defense system and the "Evil Empire" speech reflected the "Red Scare" at a time "the Bomb" was still making everybody nervous. The Cold War, Berlin Wall and Apartheid did fall, but only near the end of the decade. Unemployment and economic crisis were a huge problem in many Western countries in the early years of the decade and the high speculation led to a bubble which fatigued in 1987 and burst in 1989. AIDS caused many victims because governments were slow to inform the general public on this disease as most people at first dismissed as <em>just</em> a problem for blacks, gays and drug users. TV shows and movies were extremely escapist and PCs and video games were prohibitively expensive. MTV did bring music videos on TV, but the downside was that how a pop star looked and danced became more important than the music, which was now created by computers, becoming increasingly sappy and repetitive as samples became the norm, becoming a disadvantage for those who still wanted to use actual instruments, chords and tunes. Metal and rap were seen as crime-mongering and even "satanic" as a whole. Also drugs went artificial during this time, turning Florida into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine World</a>. The nuclear power plant explosion in Chernobyl caused another major fear among people about the dangers of nuclear power.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAughts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAughts">The Aughts</a>: Dude. The Cold War has ended, and though some pesky Arabs (and some nutcases in the West) will try to blow people up and some Central European countries will be at each other's throats, there is peace at last! Outsourcing has lifted the West from the heavy load of manual work for good and turn to technology, plus, isn't the Internet wonderful? Society and culture are now free to break all imposed boundaries: Music has become more authentic with the arrival of rap, hip-hop, grunge and pop-punk. TV and movies now address modern issues instead of being stuck in those stodgy 50s and 60s. Politicians at last agree on stuff and generally get along. Whatever. Not taken in account: While a couple of years in the late 1990s were quite peaceful, the years before were marked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheYugoslavWars">the extremely chaotic rearrangement of the former Warsaw Pact nations</a> and the decade after was dominated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">the Iraq War and memories of 9/11</a>. The "technological revolution" ultimately never became the boon it was supposed to be: Economically, the exodus of manufacturing jobs forced the middle class to live in debt, which would give way to an economic meltdown by the end of the 2000s while privacy would gradually become a major source of concern as personal data became readily accessible. During the 1990s, the Internet was very expensive and was the province of businessmen and geeks while during the following decade, online downloads and chatrooms became incendiary topics. Grunge and "gangsta rap" were better known at their peak for the demise of several of their stars than for the music while hip-hop and pop-punk would be regarded in retrospective as trashy as the bubblegum pop that dominated the late 90s. By increasingly appealing to the trendy set, TV and film became increasingly shallow. While ideological differences became a thing of the past, politics became more self-serving and conflicts became pettier. As a result, people began to feel a sense of disconnection, which eventually led to the rise of strongly ideological populist movements.
</li></ul></li><li> The '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAgeEurope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAgeEurope">Dark Ages</a>' are still seen as a bleak and decrepit period where human advancement stopped dead... despite the fact that there is no evidence for this and historians have considered the idea bunkum for around <em>eighty years</em>. The reason we think of them as the dark ages at all? Nostalgia inspired by the grand works of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The idea that the Church suppressed learning? While it's true that a lot of stuff that went against the Church's teachings was considered blasphemous at the same time many monks actually preserved very many Pagan writings and ideas and encouraged literacy (among other things).
<ul><li> Note also another idea central to the 'Dark Ages' being a block to 'human advancement' - that Europe was inevitably going to lead the world into the industrial era. Not because a centuries-long, highly complex tale of economic factor forces saw investments in instruments and mechanisation which almost accidentally led to unprecedented scientific breakthroughs (encouraged by rising labour costs, the result of mass-migration to the New World at a time when north Europe's regional economies were growing). Not because of conflicts, political intrigue and social trends (along unforeseen events like the Black Death or the Fall of Constantinople) further encouraging the environment that made the Renaissance possible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics">but because the innate superiority of Christian European civilisation made it inevitable.</a>
</li><li> Made worse by elementary schools' equating of "Middle Ages" (a period of roughly 1000 years) with "Dark Ages" (the first few centuries of this period, called "Dark" because there is proportionally little written information compared to earlier and later periods).
</li></ul></li><li> Almost ubiquitous in the message of political "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">culture warriors</a>": apparently, the arrival of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> is roughly when either (a) everything worthwhile started, or (b) it all went to hell.
</li><li> As noted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Phonogram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Phonogram">Phonogram</a></em> example above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britpop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Britpop">Britpop</a> curmudgeon Luke Haines is famous for decrying nostalgia in all its forms, because of the way it warps people's perceptions of things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHagakure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHagakure">The Hagakure</a></em>, by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">notes the futility of nostalgia</a>, saying that it's necessary to make the best out of each generation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">However,</a> Yamamoto not only claims that the good old days were actually better, he notes that each generation is less than the one before it because the world is coming to an end.
</li><li> With crime rates declining in the US, some criminals have begun pining for the good old days. In the words of one former crack dealer: "These few blocks here were the murder capital of the world, and right here's where I did my business. Made a lot of money too. Even sold it down by the White House. Could do anything back then. We owned this city. Now it's like everywhere else. One giant coffee shop."
<ul><li> Speaking of crime rates, crime has steadily decreased in America over the past few decades, but a large percentage of people are convinced that crime has risen to out of control levels. The rise of the 24-hour news cycle is probably at least partially to blame.
<ul><li> Despite the belief that they're a recent phenomenon, mass shootings (and persons killed in mass shootings) in the US peaked in the 1930s, the golden age of violent bank robbers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> by many pages on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> claiming "Only a <em>real</em> nineties kid would remember X" (where "X" is something nostalgic to the era, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">regardless of when it actually originated</a>) or that "If you were born in the years 1990-1999 you're in the last generation with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge">common sense.</a></em>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Ignoring the fact that in 2013, if you were born after</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">you are thirteen at the oldest,</a> this is probably the most confusing example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">No True Scotsman</a> ever.
</li><li> This New York Times <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/31/arts/music/31sann.html">article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> discusses "rockism", which is the common belief that rock music is more "authentic" than other genres. It basically says that many critics have an idealized version of the heyday of rock music and rock stars that never actually existed, which they then compare unrelated genres such as hip-hop or electronica to.
<ul><li> Something related to this is the idea that metal is more manly than other genres, which is largely based on the image it represents, not the demographic it appeals to (often socially awkward people who think listening to it makes them tough).
</li></ul></li><li> Much of the popularity of pixel art and chiptunes stems from the nostalgia of 8-bit video games.
</li><li> Invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAcaciaStrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAcaciaStrain">Vincent Bennett</a> with younger musicians who have cited various lower-level acts that Vincent either played shows with or was aware of in the early days of The Acacia Strain as long-lost classics, as Vincent has gone on record to state that he couldn't relate to their sentiment, as he never liked those acts or thought they were any good. As far as Vincent is concerned, they may see it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a>, while he still sees those acts as third-tier bands that often never went anywhere for a reason.
