<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Hot Stuff- Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<p>The hot foods we're most familiar with are mostly from three groups — the Brassicas (cabbage, turnips, radishes and relatives), the Capsicums (chile peppers, related to tomatoes, potatoes, and nightshade in the Solanaceae family), and the Piperaceae (black pepper and a couple of exotic relatives like long pepper and cubeb). (There's also spices like cinnamon and ginger, but except for things like cinnamon candy, they're better known for their overall flavor than just the heat.)
</p><ul><li> Many types of hot peppers, particularly the species <em>Capsicum chinense</em> and hybrids thereof. The most notable of these are the Habanero and the Scotch Bonnet; the average C. chinense is a tiny round thing with a festive orange color that looks quite harmless, but causes really severe pain to the unprepared (like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ip5oGlMfU">this guy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). You need to build up a serious capsaicin tolerance before you can appreciate the delicious smoky/citrusy taste (hence why habanero and lemon, lime, or orange are such classic cooking combinations, as well as habanero with seasonings and other ingredients that go well with citrus like rosemary, ginger, and mango).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0sg0x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0sg0x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0sg0x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For those who just don't appreciate the sheer joy of capsaicin-receptor torture, plant breeders have also created heatless habaneros for those who just want the flavor. They aren't as rare as you might think.</span>
</li><li> There's one type of hot pepper called the Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Chili) that can make you go temporarily deaf by sheer heat. It <em>was</em> ranked by Guinness Books as the hottest pepper in the world at 850,000 - 1,050,000 Scoville Heat Units. The only things known to be hotter are pure capsaicin, some of its derivatives and military/police grade pepper spray (which isn't actually <em>that</em> much hotter, just a few times). It is used for many things, including treating stomach ills, and the juice, when smeared on fences or added to smoke bombs, is potent enough to drive elephants away. (And it's been outdone by a variant of a variety called the Trinidad Scorpion, since outdone in turn by the Carolina Reaper and then the Dragon's Breath.) That said, increasing heat tolerance means jalapenos and tabascos and even habaneros are now making way for these heat bombs. Buffalo Wild Wings now uses <em>ghost peppers</em> as the base for its hottest sauces.
<ul><li> Note that if you seriously intend to eat one of these peppers you should check to make sure you don't have gastric or esophageal ulcers, GERD, Barrett's esophagus, family or personal history of esophageal or gastric cancer, or other internal cuts; the amount of raw, concentrated capsaicin can actually kill you if it hits your bloodstream without being diluted. Check out <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/F9zB8O6HdeE">this video of a pepper aficionado<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> deciding to eat 100 Carolina Reapers in one sitting. It sent him to the emergency room because he was <em>vomiting blood</em>.
</li><li> Also worth noting is that the Bhut Jolokia and onwards cannot be handled with your bare hands. Unlike other types of chili peppers, the capsaicin permeates the entire fruit and not just the parts around the seeds. In India, where the Bhut Jolokia was bred, the peppers are rubbed onto fences and trees to permeate the air with capsaicin and repel elephants. The capsaicin will hook onto your skin if you touch it and will corrode your skin if you don't dissolve it away. People typically handle them with latex gloves, and even then, they will burn through the gloves after about 30 minutes of contact.
</li><li> Oh, and check for any history of blood flow problems in your brain. That much capsaicin ingested in once can cause a condition called reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS); essentially the blood vessels in the brain temporarily constrict, causing symptoms like "thunderclap" headaches. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43699484">This happened to a guy after eating a Carolina Reaper.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Two further cultivars of <em>Capsicum</em>, the Dragon's Breath pepper and "Pepper X" have been ranked at 2.48 million and 3.18 million Scoville units, and according to legend, both of them contain potentially lethal amounts of capsaicin. However, the Dragon's Breath pepper has another purpose besides culinary: scientists believe its essential oil can be used to make more effective anesthetics.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note187yn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note187yn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note187yn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BlazingInfernoHellfireSauce/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/BlazingInfernoHellfireSauce/RealLife">You can read about it here</a>, but basically capsaicin's natural affinity for pain also makes it useful in <em>relieving</em> it. Half of the crops from the Dragon's Breath are earmarked for medical research.</span>
</li><li> Paqui Tortilla Chips offers the One-Chip Challenge, wherein courageous pepperheads must eat one tortilla chip (as in, that's all the package contains) flavored with Carolina Reaper, Scorpion Pepper, and Sichuan Peppercorn, and then endure the burn without tapping out by eating or drinking anything else. Both the website and store displays feature a disclaimer warning people of the potential medical complications from eating said chip, including keeping it away from children and pregnant women.
</li></ul></li><li> If you don't just want to take a bite of a super-hot pepper but want to try a super-hot <em>full meal</em>, then British-Asian cuisine is the place to be. Specifically the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phall">phall.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It's basically just bits of chicken/ lamb/ beef/ whatever drowned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlazingInfernoHellfireSauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlazingInfernoHellfireSauce">Blazing Inferno Hellfire Sauce</a> with some lost tomatoes. Have a glass of milk handy or a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lassi">lassi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Even beer won't do any good, and water might even make things worse.
<ul><li> Capsaicin is soluble in fat and alcohol, but not water. Sadly, most beer is less than 10% alcohol so won't take away that much of the spice compared to, say, swishing a shot of the hard stuff in your mouth or even using mouthwash. Mind you, most curries wow you with the chili, to then mug you with the ginger, mustard and black pepper when you've got complacent. So... yeah: milk covers all bases.
</li><li> First hand experience: you're better off with the full-fat dairy than the beer — more fat. And, with a phall, you <em>need</em> that fat. You <em>could</em> get away with a beer and a vindaloo or downwards in the curry-heat stakes, though (depending on your taste buds' abilities at survival). Yup: mitigating the pain is as much of an art-form as creating it in the first place. Sweet can also help, if mixed in with the fat, as it gives the mouth a different flavour to latch onto in its desperation. You're a bit screwed, however, if you're going for one of the hot ones that already contains cream, yoghurt and almonds along with the ghee, though, as the chili is already quite at home with the fat. British-Asian cuisine: pick your pain and your medicine wisely.
</li><li> One restaurant in New York City serves phall so hot, the chef wears a gas mask to cook it, and before you eat it, you must sign a waiver freeing the restaurant from legal blame if you die. These acts are not part of some presentation to hype it up. That phall really is that dangerous.
</li><li> The above is a naga phall, and most British high streets have least one takeaway that has it either on the menu or by request. It's a phall made with naga chillies (bhut jolokia by another name) in some capacity, usually either fresh, smoked or pickled, rather than "just" scotch bonnets or habaneros. And, yes: masks and careful overalls and gloves are needed unless the chef has a death wish. <em>Anything</em> with "naga" attached to the name means "ghost pepper added", whatever its strength; so, it can be a relitively tame naga dopiaza... or a not-very-tame one. There are even hotter curries than a naga phall available. "Rajastani", as it pertains to curry shops, is a term to step warily around, for one.
</li></ul></li><li> A restaurant chain in the US now serves "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaker_Steak_%26_Lube#Wing_sauce">triple atomic wings<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" for masochists to numb their mouths and clear their sinuses with.
<ul><li> A few other wing chains have challenges where one must <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaMealChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaMealChallenge">eat a pile of the spiciest wings in the house in a certain amount of time</a>, with people able to do it photographed and put on a wall, maybe even given an "I survived" T-shirt.
</li></ul></li><li> Wasabi. There are several very good reasons why it is recommended that one use only a dab of wasabi sauce on your sushi, and the ones that don't involve flailing around in pain like an idiot have to do with the subsequent volcanic trip to the bathroom.
<ul><li> Horseradish as well. Wasabi is frequently cut with or imitated by green-dyed horseradish — though the wasabi plant is not in the same genus as true horseradish — and in Japan horseradish is known as "Western wasabi".
<ul><li> It depends on what classification you use. Some botanists put them both into genus <em>Cochlearia</em>. Still they are both in the cabbage family, <em>Brassicaceae</em>, and are similar enough in biology and taste.
</li></ul></li><li> On the other hand, wasabi is also a very clean spice. Unlike the things listed above, it doesn't really linger or taste 'hot', as the compounds that give wasabi and horseradish their hotness are water-soluble and do not cling to your mouth as capsaicin does.
<ul><li> A good analogy is that the spice of wasabi is like a flammable gas: a quick explosion of heat, but fades quickly. Peppers are like burning wood or other flammable materials like that: a slower, steadier burn. The stronger peppers could be compared to thermite: Very strong, and there's almost no chance of stopping it once it's started (like how it's hard to cool a mouth that's suffered something blisteringly spicy.)
</li></ul></li><li> A nasty trait of wasabi that most other spicy foods don't have is that when you swallow it, some of the spicy molecules may float up into your sinuses and cause you to feel like your nose is burning deep within. Luckily this only lasts for a few seconds, but it is <em>really</em> painful while it lasts.
</li></ul></li><li> Chimpanzees will sometimes deliberately seek out and eat fire ants, which bite. Gustatory masochism must be a common trait of the tribe <em>Hominini</em>.
</li><li> Birds are immune to the effect of capsaicin, they can therefore eat all forms of hot peppers without ill effect. This is the point of capsaicin since peppers spread their seeds far and wide through the droppings of birds that eat them and would be digested too much if a mammal ate their fruit instead. Hence some varieties of bird suet have capsaicin mixed in and some stores sell seeds coated in it to deter squirrels from raiding bird feeders.
</li><li> Russian mustard, or rather anything with black mustard seeds. It's more or less the Jalapeno of mustards.
<ul><li> Same goes for Estonian mustard, especially Põltsamaa brand. Swedish mustard is very mild, and many unsuspecting Swedes have tasted Põltsamaa with obvious results.
</li></ul></li><li> People used to American mustard should approach the British version, which is exactly the same colour, with caution. Brits tend to find American mustard blandly insipid, and with good reason. The standard English table mustard is overpoweringly strong to those who are not used to it. French's Classic - it ain't. And many British people will still buy powdered mustard, and make it up into a paste to suit their taste. <em>It can make you feel like your <strong>ears</strong> (yes, your ears) are on fire.</em> You have been advised.
</li><li> Raw garlic. A powerful taste that can painfully burn your mouth for several seconds, possibly give you an upset stomach if you eat enough, and curse you with a stench that not only taints your breath but your actual body odor as well. That's not going to stop some people from chowing down on a few cloves a day. Justified, as studies have suggested that eating raw garlic has health benefits. On the "folk remedy" side of things, garlic has been used as both food and medicine in many cultures for thousands of years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">dating at least as far back</a> as when the Giza pyramids were built. Russians are also fond of this one, and of equally hot snacks made from raw garlic and cheese In some parts of China, a piece of it is eaten with dumplings.
<ul><li> Garlic is also an natural Antibiotic, very useful for curing toothaches. This is done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">soaking a towel in hot water mixed with chopped raw garlic and leaving the hellish mass of pain in your mouth next to the already painful toothache</a>. It works.
</li><li> Another benefit of having a diet rich in garlic: A garlic-eater's body-odor acts as a natural mosquito repellant.
</li><li> To get the full benefit of Raw Garlic, you can't just chop it up and cook a bit of it in your meals, but have to chow down on whole, peeled and uncooked cloves. Multiple times a day. The reason is that Garlic only releases those chemicals as a biological deterrent to being crushed and cooking it causes the chemicals in it to react and change into something completely different. This is also why when you dice garlic, you usually have to crush it first.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a>-based Japanese fusion restaurant <a class="urllink" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/on-the-bridge-san-francisco">On The Bridge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has spice levels that are as follows: Mild, Medium, Spicy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">X-Spicy, XX-Spicy, XXX-Spicy, and XXXX-Spicy</a>. Casual customers have been known to reach their limit at XX or XXX level. However, there are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">"secret" spicy levels that go beyond XXXX-Spicy</a>, the catch being that <em>the chef has to know you personally</em> before he'll let you try them. There are reports of people having done as high as <em>20X</em>-spicy.
</li><li> Salmiakki. This stuff is especially loved in Finland, and it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat">ammonium chloride</a> mixed with liquorice. The taste is simultaneously sour, fiery and sweet, and ingesting ammonium chloride will accelerate salivation.

<ul><li> In Finnish colloquial, the word <em>salmiakki</em> refers also to ammonium chloride compound itself, not only to the candy made from it, because "salmiakki" is a Finnish take on the Late Latin term <em>sal ammoniac</em>, that is, "Salt of Amun", a somewhat rare mineral which is almost pure ammonium chloride.

<p><span class="asscaps">Cheese and Other Dairy</span>
</p><ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_marzu">Casu Marzu,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a Sardinian delicacy. The cheese gets its unique flavour and odour from the <em>live maggots</em> that inhabit it, but you have to be careful when eating it because said larvae are known to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">jump into the eyes of diners or live on in their intestines as parasites.</a> Apparently, the best way to eat it is to put it into a paper bag or similar item to suffocate and kill the larvae inside, and then <em>quickly</em> consume it before the larva corpses become toxic.
<ul><li> For a short time, Casu Marzu was banned in Sardinia due to the intestinal parasites. As more than one comic quipped, why would you ban something in the only place where people are crazy enough to eat it?
</li></ul></li><li> At first glance, the French Mimolette and German Milbenkäse are seemingly regular cheeses, albeit with unusual, crumbly crusts. Then you learn that the entire surface of both cheeses are actually covered in countless tiny <em>cheese mites</em>, and that their distinctive crusts are composed of these tiny organisms and their <em>moulted skin and feces</em>.
</li><li> It's almost impossible to get real kefir, a liquid dairy product, in the United States, as it contains so many (harmless) strains of living bacteria, fungi and protozoa that it's considered "contaminated" by FDA standards, even fresh from the vat. Biologists believe that such compound colonies of protozoa, that existed in the bacterial mats on early Earth, were predecessors of all multicell organisms. Genuine kefir is <em>so</em> alive that the lumpy curds it's derived from not only grow larger inside those vats, but actually split in two as they grow due to agitation of the liquid.
</li><li> From the British Isles, we have Stilton, a type of cheese that is REQUIRED to be moldy. This isn't specific to Stilton, it's true of 'most all "blue" cheeses, meaning Roquefort and Gorgonzola are in the same boat. And these aren't the only moldy cheeses. Certain kinds of cheeses allow benign mold to grow on the rind and gradually age the cheese from the outside in.
</li><li> In fact, many cheeses employ microorganisms to impart certain qualities to the cheese as they age. Many cheeses known for their distinctive smell (like limburger) become that way due to being regularly washed in a bacterial culture that then feeds on the proto-cheese and alters its composition. But in terms of disgust, most cheeses have nothing on the likes of mimolette, which intentionally lets <em>mites</em> eat into the rind to flavor it.
</li><li> Bog Butter: lumps of butter or lard/tallow sometimes found in peat bogs, mainly around historical Celtic areas like Scotland or Ireland, with dates ranging from Bronze Age to the late Medieval times. Some of them lack any packaging and are clearly intended as offering to gods, while others are carefully wrapped in cloth or straw and packed into insulated wooden containers or even genuine barrels, and show all the signs of planned retrieval and consumption. Fats, as a very nutritious and somewhat rare food was very valuable in the ancient times, and the cold temperature and acidic water of peat bogs helped to conserve it. While the short-term storage changed the product very little, the prolonged storage essentially aged the butter into a sort of very rich cheese, which is an acquired taste, but is still edible even after centuries-long aging: some gutsy archeologists have even tasted the ancient specimens along with the modern recreations.
<ul><li> A modern cousin to the bog butter still lives in the Maghreb: in Berber cuisine, a salted clarified butter called smen is spiced with thyme and packed into clay jars that are then buried into the ground to ferment and age it. Like the bog butter, a properly aged smen is said to taste like an old, sharp cheese, and there is a custom to start ajar of smen on a birth of a daughter to be consumed on her wedding.
</li></ul></li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Creepy Crawlies</span>
</p><ul><li> There is a specialty restaurant in New York where people pay through the nose to eat such things as deep-fried tarantula. You can also roast them, apparently, together with other delicious creatures, like cockroaches and centipedes among others...
</li><li> People have been known to eat live scorpions. Yes, live as in "still got the poisonous stinger".
</li><li> In Cambodia, certain villages started eating tarantulas under the Khmer Rouge regime due to famine. They got used to it and still eat them. Arachnovores of the world, unite.
</li><li> The Chinese, being averse to waste, have a traditional treat in the Northwest: Fried silkworm pupae. They're sold alive and wiggling their back ends and served stir-fried or deep-fried. Taste is actually quite nice, being reiniscent of cooked sunflower seeds. The trick is to pinch the tail, removing the insect, and slurp the white goo inside.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Fish</span>
</p><ul><li> Fugu, or Japanese blowfish, carries tetrodotoxin (TTX, one of the most potent neurotoxin in the world) in their skin and internal organs. Death by TTX is extremely nasty: rapid full-body paralysis followed by slow asphyxiation, and the patient remains conscious throughout the ordeal; there is no known antidote and the treatment consists of helping the paralyzed victim get oxygen while waiting for his/her body to process the toxin (one wonders how they discovered which bits were safe to eat). Aspiring fugu chefs must take a 3-year course, and the final exam requires the students to prepare a plate of fugu, then <em>eat</em> it. Only 30% of applicants pass (most of them fail the written portion, EMS is on hand to take care of everyone else). Averted nowadays, as most Japanese restaurants serve farm-raised fugu, whose diet does not contain the poisonous stuff wild fugu eat to get so screamingly toxic. The finished dish is then sprinkled with a <em>very</em> small amount of highly diluted bottled toxin to get the tingly/numb lips and tongue (if the numbness spreads past your neck, go to the nearest emergency room as fast as your and your friend's legs can carry you).
<ul><li> Fugu is supposed to have a narcotic effect. Apparently it's good enough to be worth the risk of waking up in your own grave (the active ingredient is a key component in the zombification process - really, no kidding). What some people will go through just to catch a buzz.
</li><li> A famous Japanese actor once killed himself after eating four fugu livers, the most poisonous part of the fish, on a dare. Not at the same time, <em>four separate times</em> in his life.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2gde8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2gde8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2gde8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The chef who served him was later charged with his death, despite having outright told the actor that it's a stupid idea. The reason he served the actor anyways was because, due the actor being considered a National Treasure, the chef could not refuse an order from him no matter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">how suicidally stupid</a> it was.</span> Similarly, hobos are known to accidentally ingest it after digging through the trash of restaurants. This is why serving fugu liver is illegal in Japan and why it's considered <em>biohazardous material</em> which must be properly disposed of.
</li><li> The Emperor of Japan is specifically forbidden from eating Fugu. At least <a class="urllink" href="http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-japan-blowfish1-2009apr01-story.html">one chef<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> feels that it would be quite safe for him to try, and help get rid of the negative "stereotype".
</li><li> The <em>Munchkin</em> Expansion <em>Munchkin Fu</em> has the Fugu card. It gives you a level up... 5/6 of the time. Otherwise, it kills you stone dead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Lutefisk</em>, from Scandinavia. Essentially, you take a perfectly good fish, dry it thoroughly until it resembles a 2x4 plank, and let it rot slightly, then soak it in lye and smoke it. Then, you soak it in water to get all the lye out, boil it, and serve it with innocent mashed potatoes which had done nothing to deserve the treatment. The resulting substance often tastes like a science experiment gone tragically wrong. According to some, the <em>best</em> lutefisk is the kind that can <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteTheSpoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AteTheSpoon">dissolve the silverware used to eat it</a></em>!
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_14979_the-6-most-terrifying-foods-in-world.html">Cracked<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:</strong> For those of you who don't know, lye (potassium hydroxide/sodium hydroxide) is a powerful industrial chemical used for cleaning drains, killing plants, de-budding cow horns, powering batteries, and manufacturing biodiesel. Contact with lye can cause chemical burns, permanent scarring, blindness or total deliciousness, depending on whether you pour it onto a herring or your own face.
</div><ul><li> Lye is a strong base, so it won't attack silver, but it can cause damage to nickel-based alloys.
</li><li> Eating lutefisk is something of a rite of passage for people who live in Minnesota (which, of course, is largely populated by people of Scandanavian descent). Legends of its origins vary from "way to eat fish that had been stored outdoors" to "food intended as a deliberate poison given by St. Patrick to Viking raiders that was declared a delicacy after they ate and loved it."
</li><li> Properly made lutefisk <em>is</em> delicious, but the problem is that the right amount of time to soak it in lye is in an <strong>extremely</strong> narrow range. Too little time, and it tastes hideous. Too long and the lye will turn the meat's <em>entire</em> fat-content into <strong>soap</strong>, because the way soap is usually made is by treating fats with lye.
</li><li> Finns prefer birchwood ash instead of lye as the softening agent. The advantage is that the base of the birchwood ash is potash rather than lye, and it is milder and won't attack the fish fats. Lutefisk prepared with potash usually will not have any rancid odour and the taste is rather pleasant. The risk of saponification (fish fats turning into soap in high pH environment) is minimal compared to lye treatment.
<ul><li> Potash and Lye can the same thing. You can completely saponify something with potash. Lye is just a generic name for metal hydroxides. Potash refers to potassium hydroxide. It is all akalai. However, what most people call lye is more precisely called caustic soda: <em>sodium</em> hydroxide, which can react differently than potash.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Surströmming, which is herring that has been fermented. Sold in tins that are <em>designed</em> to bend and warp, and (on some unfortunate occasions) occasionally <em>burst open</em>, from the gases released during the process. A polarising delicacy, as you either love it or more often, try to avoid it like the plague — quite literally, as a single tin can stink up a whole building (one person in Germany got <em>evicted</em> after the brine was spilled on a stairwell; he sued, and the landlord's defense was to simply open a can of it in the courtroom. The landlord won the case immediately). Most airlines explicitly ban passengers from bringing it aboard planes either as a carry-on or as checked luggage. Unsuspecting non-natives have been known to try to alert authorities about biohazards when presented with the dish for the first time.
<ul><li> The trick is to open the can under water, such as in a water bucket. The herring itself is not decomposed in the fermentation process as the proteins are not attacked by the bacteria. Jamie Oliver compares it to fish sauce, something that initially smells disgusting but is actually pretty good once you start eating it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A1karl">Hákarl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is an Icelandic meal made by gutting a Greenland or basking shark, burying it in the sand for 6-12 weeks, cutting it up, and hanging it out to dry for several months. It has a high ammonia content, stinks to high heaven, and will usually trigger a first-time eater's gag reflex. Not surprisingly, eating it is, to quote from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, "often associated with hardiness and strength." Mind you, the whole process is a necessary evil if you want to eat the sharks; they otherwise have too much urea in them to be edible.
</li><li> Russians are no slouches in the department of queasy fish, either. Vobla (basically roach fish mummified on the sun with intestines still in) is rather tame, as it only looks horrible. You eat it with your hands, with beer; eating the bladder, too, is a sign of badassery. Smoked Siberian omul is much worse, it emits an astonishingly strong smell of not exactly fresh fish and aggravates the innocent passengers of the Trans-Siberian rails to no end.
<ul><li> Russians are fond of salting and air-drying fish in general, and actually do this to <em>any</em> fish and/or seafood they encounter, and if the fish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">has fermented a little too well</a>, then what's a little smell among the friends. In fact, such foods have a distinctive name ("s dushkom", literally "with a litte smell"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3d8bo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3d8bo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3d8bo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though in fact the stink might be considerable, and even non-spoiled stuff is quite smelly</span>), and are considered a particular delicacy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">by some</a>.
</li><li> Actually, the many varieties of dried and/or salted fish are quite divisive in Russia. People would protest the smell and the mess that's created by eating that kind of delicacy, with small pieces of fish skin everywhere. Could go <em>very well</em> with beer, though.
</li></ul></li><li> Japanese have kusaya, a sort of a middle ground between the surströmming and hakarl, in that the fish is first salt-fermented like the former, and then air-dried like the latter. Even dried, it still stinks to the high heaven, thus the name, but the taste is quite agreeable, much like the Russian example above.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongeo-hoe">Hongeo-hoe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is fermented skate from the southern coast of Korea. Skates secrete uric acid through the skin instead of urinating, and like Hákarl, needs to be fermented to be (barely) edible. Its odour has been described as being "like a public outhouse".
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Military Rations</span>
</p><p>Feeding large armies in the field has led to some rather creative and unique solutions over the centuries:
</p><p></p><ul><li> Hardtack: An incredibly dense and hard form of bread, valued more for the fact that it will never go bad if kept dry than for its edibility.
<ul><li> U.S. Civil War: The standard Civil War solution to consuming it was to whack it against a hard surface to knock <em>most</em> of the weevils out, then soaking it in your cup of coffee to soften it up enough to chew. Still consumed in a few places a long way away from regular resupply. Taste-wise, though, it isn't so much <em>bad</em> as it is <em>bland.</em> Think of a biscuit or cookie made out of unsalted hard pretzel dough and you'll have an idea of what it tastes like.
</li><li> Finland: Hardtack bread belongs to the daily diet of the Finnish Armed Forces. The usual slang name is <em>vaneri</em> (literally "veneer" or "plywood"), with mess halls called <em>Valtion vanerimurskaamo</em> (State Plywood Crushery). Incredibly, many conscripts actually develop a taste for it.
</li><li> The D Ration Bar is essentially the modern warfare equivalent of hardtack. It was essentially a chocolate bar designed to be heat resistant and extremely dense, so that it would be viable for any type of climate as well as being extremely compact yet high in calories so that it could serve as a meal substitute in emergencies (the soldier was only expected to eat it for maybe 2-3 days; afterwards it's expected he'd at least get something like a K-ration, the period equivalent of an MRE). However, to prevent troops from snacking on it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4o60k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4o60k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4o60k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The thing has enough calories to account for a full meal and was only to be used to stave off starvation</span>, the colonel who requested it asked for it to taste "slightly better than a boiled potato". This, combined with the fact that most soldiers couldn't even chew it (some had to shave off bits with a knife and eat the shavings), meant that they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">rather starve than eat the damn thing</a>. Later iterations of the bar recognized this problem and were made slightly more palatable.
</li><li> Korea: Hardtack is such an integral part of Korean military life that combat uniform thigh pockets are called "hardtack pockets" because that's where soldiers keep their snacks. Not only is it a hardy way of providing fuel to soldiers, a lot of manufacturers include a small packet of candy in each packet of hardtack, meaning that soldiers have another treat to look forward to. And because military service in mandatory in Korea, hardtack has become a popular snack in general as a lot of men will seek it out because of the memories they associate with it and share it with their children.
</li><li> Russia: Traditionally, instead of baking special sort of bread, a normal loaves were sliced and baked/dried in the oven for the second time (just like some varieties of hardtack), resulting in diamond-hard croutons called <em>sukhari</em> (literally, "dries"). Later, shortly after the WWII, Soviet military switched to cracker-like "galety" mentioned below, because they were more palatable, and being canned in packaging similar to the small-arms ammo,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5da0x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5da0x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5da0x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The rifle, pistol and machinegun rounds in Soviet and Russian army are packed in large, zinc-plated, olive drab painted cans  called "zincs" for that  to protect them from elements</span> the shelf-life wasn't an issue anymore.
<ul><li> Around same time the <em>canned bread</em> was developed for submarine crews, because nothing could save the dried bread from soaking in the wet, dirty submarine air, resulting in swift spoilage, and baking fresh bread in the notoriously cramped diesel boats of the time was out of question. Again, the freshly baked loaves were taken out of the oven, <em>soaked in neutral spirits</em> to preserve them, and then packed into cans. Before serving, the cook would take the bread out of the can, reheat it in the special oven to boil off the alcohol, and serve it as if it was a normal freshly baked bread. Reportedly, the method worked perfectly, resulting in a product virtually indistinguishable from the normal bread, but sneaking the cans of alcohol-soaked bread from the storage after the mission became a favorite sailor feat and pastime, so the later, larger boats— especially nuclear ones with their much larger living spaces and energy budgets, not to mention several dedicated cooks (including a baker)— had normal bread ovens instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Other: Hardtack is still a mainstay of many a combat ration around the world, though the modern versions, like Japanese <em>kanpan</em> or Russian <em>galety</em>, are made with salt and shortening, making them basically indistinguishable from the normal crackers, and thus much more palatable. This is possible as the modern packaging<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6mq6g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6mq6g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6mq6g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They are packed into airtight pouches or cans filled with nitrogen, which prevents the oxidation and thus rancidity of fats in them.</span> allows these much richer crackers to be kept almost as long as the simple hardtack of the past.
</li></ul></li><li> MRE's: The distant successor of Hardtack is the Meal, Ready to Eat (MRE) series of meals, the combat ration of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">U.S. Armed Forces</a>. Keeps for years and can be prepared in 15 minutes by literally just adding water, which reacts with the heating element to cook the pouch of food. On the downside, it's notorious for being extremely dry and even causing constipation (a common joke in the American services is that "MRE" stands for "Meal, Refusing to Exit", and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken">Al Franken</a>, on a USO tour in Iraq,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7x8d9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7x8d9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7x8d9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Date unclear, but it was before he was a Senator</span> once joked that of the five MREs he'd had, "none had found an exit strategy"). They see wide use in the military, where keeping up with one's nutritional needs on the go is a very high priority, but American civilians who really want to try them can easily purchase them at the local surplus store.
<ul><li> MREs are so dense-packed with calories, carbs, protein and other nutrients that a single meal has well over <em>1000 calories</em> in a relatively small amount of food. <a class="urllink" href="https://foodassets.com/info/why-do-we-not-recommend-mre.html">For the unprepared, it's like crapping bricks.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Flavor-wise, opinions on MREs vary from being actually pretty good to being completely terrible, but the original MREs were universally despised, leading to them acquiring the nickname "Meals Rejected by Everyone/the Enemy/Ethiopians" and various other e words. This got especially pronounced during the first Gulf War, when a shipping error led to ham MREs being accidentally sent to Saudi troops, who were, of course, Muslims. The nearest US force had to trade all their chicken and beef MREs to the Saudis, resulting in them being stuck eating nothing but ham MREs for weeks.
</li></ul></li><li> On the Canadian side of the border is the IMP. No, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImp">not that one</a>, it stands for "Individual Meal Pack", but imp meat might be an ingredient for all we know. They're effectively MREs in design and intent, albeit packaged in a little brown brick, with different meal options, and an utter lack of a heating pouch. For the most part they range from edible to decent, but God have pity on you and your ancestors if you're forced to eat <em>the "poutine"</em> which is this trope full-stop. It's telling enough that it's poutine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canadians don't want to eat</a>, but it's most commonly described by the troops as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">cold slugs drenched in brown mucus</a>.
</li><li> Cold-weather rations and some early Russian rations can be this for people not acclimated to extreme cold. Because when you're in cold conditions your body burns massive amounts of calories, these foods are almost universally (and quite literally) drenched in salt and fat. When used in the proper climate, these are rather tasty. Eating them in warm climates? Absolutely disgusting.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Fruits and Questionable Vegetables</span>
</p><ul><li> Cloves, a seasoning typically found in small quantities in Indian food; they are occasionally boiled whole in something to season it instead of powdered and added. Biting into a clove is easily enough to numb an area of your mouth entirely, which is why eugenol, the chemical that gives cloves their distinctive flavor, is frequently used as a topical painkiller and disinfectant in dentistry.
<ul><li> Not just Indian food. Whole cloves can be found in several traditional winter dishes in Germany as well, such as plum preserves (both simple home-canned fruit and a kind of marmelade made by slow-cooking the plums with several spices but not much sugar until you get a thick, brown mush to spread on bread) and red cabbage (cooked with vinegar, apples, raisins and cloves and used like cranberry sauce as a side-dish for festive poultry dinners). In both cases, you usually have to take care to spit the cloves out while eating, as there is no feasible way to strain them from the food before serving.
</li><li> Eugenol also makes a fine filler cement and root canal sealant when mixed with the zinc oxide. Remember that weird spicy-medicinal smell always hanging around dentists? It's the eugenol, usually used in its raw form  directly as a clove oil.
</li></ul></li><li> The durian fruit, known for its notoriously strong odor. So strong, in fact, that metro systems and hotels in Southeast Asia, where durians come from, are known for banning them. The fruit itself has a tough husk covered entirely with the kind of spikes that a cactus would envy. One must wonder how hungry someone must have been to say to himself "the inside of that spiky ball might contain something delicious."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8dthr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8dthr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8dthr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Orangutans apparently love them; maybe the human thought "Well, if <em>they</em> can eat it...!"</span> Though, for some people, it <em>is</em> delicious; its flavor has been described as "savory, sweet, and creamy all at once" and "having a hint of chives mixed with powdered sugar". Others have described it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">diced garlic and caramel poured into whipped cream</a>." The only inoffensive way to consume it is by eating a freeze-dried version, which keeps most of the taste, but loses the smell almost entirely, or durian flavored foods, such as ice cream, which have a much milder smell.

It's occasionally used in Japanese media as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockYuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockYuck">stock gross-out food</a>. Even the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a></em> used it twice as the theme ingredient. Both battles (one versus Michiba, the other versus Morimoto; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both prevailed</span>) featured challengers that were sticklers for tradition.
</li><li> Lemons. They are great for making a sweet drink and flavoring things, but you have to be pretty masochistic to eat a lemon by itself.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Alleged Eggs</span>
</p><ul><li> Balut, a boiled duck or chicken egg with a nearly-developed embryo inside. Although a popular snack in such countries as Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines, its unfamiliarity to most Westerners has made it a standard "gross-out" food challenge in such reality game shows as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearFactor">Fear Factor</a></em>. Unlike most examples, the dish itself is merely horrifying in concept and looks (its flavor is somewhere between a cooked egg and cooked chicken), but given what it is, it's actually not that much worse than the bird it would have become, and foreigners who can get past the aesthetics will enthusiastically eat it and ask for more.
</li><li> Century Eggs are another Chinese delicacy that often sends foreigners up a hill in revolt. It's an egg that has gone through a fermentation process in alkali that turns the entire egg black and the yolk into a gooey grey mush. Its taste is extremely pungent and polarizing; you either love it or will puke at the merest taste. This is due to the high amounts of iron within the egg (which, given the color, you wouldn't be blamed if you thought there was <em>only iron left</em> in it). The legend on how it's made isn't exactly pleasant either; the rumor is that it was invented by someone soaking eggs in <em>horse urine</em>, doubtless because of its strong ammonia smell.
<ul><li> In short, it's a Chinese answer to a Norwegian lutefisk, only made with eggs instead of a cod, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">similarly polarizing</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of urine, another type of weird Chinese egg is the "Young Boy Egg" (Or Virgin Boy Egg). It's made by boiling eggs in the <em>urine of 10 year old boys</em>. It's currently considered by UNESCO to be a cultural delicacy and also considered a type of folk medicine.

</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Miscellaneous</span>
</p><ul><li> Pufferfish don't thrive in the Baltic, but Finns have their own version of cuisinal Russian Roulette: the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromitra_esculenta">false morel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mushroom (<em>Gyromitra esculenta</em>). False morel is one of the three most lethally toxic mushrooms in the world (the other two are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">death cap and destroying angel</a>), but unlike those two, fortunately the poison can be extracted from false morels. The usual way to detoxify false morel is parboiling (boiling the mushrooms really fast and throwing the water away, repeating it at least three times), which will (hopefully) render the mushroom edible. Once detoxified, the mushroom itself is utterly delicious. <em>All</em> Finnish schoolchildren are taught how to prepare false morels and all false morels sold fresh in Finland are required by law to be supplied with a warning and preparation guide. Canned false morels have been already processed so they contain no poison. The poison of the false morel is gyromitrin, which will metabolize into highly toxic monomethyl hydrazine, known better as <em>rocket fuel</em>, which damages the central nervous system, liver and kidneys, and is probably carcinogenic too. Fortunately, only two Finns (both small children who accidentally ate raw false morel) are known to have died from gyromitrine poisoning during the 20th century, and none during the 21st.
<ul><li> Russians eat false morels, too, along with various other dubiously edible mushrooms. Poisonings occur regularly.
</li></ul></li><li> Many monks during the Middle Ages, in an attempt to make their food less pleasurable, would sprinkle various powders on it to make it bitter. At least one (who later became a saint) is known to have done this to an extent that another monk who tasted it was laid out for three days with nausea.
</li><li> Any place where you can choose what goes in what you want (as in a sandwich, milkshake, etc.) typically has a few disgusting options for the sake of it. An example being a milkshake with pickled beetroot and custard.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A4mmi">Mämmi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Finnish Easter delicacy. It is basically unleavened rye pudding. Its taste is simultaneously sour and sweet, and it is usually eaten with cream. Yet it looks <em>exactly</em> like human excrement.
<ul><li> It is also called poop pudding, not just because it looks like poop, but also because it helps your body with digestion.
</li></ul></li><li> Everything from <em><a class="urllink" href="http://theoldwolf.com/ccdesan/Banquet/Banquet.html">The Old Wolf's Banquet from Hell,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> from a certain point of view.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_attack_grill">Heart Attack Grill.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Not so much the taste so much as how disgustingly unhealthy their options are. Their options include fries cooked in pure lard, milkshakes made from butter fat, and more infamously, the "Quadruple Bypass" burger, a four-patty burger that easily tops <em>9,500 calories</em>, over four times the generally-recommended daily intake for most adults. Since their introduction, they've since gone up to the "<strong>Octuple</strong> Bypass" burger. The best part is, customers who weigh over 350 pounds and weigh in with staff get to eat a meal for free. And yes, people have suffered fatal heart attacks there.
</li><li> Stinky tofu, popular in parts of China, lives up to its name. It smells like concentrated sewage mixed with vomit, and you can usually smell if a street stall is frying it from several blocks away. The proper fermentation process takes months, and enterprising street vendors have been known to take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAteWhat">shortcuts...</a> Notable in that stinky tofu proved to be the one food too unpalatable for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BizarreFoodsWithAndrewZimmern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BizarreFoodsWithAndrewZimmern">Andrew Zimmern</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Spartan</a> black soup. There is a famous case of a person from an Italian colony (these had a reputation for being rich and spoiled) tasting it and saying "now I know why Spartans don't give a damn about dying in battle". The Spartans, from their side, claimed that it's quite edible if you live like a man — that is, exercise like a Spartan and swim in ice-cold rivers. Unsurprisingly, no genuine recipe survived, though it's been known from description to contain, in addition to the pig's feet broth, the very same pig's blood, flavored with salt and vinegar, and fortified with chunks of stale bread, and, probably, lentils. No wonder that it was considered an acquired taste. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqQzWg9pXmg">Tasting History<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> tried to make a semi-authentic recipe, and considered it to be not exactly <em>terrible</em>, but probably not something you'll be itching to make when fall weather rolls around, either.
<ul><li> There are plenty of recipes from around the world that are basically a way not to waste the nutricious, but fast-spoiling blood of a just-slaughtered animal. And there are plenty of "bread soup" recipes designed to use up stale bread. It's just basic poor-people-food. Europe has various kinds of "blood sausage" (or "black pudding" in the British Isles), which is basically the same as described above, minus the lentils and vinegar, and likely replacing the bread with oats or similar, if it's mass-produced. And while the blood-and-grain mush is normally used as a sausage stuffing, there's a version from East German school meals that was served without the casing, resulting in something that looks exactly like a bad case of diarrhea. It was colloquially known as "Dead Granny". Though at least that dish was cooked. There's are several dishes in Southeast Asia that are based on congealed, raw blood. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>'s lengthy article on <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_as_food">blood as food<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Blood Tofu is not in fact blood-flavored tofu, but blood congealed with salt then cut into tofu blocks. Taste-wise, it is slightly milder than straight up blood with the texture of tofu. To those who don't know what it is, it might be palatable and interesting. Once they know what it is, 90% of the time the implication will cause them to gag. It is another one of those foods that is an acquired taste.
</li><li> Sour candy. While a lot of sour candy is pretty mild, some sour candies are so sour that they can mild burns on the tongue and mouth if too many are eaten at once and so have to have warnings on the box. Really strong sour candies are marketed with really scary names like Warheads or Toxic Waste.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia">Australian</a> conservationists, in an effort to further the battle against the dreaded cane toad, have actually been promoting the idea of people eating them; they even showed up in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BizarreFoodsWithAndrewZimmern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BizarreFoodsWithAndrewZimmern">Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern</a></em>. The reason this qualifies is, beyond the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockYuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockYuck">Stock "Yuck!"</a> of cooked frog's legs, cane toads are covered in toxin-secreting glands with a poisonous mucus so virulent that it can kill crocodiles, which is why the only predators in Australia that can eat them are meat ants, as invertebrates aren't affected by the toad's poison. (Yep, the little bastards are too toxic even for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandDownUnder">Land Down Under</a> — or more specifically, toxic in a way that Australia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">wasn't used to</a>, cane toads being invasive and all.) So, an improperly prepared dish of cooked cane toad can legitimately kill its diner, which has led the idea's original proponents to backpedal and persuade people to only eat meat from professionally butchered toads.
</li><li> Kuchikamizake is a Japanese alcoholic beverage that is made using human saliva. Rice is chewed up in a human mouth then spat out and left to ferment. In South America, a similar alcoholic drink named <em>chicha de muko</em>, which is prepared from chewed cassava or maize.
<ul><li> In fact, before koji mold (which can convert the starches in the rice into the sugars digestible to the yeasts) was discovered, <em>all</em> sake was produced that way: yeasts cannot digest starch as such, and needs some enzymes to break it into digestible sugars. In the beermaking, these enzymes are supplied by the malt, and in modern sake manufacturing by the koji mold, but before that people had to rely on the human saliva, which also has them. Note also that the chewed rice or corn is only a part of the whole grain bill, most of which contains of fresh (or steamed) grain.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of unintentional examples occurred in the book <em>Tales from a Forager's Kitchen,</em> written by Instagram star and food blogger Johna Holmgren. It was full of recipes containing raw ingredients that people quickly found were inedible, toxic, or just plain disgusting without being cooked, including morel mushrooms dipped in chocolate<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note103e8o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note103e8o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note103e8o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">eating raw morels can cause nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, not to mention the chance that readers might accidentally confuse them with false morels, which are toxic without exacting preparation, see above.</span>, a frozen elderberry smoothie<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ixcs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11ixcs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ixcs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">raw elderberries can make people sick</span>, a pumpkin soup recipe with raw acorns<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note122viy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note122viy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note122viy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which contain tannins, an extremely bitter and/or astringent chemical</span>, and a French toast recipe that suggested soaking wild rice, but not cooking it. As a result, the book was eventually recalled so people wouldn't try the recipes in it and get sick or die.
</li><li> Most pills taste absolutely horrible if bitten into. This is probably a good thing since you're not supposed to crush or chew pills in most cases, or eat more of them than you're supposed to.
</li><li> Kiviak may be one of the most disgusting sounding foods in the world. It is hundreds of small birds fermented whole for months inside of a dead seal, and then eaten raw by sucking out the birds' liquefied insides. People have died as a result of eating kiviak prepared using the wrong species of bird. The Inuit people of Greenland invented this so that they would have something to eat during the winter months when food is scarce. It tastes kind of like cheese.
</li><li> The Turkish flavor of culinary Russian Roulette is <em>deli bal</em>, which is honey made from the nectar of a particular species of rhododendron blossom, which contains Grayanotoxin, a neurotoxin that in small quantities is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">hallucinogenic</a>, thus earning this food its Anglophone nickname: <strong>Mad Honey</strong>.
</li><li> <em>Kimchi</em>, Korean pickled vegetables, can be quite off-putting to those not used to it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13w8c6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13w8c6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13w8c6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are many different types of <em>kimchi</em>. Some are very lighlty pickled while others are fermented for weeks or months to gain very strong flavors and odors.</span>. The most popularly known type, <em>baechu kimchi</em> (made using Chinese cabbage), smells overwhelmingly of garlic and chili powder. The odor will permeate everything in a refrigerator if <em>kimchi</em> is improperly stored or even render the appliance completely useless. For this reason, Korean companies sell dedicated kimchi refrigerators and regular refrigerators with a separate kimchi section below the fridge and freezer. Many people add <em>jeotgal</em> (fermented seafood like squid and oysters) when making <em>kimchi</em>, adding greatly to the pungency. And the smell only gets stronger as <em>kimchi</em> continues to ferment until it crosses the line from pickled to spoiled (the smell will go from sharp to sour). Non-Koreans who are more familiar with the lightly fermented <em>kimchi</em> served in restaurants or sold in non-Korean supermarkets may find themsevles overwhelmed when trying properly made <em>kimchi</em> for the first time.
</li><li> Marmite is a spread made from the yeast leftover from making beer mixed with a ton of salt and eaten on toast or crackers. There is a very good reason why they advertise it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveItOrHateIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveItOrHateIt">Love It or Hate It</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ASDFMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ASDFMovie">ASDF Movie</a></em> even did an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurProductSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurProductSucks">Our Product Sucks</a> advertisement for marmite that depicts marmite as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who does things like eating your pet pony and sleeping with your wife in front of you, which probably is what it makes you feel like it is doing when you taste it.

</p><ul><li> Tadashi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Onidere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Onidere">Onidere</a></em> is one of two people able to eat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Saya's</a> cooking. Every time someone tries it, there is a flashback to the worst pain they have ever endured, and then a multiplier. For Tadashi it was <em>30 times worse than stubbing his little toe as a child</em>. That was the first bite. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GargleBlaster">tea</a> served afterwards? <em>Five times worse than 'the entire meal</em>'.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, anything that England cooks is this, due to his preparation. The only character who can eat his food without suffering is America, since he grew up eating his food (he doesn't like it, however). Finland's food is also this, due to the ingredients such as salmiakki, and even his dog describes it as "poison".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Cologne</a> gets a hold of an order of Chinese noodles with an absolutely <em>horrific</em> taste (they managed to knock her, Shampoo, and Mousse out, they were so vile.) But she has crates and crates of the stuff, so, to get rid of it, the Cat Cafè holds a contest: she'll hide a mystical "noodle of strength" in a mountain of the rancid ones. Cue the egotistical martial artists in town (and a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a>) scarfing their way to the (quite literal) afterlife. Oh, and the strength-giving noodle? It tasted even <em>worse</em>. And it didn't work as advertised.
<ul><li> Again, when Ukyou was sick and Ranma, Akane, and Konatsu volunteered to tend to her restaurant, Akane's okonomiyaki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">were so gruesome</a> no one would eat them. Ranma is then inspired to hold a similar contest, with a prize going to whoever could finish their whole meal. Akane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">was not amused</a>.
</li><li> And <em>also</em> related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Akane</a>: after a whole saga involving her trying to get Ranma to eat her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">home-made cookies</a>, he finally takes them just to make her happy. He spends the next week bedridden. The several dozen incriminating photographs he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheEvidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheEvidence">disposed of</a> earlier probably didn't help.
</li><li> The very first time Akane's cooking entered the scene, Ranma and Genma retched and gagged, but didn't even call Akane out on it (yet) and instead just ran away. When Ryoga tasted it, he was visibly in <em>serious pain</em> but he kept grinning madly and eating it just for the joy of having Akane's cooking. In the original manga version, cue Ranma himself forcing himself to eat it just to prove to Akane that he liked it too (in other words, to prevent from being "shown up" by Ryoga). Needless to say, that was the last time in the series he would <em>dare</em> to try giving her cooking a chance, and otherwise would have to be forced to eat it.
</li></ul></li><li> A very <em>literal</em> masochist's meal is prepared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MM">MM!</a></em>, when Mio attempts to make squid ink pasta. (Key word: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">attempts</a>.</em>) The first to try it is Tarou, the masochist who enjoys <em>any</em> pain or discomfort inflicted on him by a girl. Naturally, he loves it. Then a couple other people try it...
</li><li> Some ingredients on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em> are even more dangerous to eat than they are to catch or prepare. In the "Gourmet Casino" arc, Toriko eats a Nitro Cherry and barely survives since it's like eating a lit stick of dynamite. And he only survived because he ate two other masochistic foods — the Dynami-Dragonfly, <em>another</em> explosive ingredient that reduces the effects of other explosives, and the Troll Cheese, whose foul odor messed up Toriko's super sense of smell so that he wouldn't succumb to the Nitro Cherry's fumes. Near the end of the arc, he eats a Poison Potato, the most poisonous food in the world, one that not even Coco can fully neutralize. Luckily for Toriko, the Poison Potato is compatible with his Gourmet Cells, so he gets a <em>powerup</em> instead of a nasty death.
</li><li> All food with the exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustHaveCaffeine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustHaveCaffeine">coffee</a> and water is this to the titular Ghouls of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>. It tastes incredibly vile to them, often causing them to become violently ill — tricks have been developed to pass for human by swallowing small bites <em>whole</em>, creating the illusion of eating without having to taste it. However, their bodies cannot digest the food and if they don't throw it up within a short period of time, it will make them seriously ill. Because her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBestFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBestFriend">Muggle Best Friend</a> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef">Supreme Chef</a>, Touka frequently forces down human meals for her friend and makes herself ill. On the other hand, Kaneki gives some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">horrifying</a> descriptions of what human food tastes like, often comparing it to rotting garbage or various inedible substances.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> includes a species of allegedly edible fish which taste terrible no matter what you do to try and prepare them.

</p><ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> books have several examples:
<ul><li> Dwarf bread is tremendously useful for surviving in the wilderness with, because if you have some on hand, you're always willing to find something else to eat. Like your own foot. This is because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndestructibleEdible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndestructibleEdible">dwarf bread is so hard</a>, it's of better use as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaguetteBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaguetteBeatdown">a blunt instrument</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Rincewind:</strong> "Dwarf bread?" <br/><strong>Mad:</strong> "Too right! That's what kept us going across thousands of miles of shark-infested ocean. If we hadn't had that sack of dwarf bread we'd" <br/><strong>Rincewind:</strong> "never have been able to club the sharks to death?" <br/><strong>Mad:</strong> "Ah, you're a man who knows your breads."
</div><ul><li> Apart from dwarf bread, dwarf cuisine consists of "what the dwarfs found underground — rats, snails, worms (useful protein), bits of stone and so on". Dwarfs are famed for their sauces, since no one would eat rat without something to hide the taste. In Ankh-Morpork, "fusion" cuisine aimed at humans is designed to <em>look</em> a bit like actual dwarf cookery, while being in a very real sense nothing like it.
</li><li> The <em>Compleat Discworld Atlas</em> introduces the related concept of Dwarf Chocolate, which takes a form suspiciously like a Toblerone bar and is described as being hard as concrete, taking the form of serrated teeth rising from a bar, and - worst - may contain nuts. It has been used as an impromptu weapon and as a means of extracting stubborn teeth. It is <em>technically</em> edible, in that it melts in your mouth. Eventually.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pyramids">Pyramids</a></em> there's a parody of fugu which contains a poison that, if not removed, causes the eater to expand like a blowfish and explode. It's traditionally served with roots that need to be prepared exactly over several days, or else they react catastrophically with stomach acid. This is described as 'fish and chips For Men'.
</li><li> This shows up again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em>, being used by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a>.
</li><li> Further <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> example: CMOT Dibbler's sausage-inna-bun. It's possible that the books exaggerate, but they're described as the culinary equivalent of a B-movie: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">they're absolutely awful, yet somehow appealing.</a>
</li><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastContinent">Fourecks</a> counterpart, Fair Go Dibbler, serves a meat pie floater. Apparently you have to be astonishingly drunk to consider eating one a good idea. In fact, all food served by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals">Dibblers</a> are like this, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Cut-Me-Own-Hand-Off Dhblah</a>'s disturbingly live yoghurt (he had to keep hitting it with a spoon to stop it escaping) to May-I-Be-Kicked-In-My-Own-Ice-Hole Dibooki's chunks of blubber (Rincewind reflects that it's one thing to butcher beached whales, and something else to just wait until they explode into bite-sized peices on their own).

When, finally, a rescue team can make it through the magic portal, the nannies sit in front of a crate of bananas, hoping to be able to open it, soon.

<ul><li> Well, maybe...it must be noted that "porcupine poisoning" doesn't <em>actually</em> happen to anyone in the book. Two characters <em>claim</em> that it happened to someone as part of a ruse. The whole scene reads like some finicky gourmet's preferences got mixed up with actual cautions, similar to those concerning fugu, to create an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> of epic proportions.
</li></ul></li></ul><p><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveActionTV">Live-Action TV</a></span>
</p><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> novel <em>Dragon's Honor</em> seems to take this to its logical extreme. Our intrepid crew is having dinner on a planet based on ancient China, and Picard's politeness regarding the local (hideous) cuisine bites him on the butt. The emperor orders the most elaborate dish possible. It hasn't been prepared in a hundred years, and it's an honor just to be part of the staff cooking it. It's a vile conglomeration of miscellaneous animal parts, mostly from venomous creatures. Picard has been eating stuff that makes fugu look palatable all night, and says that he can't eat it. Continuing to be dense, the emperor suspects that Picard may not want any because it was prepared wrong. He tosses a bit of it to a dog, who dies within seconds.
<ul><li> The dog died because the dish was poisoned on purpose, not because it was improperly prepared. But that wasn't why Picard refused to eat it. It's just that after all the other vile pieces of 'gourmet cuisine' he had consumed over the course of that wedding feast, he just couldn't bring himself to swallow something that smelled like a Klingon locker room.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> Klingon food and drink are often like this. Example: Gagh is unprocessed serpent worms, usually eaten live. The taste is revolting and it is eaten solely for the unique sensation of the gagh spasming in one's mouth and stomach in their death throes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>, Ezri implies that you're supposed to eat it whole, and alive. It's one thing she <em>doesn't</em> have in common with prior Dax hosts. Curzon and Jadzia were comfortable enough with Klingons and Klingon food. Ezri isn't; after recalling some of the more masochistic varieties, she had to excuse herself.
</li><li> In another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> novel, Riker becomes violently ill (to the point where he has to be beamed directly to sickbay) from having lunch with Worf and forgetting that some Klingon foods that are indigestible to humans (Dr. Crusher had given him a list). His reaction after being treated? "Bring on the next course."
<ul><li> Riker actually spent time with Klingons in the episode "A Matter of Honor", so he'd learned to stomach a number of Klingon foods and seemed to find it something worth experiencing.
</li></ul></li><li> Klingon tea is deadly to humans and not particularly good for Klingons. It's consumed in a ceremony with two or more participants as a test of courage and to show that "Death is an experience best shared". Thankfully for Dr. Katherine Pulaski, she is aware both of the poisonous nature of the tea leaves <em>and</em> what to take beforehand as an antidote.
</li><li> An interesting twist occured in one episode, where Riker tries to make omelettes from alien eggs, only to end up with the food declared horrid and inedible by his crewmates...except for Worf, who thanks to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a> is scarfing down his helping and enthusiastically asks for seconds.
</li><li> All of this leads up to an amusing inversion: when Worf tries prune juice for the first time, he declares it a "warrior's drink", and it becomes his standard drink order for the rest of his run on TNG and DS9. Someone on the writing staff must <em>really</em> hate prunes.

The octopus was meant to be eaten alive after its tentacles were bound, but the killer deliberately left them loose so the victim would choke on it.

Lister is a man who drinks vindaloo sauce for breakfast. It is said his shishkebabs require enough chilis to boost a small rocket into space. His chosen vindaloo becomes a weapon that slays space monsters and fells a tyrannosaur. When the <em>Starbug</em> runs out of all forms of curry, it precipitates a disaster that escalates until the course of human history is altered and the USA is destroyed as a world power. His crewmate Armold Rimmer once eats a Lister special sandwich (three fried eggs in strong vindaloo sauce) when drunk, and loves it. He regrets it later.

</li><li> The PVP revamp introduced "nailswurst", which is probably the closest thing on here to the page image, and "used beer". Yep. Neither of these gains you adventures, but they piss you off (giving you extra PVP fights.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> you can meet Chai Jin, an exotic chef. The dishes are revolting and downright damaging - depending on what you choose you'll hurt your body, mind or spirit - but if you sit through three courses of escalating grief to your system, you won't have to pay. You can then also try his newest meal, which is so horrid he won't even describe it, and which he hasn't even tried himself yet. If you survive the thoroughly harrowing cuisine, you can either warn him of its danger or tell him it's delicious. If you choose the latter, he will sample the food and <em>drop dead</em>.
<ul><li> The game implies that the man who gave him the recipes is Sir Roderick Ponce von Fontlebottom, a man from the game's equivalent of England. It's possible that the dishes are standard English cuisine like Bubble &amp; Squeak or a Full English, with them only being considered disgusting due to cultural differences.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em>. In one dungeon infested with undead, you can find a piece of cheese. If one didn't think a piece of cheese found in thousand-years old ruins would be bad to eat, the description for the cheese even says "It's quite smelly and no doubt highly deadly. Only the unwise would eat it." Eating it results in a big Damage over Time-effect that lasts for 20 minutes, in addition to the character title "The Unwise".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> plays with this trope with mackerel, a fish that is safe for humans to eat. When consumed by androids, however, it is as dangerous and lethal as eating a blowfish; bodily fluids congeal, paralysis sets in, and death follows shortly thereafter. Reportedly, however, it is still very delicious, even as it kills you. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie">You can eat it, too, if you like.</a>

You can buy innocuous enough food from vendors, like grapes, bread, fruit juice, tea, or filtered water, but if you pick up the Cooking skill, bad things start to happen immediately. If you can kill it and it's not obviously sentient (with the exception of murlocs), somebody's figured out a way to make it into a stat-boosting food. You can learn to make bat wings, rat stew, spider cake, wolf steak, bear burgers, rhino stew, ravager sausages, chimera chops, and a brand of chili so hot that it causes you to randomly breathe flame, among many other options.
<ul><li> Bear is the odd man out on this list, as it is in fact quite a tasty meal.

<ul><li> The "Rum Deal" quest has the player assisting with creating Braindeath 'Rum' also known as unsanitary swill that a bunch of zombie pirates want since they have surrounded the brewery where it is made and made the workers afraid to go outside. The ingredients include stagnant water, mind controlling sluglings, blindweed, and the corpse of a disease carrying fever spider. The examine text for a bottle of it says "I think it is eating through the bottle." and if you drink it, you receive the message "With a sense of impending doom you drink the 'rum'. You try very hard not to die."
</li><li> The "Recipe for Disaster" quest has several dodgy sounding recipes in it.
<ul><li> The quest starts with a cook asking you to bring him some difficult to find ingredients for a special feast. These ingredients include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeOfNewt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeOfNewt">Eye of Newt</a>, a greenman's ale, a rotten tomato, and a fruit blast cocktail with ashes in it. It isn't shown what the rest of the ingredients were or what he made from them. It turns out however, that it wasn't a recipe after all, but actually a food based spell which unleashes an evil food wizard called the Culinaromancer. The player must then save the guests attending the feast by creating their favorite food in order to undo the Culinaromancer's spell on them.
</li><li> To save the two goblin generals, who disagree with each other on everything, the player must create the slop of compromise, which is made from orange slices that are dyed so they aren't orange, maggots with spice added so that they aren't bland, and bread with water added so that it isn't crunchy.
</li><li> To save the mountain dwarf, the players must get a dwarven rock cake, which is too hot to eat when you first get it and have to find a way to cool it down, and even after that it still is too hard for human consumption, but dwarves can eat it fine. And also during the quest you have to make Asgoldian ale, which is Asgarnian ale with a gold coin dissolved in it, in order to convince the dwarf that knows the rock cake recipe to make it for you. This makes the ale unfit for human consumption, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">although if you think about it</a>, if it can dissolve gold it probably shouldn't be safe to drink even before adding the gold either.
</li><li> To save the monkey king, you need to cook a giant snake stuffed with nuts and red bananas on a lava heated rock.
</li></ul></li><li> The favorite drink of werewolves is a beverage called moonlight mead, which is made from bittercap mushrooms, and technically isn't mead since it doesn't contain honey. Drinking it gives you the message "It tastes like something just died in your mouth." although that might be the reason why werewolves like it. Werewolves also like to eat pickled human brains.
</li></ul></li><li> The first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> games have a cooking activity where you bring one or two items to a chef to see what they make out of them. A few of the resulting items can't actually be eaten and are used as weapons or cause harm when they are eaten. The best example is the item called trial stew. It made by combining a couple's cake with a poison mushroom. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> it reduces your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">HP to 1</a> and FP to 0, but completely fills your star power and temporarily triples how fast you gain it. While in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em> it also reduces your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">HP to 1</a> but gives you a huge amount of experience. Giving an invalid ingredient combination produces a dish called mistake, which heals 1 HP. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em> also has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">taboo fruit</a>, which the player has to find in order to cure Princess Peach after she falls into a 100 year sleep due to eating a delicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">golden apple</a>. The taboo fruit turns out to be a black apple, which is the only thing that can permanently counter the effects of the golden apple because it tastes absolutely awful.

It apparently tastes awful, though Homer still finishes it. He then buys several cans of a crab juice soft drink from the vendor. About 20 seasons later, the Simpsons return to New York, and Homer discovers that the vendor has now become a successfull entrepeneur with a franchise of klav kalash restaurants.
