In fact, it's their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>. They may be this way as a result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory">experience</a>, simple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">shyness</a>, or because they just don't have the tolerance/patience for such things. Sometimes there's something wrong with them in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">dangerous way</a> and they know it. There's a good chance that they may be something of a loner as well. Sometimes they change for the better later on, sometimes they don't, and sometimes the fact that they don't like to be touched isn't treated as a problem in the first place.
</p><p>If it's treated like a problem, expect their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> to attempt to fix it at some point. Most of the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">they succeed</a> but the number of blunders and the time it takes depends greatly on the genre and nature of the story. At other times, they may already have a special person whose touch doesn't trigger any adverse reaction, indicating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust">particularly trusting relationship</a>.

The <em>perception</em> that someone hates being touched can also be a result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">Culture Clash</a>: if someone believes that touching is an intimate gesture to be shared among close friends and lovers, then the American custom of shaking hands with someone the first time you meet them would be overly intimate, akin to walking up to a complete stranger, grabbing their face, and Frenching them. Depending on culture and personality, attempting to touch the person could result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandshakeRefusal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandshakeRefusal">Handshake Refusal</a>, the person stepping back to regain some sense of personal space, or an attack on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader">Personal Space Invader</a>; however, adequately befriending them usually removes the touch taboo in this case.

</p><p>If someone like this actually <em>lets</em> someone else touch them, you can rest assured that something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">serious</a> has just happened. Or the person they allow to touch them may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">the only exception whether in a romantic sense, or otherwise</a>.
</p><p>For instant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity</a>, pair them up with someone who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">No Sense of Personal Space</a> or is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuddleBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuddleBug">Cuddle Bug</a>.

May sometimes be a trait that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> share. Compare and contrast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionHatingKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionHatingKid">Affection-Hating Kid</a>, who does hate hugs, but touching isn't the issue— the sentiment is.

<ul><li> Ao in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsteroidInLove">Asteroid in Love</a></em> doesn't like people coming close to her. She gets fully blushed when Misa gets close to her during Chapter 7/Episode 3, while during Episode 11/Chapter 35, she's acting defensive when Shiho comes close to her. In the latter case, Shiho concluded from this that Ao is a rather shy person. The only person she doesn't have problem getting close to is Mira.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeAnthropomorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoeAnthropomorphism">Japan</a> does not react well to Italy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">hugging and kissing him</a>. Or to Korea trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkinshipGrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkinshipGrope">claim his breasts</a>. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey">waking up naked next to Greece</a>. It's one of the surefire ways to make his stoic exterior crack, really.
</li><li> Germany fits this to a lesser degree. While he lets himself being touched by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuddleBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuddleBug">Italy</a> when Italy wanted to hug someone and Japan didn't want to be hugged, Germany didn't seem to fond of it, either.
</li><li> Due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> personalities, Romano and England can be like this too.
</li></ul></li><li> Guts from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, as mentioned in the quote above, as a result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being raped by one of his adoptive father's men during his childhood</span>. The only exceptions are his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> Casca and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Griffith</a>, and even Casca <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">almost got strangled to death during their first time together due to Guts flashing back to what Donovan did to him</span>.
<ul><li> During his stay with the Band of the Hawk, Guts <em>did</em> appear to be getting over this, as he became more chummy with his comrades and became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTrust">more trusting of others close to him</a>. Then the Eclipse happened. You can guess what state he reverted back into.
<ul><li> Based on this information, you can say that Guts' issue with people touching him has a lot to do with his trust in others, not just a single traumatic physical experience. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimatePsychotherapy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimatePsychotherapy">After his time with Casca,</a> Guts really doesn't talk about his childhood after that, but after the Eclipse, he goes back to hating being touched. It goes to show how much he felt betrayed by a man that he trusted, the second time in his life.
</li></ul></li><li> Once used for hilarity rather than drama, though. When he refuses to join the Hawks in a huge celebration after his first major battle with them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Pippin</a> just grabs him, hauls Guts over his shoulder and drags him to the group kicking and screaming.
</li><li> And as for Casca, after being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raped into insanity by Femto during the Eclipse</span>, she has shown signs of this herself. When Guts tries to touch her following the ordeal, she responds quite badly, both when she and Guts are with Godo, Rickert and Erica immediately following the Eclipse, and later in the Millennium Falcon arc after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Guts' personal Beast almost gets him to rape her</span>, where she bites Guts' hand and then hides behind Farnese, the only one who she seems to allow to touch her. Which only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbrokenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartbrokenBadass">adds to Guts' misery</a>, considering how close they were before everything went to hell.
</li></ul></li><li> Hinako from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BitterVirgin">Bitter Virgin</a></em> has this in regards to men due to suffering several years of sexual abuse by her stepfather.
</li><li> Ciel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>. He appears to not enjoy physical contact, and has been shown slapping and insulting individuals for being too comfortable with touching or speaking to him. However, he tolerates Sebastian and does not complain when the demon picks him up or holds him. If he is stressed, he will also slap someone touching him away, proclaiming, "Don't touch me so easily!" This is a negative influence of the trauma he underwent during his time as a slave, which is implied to have included rape. Ciel tolerates Elizabeth's physical contact, as well. The fact she's his fiancee, and has known him since they were little may have something to do with it. In chapter 90, Ciel goes back to being this way towards everyone except Finnian after being cursed by poisonous gas and being reminded of his awful childhood.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yu Kanda. Considering he spent his childhood up until about the age of 10 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being used as a guinea pig for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>-tastic experiments by the Black Order</span>, this isn't entirely surprising.
</li><li> Allen now qualifies as well, if only in one instance so far (chapter 215). He repeats, "Don't come near me!" after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nearly killing Johnny as the Fourteenth.</span> Quite a bit of self-loathing there.
</li></ul></li><li> Hisoka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DescendantsOfDarkness">Descendants of Darkness</a></em>. Explained to be due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">messed up family history</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">Muraki</a> raping him, <em>and</em> the fact that he's able to read the memories/feelings of others when he touches them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina">Yeesh</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> Light Yagami, especially when Misa is around.
</li><li> L is probably one too, as hinted by the fact that he doesn't like <em>touching</em> either objects or people, and will only use his fingertips to do it. Though L <em>does</em> tend to plant himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">awkwardly close to other people</a>, especially Light, and has no problem leaning straight into him - much to Light's blatant annoyance. L might be something of a subversion; he doesn't like touching objects, but people are fine.
</li></ul></li><li> Heine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DogsBulletsAndCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DogsBulletsAndCarnage">Dogs: Bullets &amp; Carnage</a></em> has a bad reaction to being touched by women (except Nill for some reason that no one knows). Although his aversion for women is part of his traumatic backstory, it's played for laughs once when Naoto assumes that it's because he and Badou are in a homosexual relationship, and twice when Naoto faints and Heine should catch her but... doesn't.
</li><li> Kouji Minamoto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em>. He even says out loud in episode two that he hates being touched by strangers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lucy became like this as a result of her terrible childhood, though she doesn't mind if Kouta touches her.
</li><li> Mayu also follows this to a degree; the manga implies that her traumatic experience with her stepfather has soured her on men in general, and finding Kouta in the bath groping Nyu doesn't help. Ironically, she appears to bond most closely with Bandou, who generally treats her like crap, except for when he saved her from the "Unknown Man".

Most people know better than to try to get too touchy-feely with him. This is particularly obvious in that one episode of <em>The Second Raid</em>, where Kaname drags him out to get a haircut and he ends up holding the barber at gunpoint when his reflexes act up. In the same episode, though, it is shown that he is utterly calm about being touched by Kaname herself (who ends up being his personal hair stylist this way). Ironic, seeing how Kaname has probably single-handedly dished out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">more corporal punishment to him than all of his enemies combined</a>.

Rather than a distaste for being touched, the reason is more pragmatic. Gems come in varying degrees of hardness and physical contact runs a very real risk of the harder gem damaging the more fragile one. The exception to this are gems of the same type, like the Amethyst twins, who regularly do things like bang each others heads together. The fact that the Amethysts can do this, and do so regularly, is considered just a tad creepy by the others.

Played straight in Ocean's Dream Arc though this due to Nami having amnesia.
</li><li> Zoro similar to Nami dislikes his crewmates being overly touchy with him getting very annoyed at Chopper for clinging to his head when scared. In the Zou arc, Zoro also yelled at the Minks (who are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">compete opposite</a> of this trope) for nuzzling up to him.

This is because in the years he spent traveling, he was forced to kill to protect himself from bandits, and more relevantly, rapists. It's also notable that the only one he really lets touch him is Goku, and even then it'll put him in a pissy(er) mood.

Also, whenever he is shown having sex he only does it if he can get something out of it and he looks to be bored by it.

Ritsuka doubts this is true and has trouble tolerating it, and because of Ritsuka's cynical reaction, Soubi stops saying it altogether after volume 2 of the manga. Still, Ritsuka's inner conflict over whether he believes what Soubi says becomes a source of great tension and bitterness in their relationship.

Also in one of the ovas for the picture being taken Hiei stands away from the group, not wanting his picture taken at all. Kurama and Yusuke both grab him and carry him away, with him saying, "Get off me, fools!" However, Kuwabara grabs Hiei menacingly by the collar a couple of times throughout the series and he doesn't flinch; this is most likely because he doesn't actually deem Kuwabara as a threat because of how much stronger he is compared to Kuwabara.

</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2014CSLastChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2014CSLastChristmas">Last Christmas</a>", however, the Doctor is back to not wanting to be touched, with Clara being given a free pass.
</li><li> In Series 9 (Twelve's second series), the Doctor no longer minds being touched as he now hugs Clara of his own free will, enjoys her hugs, and Clara adopts face-stroking as a sign of affection.
</li></ul></li><li> The Thirteenth Doctor also has this trait, but it's not as noticeable as it was with Twelve because Thirteen is much more outgoing. But as of Series 12, her second season, she has yet to hug any of her companions even <em>once</em> and generally tries to avoid touching people.

About the extent of the contact he is willing to have with other people is handshakes, although very rarely he will put a hand on someone's arm to add emotional weight to what he's saying.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Harrison Wells of Earth-2</span> reacts badly to Cisco touching him, shoving him off and telling him in no uncertain terms not to touch him again.

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>, Joey gets an audition to replace a legendary local children's show host who hates being touched (though it's more of a psychological/medical condition). Joey does not know this and after he gets the job, he gives the former host a big hug and then leaves happily, but the touching gets the retiring host to fire Joey on the spot. Joey does not find out he had been fired or about the hosts condition until after he had sent him a hug-or-gram as a thank you, and rushes to stop it. There IS a happy ending here though; although the hug-o-gram does send the host into another fit, Joey quickly fills in and gives the host time to recover before his secret is revealed. Ranger Joe (the host in question) is so grateful is re-hires Joey just as fast as he fired him and is even implied to have let Joey give him a tentative handshake.

</li><li> Quinn Fabray also seems to have this, to a lesser extent. She lifts her hand between herself and Rachel when she touches her arm the first time and, of course, whenever her boyfriends try to get sexual with her, she puts a stop to it. She is also usually seen leaning against her boyfriends' arms when in contact with them, indicating that she is usually the one to initiate touching.

<ul><li> This is often felt by victims of sexual abuse, particularly if they were a child when it occurred. Through therapy, they can overcome this.
<ul><li> Similarly, those who were victims of nonsexual physical or emotional abuse can also go through this trope. A physical abuse victim may be so used to being physically hurt that they involuntarily flinch or move away if someone tries to touch them, even if the person in question is not their abuser. Meanwhile, an emotionally abused person may have such low self-esteem that when someone tries to be affectionate towards them, they may feel undeserving, uncomfortable, or not used to it. Unsurprisingly, this causes a lot of problems if the victim desires to become sexually active, but therapy can oftentimes help to alleviate these symptoms.

If a cat or dog does not receive enough social contact with humans when young, they can very easily develop lifelong issues with being touched and trusting people.
</li><li> When trying to tame one, feral cats have to be very, very delicately and gradually introduced to being petted, and even if successfully tamed (which can be very difficult), they may have various lifelong issues with touch, such as a strong fear of or hostility towards anyone but the tamer trying to pet them, hating being picked up, aggression when being petted while eating, refusal to be lap cats, etc.... They usually have to be accustomed to being fed by the tamer at a increasingly close distance for a period of time (at the very least almost every day for a few weeks or months) before even attempting to pet them, and they need to be gradually introduced to it because it will scare them. Stray cats, depending on the individual cat, may need to be treated in a similar manner, or they may allow absolutely anyone to pet them. Note here that there is a difference between feral cats and stray cats, feral cats by definition have had little to no contact with people whatsoever, so they are completely wild, whereas stray cats have had some pervious contact, usually a pervious owner, and so are more inclined to be trusting towards people.
