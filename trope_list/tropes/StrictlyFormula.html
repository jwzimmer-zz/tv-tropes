<ul><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> episode ever has essentially the same plot: A person, often an old friend to one of the team, is introduced, and either forms a bond with a team member, or some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> about how the old friend and the teammate know each other is exposited. The friend goes away just long enough for something bad to happen to him/her. Irrespective of which teammate's friend it was, Priss gets all pissed off about the situation and decides to take matters into her own hands. As she is suiting up, however, the rest of the team shows up because they've always got her back. The team suits up, and goes off to kick the problem's ass. There's a heartfelt apology from the friend(assuming they survived) who is ultimately never seen again, and a wry signoff/joke. THE END.
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> involved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">one of the Clow Cards</a> attacking or causing chaos in Sakura's neighbourhood, leading her to neutralise and capture it (a occasional variation in the anime version involved Syaoran sometimes stopping the card and earning it instead). The final arc after she becomes Master Of The Cards mostly involves Eriol sending some magical force up against Sakura so she must upgrade one of her cards to stop it. The formula was occasionally put aside to focus on the personal lives of the main characters along with several romantic side arcs.
</li><li> Almost every TV episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em> falls into this. Similarly to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, the episode will almost always begin with Nobita crying about a problem and begging Doraemon for a gadget of the week whether it is getting revenge from the bullies Gian and Suneo, solving his school struggles, or showing off over Suneo's wealth. Nobita will abuse said gadget or it will end up stolen by Gian and Suneo and both misuse it themselves. Doraemon has to get it back and morale is taught or not.
</li><li> Along with borrowing heavily from the series, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">Non Serial Movies</a> had a very distinct formula that they rarely broke from: the Z-Warriors are living their lives normally, the villain is introduced and does some damage, alongside various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">side villains</a>, the heroes attempt to defeat the villain right away but are repulsed, the side villains and the non-central Z-Fighters duke it out, the main character (Goku, and very occasionally Gohan) fights evenly with the main villain for a while, the main villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">reveals his true power</a> and inflicts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> onto everyone, and then Goku <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">pulls out a technique</a> that defeats the villain. Piccolo also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">shows up to save Gohan</a> at some point, and in later movies Vegeta shows up to save Goku saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">"you must be defeated by my hand!"</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> follows the same formula whenever a new dark guild or evil organization rears its ugly head: Fairy Tail mows down all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjitsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfNinjitsu">no effort</a>, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> gives them some trouble before getting taken out, all leading up to the climactic battle against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, who (most often) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Natsu</a> takes down after being pushed to the brink. Pepper it with some tragic backstories for new villains or known characters, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> or two, and at least one of the heroes' new enemies/allies exclaiming how insane Fairy Tail is, and you have your standard story arc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FrankenFran">Franken Fran</a></em> gets a patient who wants something. She gives it to them through super surgery. It comes back to bite them in the ass. Fran tries to fix it, and ends up making it worse. Fran shrugs it off and moves on to the next patient.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em>: Introduce Victim and their problems, revolving around a central Tormentor. Victim contacts Hell Correspondence to deal with the Tormentor. Ai leaves them a straw doll and states the terms of the contract. Victim mulls it over. Tormentor comes back to make their life hell. Victim is driven to the brink of despair and pulls the string near the end of the episode. Flashy torture sequence in which the Tormentor meets Ai and is sentenced to Hell. Victim is shown living with the consequences. This is the fundamental formula for all three seasons of the anime. There is an over-arching plot (particularly in the second series) that is sandwiched in, but usually doesn't take up too much time until the season finale. However, the more creepy and/or unusual episodes, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">abandoned hospital</a> in Episode 17 of the first season shake up the formula. In the manga (which came later), most of the series plot is reduced, further invoking this trope.
</li><li> Most of the cases in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KindaichiCaseFiles">Kindaichi Case Files</a></em> follows Kindaichi and Miyuki (plus some other friends) going on a trip and encountering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">series of gruesome murders</a>. When Kindaichi inevitably uncovers the mystery, the killer will start a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveRant">Motive Rant</a> about how the victims had caused the death, intentionally or otherwise, of the killer's loved one, before breaking down with the burden of their guilt, then trying to commit suicide.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em> nearly always followed this formula: Kirby and his friends live their happy lives. Dedede acts stupid and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">orders a monster</a>, or on rare occasions, NightMare Enterprises sends something over without immediately informing him. The monster attacks. Kirby inhales something and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">copies its power</a>. The monster is defeated. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Kirby and his friends return to living their happy lives</a>. This extends to even the special two-part episodes, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>. The only episodes that don't seem to follow this are a couple of the "someone comes to Dream Land to get revenge for something" episodes, and even then, there are many similarities to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLaughingSalesman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLaughingSalesman">The Laughing Salesman</a></em> usually goes like this: We meet an ordinary person with some everyday problem. Moguro shows up and offers them a supernatural solution to their problem, which comes with some very strange but very strict guidelines for its use. Moguro's customer uses the supernatural solution, but either due to greed, ambition, pride, or some other character flaw ignores his guidelines and suffers horribly as a result. Moguro closes out the episode with some pithy commentary on how foolish his customer was and walks off laughing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em>:
<ul><li> TV episodes generally follow the formula of "Lupin and gang arrive in a new location, and plot to steal something. They do, but Fujiko double-crosses them. Zenigata shows up and attempts to arrest the gang, but fails. The end."
</li><li> The movies and TV specials tend to follow a more strict formula: Opening heist, exposition about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, plot-important <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girl of the Week</a>, evil organization attempting to get the girl/item, Goemon shows up for one scene and acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsumesBookOfFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NatsumesBookOfFriends">Natsume's Book of Friends</a></em> episodes usually follow this pattern: An ayakashi is trying to kill/possess/drain life force from the main character. Natsume manages to survive, but doesn't kill the creature nor lets Nyanko-sensei finish it off, only takes pity on it instead, upon learning the reason the creature had, which is always some serious problem. Natsume then proceeds to help said ayakashi, often getting exhausted and fainting in the process. When he regains consciousness, the problem is either already solved, or it will be in the next few minutes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Oishinbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Oishinbo">Oishinbo</a></em> stories usually follow this pattern: The staff at the <em>Tozai News</em> are invited to dinner by a highly regarded man. (For some reason, it's always a man and never a woman.) Everybody praises the food, except for Yamaoka who states that it hasn't been prepared the way it should in order to make the flavor ideal. The rest of the <em>Tozai News</em> staff tells him to apologize, but instead he invites everybody present to a dinner in a little while, where he promises to show them how the dish ought to be made. Then, he and Kurita go procure the main ingredient for the meal, while Yamaoka tells Kurita about it. For instance, if he'll be making sashimi Yamaoka will go catch a salmon while explaining while this particular kind of salmon is the best fish for sashimi. The day of Yamaoka's dinner arrives, and he treats everybody to a delicious meal. Once they've started eating, the dinner guests will always gush about how great the food is in a very detailed way, saying things like "Delicious! The sour pork doesn't hide the taste of the salmon!" At this point, Yamaoka will reveal that he made the food in some unconventional and unexpected way, everybody is shocked, and the person who hosted the dinner at the beginning of the chapter will admit that up until now he hadn't truly understood how the dish should be cooked.

Despite this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">every story arc manage to be very different from the others.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ash spent 20 years traveling in a very strict pattern. He would be accompanied by one (1) boy, usually elder and a Gym Leader, and one (1) girl of similar age, either a Gym Leader or the female protagonist from the region's respective games (if either partner has a little sibling, they may be included). Ash would travel the region in search of eight (8) gym badges and will take part in one (1) League tournament, which he would lose. The girl of the group, if a female protagonist, would be engaged in her own competitions, usually Pokémon pageantry of some kind, culminating in a final competition, which she would also lose.
</li><li> For a long time, almost every episode followed this formula: Ash and friends meet the person of the week and/or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Pokémon of the week</a>. This person/Pokémon will have a problem. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldfishPoopGang">Team Rocket</a> will plot to steal Pikachu and/or the Pokémon of the week and are defeated in short order, with the problem of the week solved either by Team Rocket's defeat or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">some unrelated event</a>. In the event Team Rocket get defeated much earlier in the episode and the conflict isn't fully resolved and/or they were defeated in a way that didn't involve Pikachu's Thunderbolt, they try again until it nears the episode's end and they get zapped. If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Pokémon of the week</a> does not have a trainer, sometimes Ash or one of his friends will catch it. The only exceptions to this formula are Gym battles, character development episodes, or plot points from the games, but even these tend to have their own formulas.
</li><li> The formula only changed with the <em>Best Wishes</em> series (2011-2013), where Team Rocket got a big boost in competence and much less screentime, the implication being they had their hands full with special directives or other serious business, leaving Ash and co. alone. They didn't show up once per episode, and they didn't have much bearing on Ash's side of the plot. The half-season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> before Pokémon X and Y came out turned them back to normal, though they still get a couple episodes of non-absence. Additionally, the Gen 5 arc also altered the "Ash catches five Pokémon in a region, releases or otherwise gives up one, and then catches another Pokémon to replace it" gimmick, where he instead had a team of eight (not counting Pikachu) with no releases, though out of those, four got shafted in terms of screen time to make room for the starters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Scraggy</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a> rejoining of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">Charizard</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Sun and Moon</em> series (2016-2019), where the adventure-style layout was instead changed to a school-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> show, threw the old formula completely out the window. Characters of the week are few and far in between, with most interactions being between the main cast and their Pokémon. In contrast to previous seasons, which had 3-4 main characters, there are now 6 main characters, and 1 extra Pokémon sidekick. Pokémon of the week are often implemented into the show more naturally, rather than being overexposed and being made the focus of the whole episode. In contrast to previous seasons, events from previous episodes are often regularly brought back and mentioned, adding more continuity. Team Rocket, while now humorous again, have become surprisingly competent and do not appear in every single episode.
</li><li> <em>Pokémon Journeys</em> (2019-) sees only two total main characters, Ash and Goh, doing research for Professor Cerise across all of the existing regions and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Galar</a>, revisiting the adventure layout from previous series while also having elements of <em>Sun and Moon</em>'s lesser number of characters of the week and increased focus on humor. Furthermore, there are no female companions this time around, though Chloe, Cerise's daughter, is occasionally given focus. More emphasis on Pokémon catching is present, with Goh regularly catching Pokémon in many episodes. The Team Rocket Trio, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">especially since Ash is now the champion of Alola</span>, now have a machine that dispenses powerful Pokémon for them, allowing them to still be the balance between competence and silliness that they were in Alola.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">The movies</a> follow such a rigid formula that you'd swear that they only have two or three plots they recycle every year: Ash and friends will enter a location with a completely different appearance from the region they're supposed to be in, possibly come across the newest Mythical Pokémon/a Pokémon from the next generation of games, then come into conflict with an antagonist; either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericDoomsdayVillain">one-dimensional</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">bastard human</a> who wants to use the title Pokémon for his (and yes, it's almost always a man) own evil ends, or a big, scary and evil-looking Pokémon with sinister/disasterous goals. If the antagonist is a human, expect them to be irredeemable jackasses through and through, though there is a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> for some of them, but if it's a Pokémon, 90% of the time they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood">Not Evil, Just Misunderstood</a>, and the other 10% perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. Oftentimes, the world will be at stake, a large-scale battle happens, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a> or two will occur, Team Rocket <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryLine">show up and do absolutely nothing significant</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> or two will be shown off (the portrayal of which may or may not directly contradict how they work in the games). To top it off, despite all that happens across the movie, its events will rarely, if ever, actually be referenced in the actual show. The 20th movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou">Pokémon: I Choose You!</a></em>, avoids this formula. It has no true villain (the closest thing being Ash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> rival, Cross), Team Rocket doesn't appear, the fate of the world is never at stake, and it takes place in an alternate timeline from the main series. There <em>is</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>, though.
</li><li> The endgame for the Pokémon arcs. After Ash gets the final badge, two things happen. One, the villains of the region get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicDeadline">a rushed closure</a> with their downfall being closely related to a Legendary Pokémon who is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonProtagonistResolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonProtagonistResolver">Non-Protagonist Resolver</a>. And then Ash enters the league where he'll <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> almost</span> <em>always</em> lose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">a guy with stronger Pokémon</a> bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> (always a male character), and then he'll ditch his friends and Pokémon and journey to the next region, hitting a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> on the way out. <em>X and Y</em> subverted this by first handling the league arc, <em>then</em> making the Villainous Team arc the true finale of the season. And while Zygarde played a major role in stopping Team Flare, Ash and the entire supporting cast (including the Gym Leaders, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">Hero of Another Story</a>, and Champions) got to play a majorly important role as well. Once again, <em>Sun and Moon</em> completely averts it by having Ash <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> actually WIN the League for the first time since the Orange Islands</span>.
</li><li> Ash wasn't often the only one having to change his teams out per the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Bag of Spilling</a>. When Brock was still a major character for Ash's later journeys through Hoenn, the Kanto Battle Frontier, and Sinnoh, he would remove some of the Pokemon from his team as well by leaving them at his gym (Onix, Geodude, and Crobat for Hoenn, Ludicolo for Kanto, and Forretress and Marshtomp for Sinnoh). May also did it to a lesser extent for the Kanto Battle Frontier when she removed Beautifly, Skitty, and Bulbasaur from her team. Even <em>Team Rocket</em> started to do this starting with Unova.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> seasons fall into formula to at least some degree, but some are much more noteworthy than others:
<ul><li> Every single episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Pretty Cure Max Heart</a></em> sees Nagisa encounter some kind of everyday problem, begin to deal with said problem, get attacked out of nowhere by a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> who summons a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> for no real reason, transform alongside Honoka, fight said monster to a standstill until Hikari transforms into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Shiny Luminous</a>, and finish up with either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Marble Screw Max</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">Extreme Luminario</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Marble Screw Max Spark</a>; monster gets defeated, miniboss squad member runs off, and Nagisa deals with whatever problem she was worried about, roll credits.
</li><li> Nearly every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SmilePrettyCure">Smile Pretty Cure!</a></em> has the girls dealing with some sort of mundane problem or one caused by one of Majorina's gimmick items, cutting to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> having some sort of discussion or argument that relates to or causes the problem. One of them goes to wherever the girls happen to be, gives their stock Bad Energy-gathering speech and advances Pierrot's countdown clock one tick. The girls arrive too late to stop this from happening, and the miniboss summons an Akanbe so the girls can collect a new Cure Decor from beating it with Rainbow Healing, Rainbow Burst or Royal Rainbow Burst. Whatever the method used, the miniboss runs off and the girls settle the mundane problem. That this formula means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">the villains have no actual reason to summon monsters other than to hand powerups to the girls</a> is the source of many a wallbanger.
</li><li> The job episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HugttoPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HugttoPrettyCure">Hugtto! Pretty Cure</a></em> contain the girls learning about a specific career and being taught the responsibilities of said job. Just when they've got the hang of it, someone else who works for the company, or someone who happens to be visiting for the day <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">becomes a target for the Oshimaida</a>. After the battle, the girls thank the people at the job for the opportunity, and then take a commemorative photo with the Mirai Pad.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>: One of the girls makes a new friend or had the friend without ever mentioning it, the friend has some kind of problem (romantic 99% of times), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> decides that — OMG, coincidence! — said friend is <em>definitely</em> the person who has... whatever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is looking for, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> send a monster of the week, Sailor Moon and company start losing, Tuxedo Mask throws a rose and makes a small speech regarding the problem of the victim of the week, Sailor Moon uses her overly long attack to defeat the monster, figures out the victim didn't have whatever the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is looking for and the friend's problem is solved by the end of the episode, thanks to the fight or not. Also, the new friend will seem to have formed a strong, meaningful bond with one or all of the Sailor Guardians... and then they are never seen or spoken of again. This was in the anime version, the manga and live-action version was more about the Guardians. Parodied <a class="urllink" href="http://www.deviantart.com/art/How-to-Write-Sailor-Moon-44115322">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> movies (with the exception of the second one) generally follow the same format as the Posidon arc of the manga - Greek God X arrises, proclaims they will destroy all of mankind; Athena confronts said god by herself and is promptly set up for a slow, tortuous death as a human sacrifice and her bronze saints (as the main characters) are given some arbitrary time limit to fight through the bad guy's minions and rescue her. Inevitably, they are all defeated at least once until Seiya (and sometimes Ikki) manages to struggle into the main baddie's chamber, whereupon he focuses all his and his friends' energy into the single punch that he's learned and blows the baddie to space dust. Athena is rescued, roll credits, the end. You could set your watch by it. Some of the other consistent guideposts: Hyouga will get curbstomped ala <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">Worf</a>. Shiryu will get beat within an inch of his life, but triumphs after shedding his armor to unleash his true power, and then collapses. Shun will fight defensively, get ripped apart, and call for his Big Brother with his last conscious breath. Ikki will then teleport in and avenge his little bro by viciously one-shotting the offender, but then gets Worf-stomped by the Dragon or Big Bad. Seiya will get debilitated somehow (blinding or poisoning, usually) and get thrown down a cliff or stairway, or into a ravine, which he will slowly and painfully make his way back up from, for the final confrontation as described above. Like clockwork.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>: Mr. Itoshiki is all riled up about some aspect of society.

He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">declares that the aspect of society has left him in despair,</a> possibly attempting suicide. Then, either Kafuka or Chiri shows up to show the positive side of the aspect of society or comment on the aspect of society's proper/ improperness. Then there might be some sort of punchline or something. This formula is followed all but the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarroEpisode">surreal</a> episodes, with the exception of some of the character introductions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TisTimeForTorturePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TisTimeForTorturePrincess">Tis Time for "Torture," Princess</a></em> establishes the basic formula early on: Tortura greets the Princess with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">"'Tis time for 'torture', Princess"</a> and introduces that episode's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">"torture"</a>, which is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodAsBribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodAsBribe">a bribe of delicious food</a> or some other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneLuxury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneLuxury">Mundane Luxury</a>. The Princess looks like she's going to resist, causing Ex to brag about her strict upbringing or accomplishments on the battlefield, only for the Princess to cave when Tortura introduces some twist to sweeten the deal. At the end Tortura reports to the Hell-Lord with what she found out, only for him to dismiss it as unimportant or for a really trivial reason.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YakitateJapan">Yakitate!! Japan</a></em> fell into this during the Yakitate 25 arc, with the basic plot elements of every match just repeating themselves after a while. This might be the reason it was eventually aborted to quickly switch to the final battle instead (and the anime version made it Yakitate 9 instead).

Val's Vanishing Cream (with Val and her vanishing cream which made things invisible) which followed a simple formula of Character with gimmick is having fun, a bully spoils that fun, Character uses gimmick to get back at bully and ends with gimmicky character having fun.

After his transformation said loner is always happier with his life. This is a more jarring example, especially to those outside the small niche he's aiming these fics at.

Ironically though, the problem seems to have been that all these movies came out in succession, as every single movie of the Disney Renaissance has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> and is now well-loved (some more than others: <em>Pocahontas</em> is still not thought of as a great movie, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRescuersDownUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRescuersDownUnder">The Rescuers Down Under</a></em> has gained a cult following but isn't anywhere near mainstream).
</li><li> Four consecutive Disney films had a formula of their own: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WreckItRalph">Wreck-It Ralph</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigHero6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigHero6">Big Hero 6</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em> all ditched the classic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> Disney villains in favor of keeping the identity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> as a climactic plot twisting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">reveal</a>, which fans eventually began to expect. The latter three films added another aspect to the formula by having an unsavory character, always played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanTudyk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanTudyk">Alan Tudyk</a>, serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">a decoy villain</a> to further obfuscate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s identity. The first film to mess with this trend was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Moana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Moana">Moana</a></em>, which had a different kind of villain twist: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Big Bad (established as such early on rather than being revealed at the last minute) turns out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a>, corrupted into a monster for want of the very Macguffin Moana is trying to replace. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">And Alan Tudyk played not the decoy villain, but a chicken.</a></span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DreamWorksAnimation">DreamWorks Animation</a> has also been accused of enforcing this trope in most of their CGI-animated movies during the 2000s: in the beginning, the main character is an outcast (or at the very least is "different"). Throughout the film he becomes a better person. In the end, he saves the day and everyone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">accepts him for who he is.</a> Add bonus points for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReferenceOverdosed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReferenceOverdosed">pop culture references,</a> fart jokes, gratuitous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityVoiceActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityVoiceActor">Celebrity Voice Actors</a>, and the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWorksFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamWorksFace">DreamWorks Face</a>, and you're good to go.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> films. They start with Indy on an adventure to acquire a treasure that's unrelated to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>.

He will then visit various exotic locales and use clues to discover the whereabouts of the aforementioned object, fighting the villains as well as picking up a girl and sidekick as he does so. The sidekick or girl (or both) will get captured at some point and Indy will have to rescue them. Indy himself will also be captured at some point, but escape. There will be a prolonged one-on-one fist fight with a guy working for the villains, as well as a chase scene. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> will eventually get their hands on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>, generally by following Indy to it, only to be killed by their own greed or recklessness.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> movies. First, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondGunBarrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondGunBarrel">gun barrel</a>, then a teaser (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyWaysideTribe">which might not be related to the plot</a> and often instead depict Bond on another mission); credits with dancing silhouettes and a song from a popular artist; mission briefing by M or a surrogate character; a further briefing with Q regarding gadgets and weapons available for use (though this was averted for the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig">Daniel Craig</a> Bond film); Bond usually gets involved with a Bond Girl and a female henchman; Bond gambles with the villain; henchmen ordered to kill Bond; female henchman dies; Bond enters the villain's base (voluntarily or captured); the villain reveals his plans (sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMrBondIExpectYouToDine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMrBondIExpectYouToDine">over dinner</a>); and Bond foils the plans and gets away — along with the Bond Girl — from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollapsingLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollapsingLair">Collapsing Lair</a>. Sometimes he must survive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonTheirFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonTheirFeet">one final confrontation</a> with a surviving henchman. And there's always a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene">Chase Scene</a>, many times involving a helicopter. There are numerous Bond films that break the formula, of course:
<ul><li> There is no romance with the Bond girl and no female henchman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/QuantumOfSolace">Quantum of Solace</a></em>.
</li><li> There is no actual Bond girl in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em> beyond a briefly seen secondary character.
</li><li> The Bond girl <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dies</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnHerMajestysSecretService">On Her Majesty's Secret Service</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em>.
</li><li> Q does not appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie">Live and Let Die</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em> or <em>Quantum of Solace</em>. It is perhaps not a coincidence that most aversions to the Bond formula have taken place during periods of reinvention for the character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough">The World Is Not Enough</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Elektra King</span> as the first Bond Girl who's also the main villain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LicenceToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LicenceToKill">Licence to Kill</a></em> has one of the biggest breaks from formula in having it take entirely in the US and Latin America, having Bond be motivated entirely by revenge in bringing down Sanchez, and Q having a larger role beyond his usual one-scene cameos.
</li><li> Q getting a larger role beyond a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">One-Scene Wonder</a> became a standard feature beginning with Ben Wishaw's Q in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skyfall">Skyfall</a></em>.
</li><li> The Bond girl is always a one-off character who appears for that movie and never returns again. For a long time, the sole exception to this was Sylvia Trench, who was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrNo">Dr. No</a></em> and then had a small part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove">From Russia with Love</a></em>. Madeleine Swann became the first time a main Bond Girl returned for a second movie, coming back for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoTimeToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NoTimeToDie">No Time to Die</a></em> after appearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>.

They both develop as people with the guy becoming less immature and the woman becoming less of a control freak, but ultimately grow too far apart to rekindle things and start different relationships.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th">Friday the 13th</a></em> series didn't actually settle down into its formula of "Jason shows up to kill a bunch of horny teens" until about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPartIII">third entry</a>, as in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th1980" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13th1980">first film</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jason wasn't the killer at all</span>, and in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPart2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FridayThe13thPart2">second film</a> his identity wasn't revealed until quite late on, and he looked significantly different to his later appearances. After that the formula generally held true with some small variations for the following films.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a></em> movie features someone getting a vision of themselves and other people dying in a big accident. They save themselves and about eight or so other people from it, only for them all to die in horrible ways in the order they would have died in the accident. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a> because puny humans can't cheat Death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorLeague">Major League</a></em> is probably one of the most unoriginal sports movies ever made, with the traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a> (a pitcher who can't hit the strike zone?

<ul><li> Every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection">American Girl</a> up to a certain point gets a series of 6 books written to formula down to the titles: <em>Meet [Name]</em> (introduction), <em>Lessons for [Name]</em> (school), <em>[Name]'s Surprise</em> (Christmas), <em>Happy Birthday, [Name]!</em> (birthday), <em>[Name] Saves the Day</em> (some sort of adventure), and <em>Changes for [Name]</em> (ending/wrapup of ongoing plot). They had to break the formula with Kaya, though, since she's Nez Perce and didn't have formal schooling or Christmas, and were similarly loose with the rest of them up until the switchover to BeForever. Post-BeForever books are generally much less formulaic; it helps that they're written as two 200-page books instead of six 80-page ones.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnitaBlake">Anita Blake</a></em> novels are <em>immensely</em> formulaic. Just read the work's page on This Very Wiki. The sex scenes also follow a general formula: Anita is propositioned by one or more people, but refuses on moral grounds. The <em>arduer</em> takes over, hair is pulled and mutual screaming orgasms are achieved.
</li><li> Daniel Handler's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>. Books 2-7 are all of the same basic pattern of the Baudelaires being sent to a new guardian and Olaf arriving in disguise to try and steal their money. Surprisingly, the formula is broken halfway through the series after the VFD subplot takes over.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>:
<ul><li> His <em>Azazel</em> stories have a specific formula to them. One of George's friends wants something impossible (to be able to fly, to never have to wait in line, etc.) Azazel uses magic (or superscience, if Asimov was trying to sell the story to a sci-fi outlet) to solve the problem. This, in turn, ruins said friend's life. The only exception, "A Dim Rumble," has Azazel's intervention instead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leave a world-shattering super-weapon on the loose</span>.
</li><li> There are a number of other outcomes. There is, for example, a story where a woman becomes more beautiful, but it damages her personality for the worse and hurts her husband. Or a story where a guy is turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">Living Lie Detector</a> and it causes problems for his girlfriend. In this case we get the formula of ruining the life of someone around the friend. The third formula is George intending to benefit from the change, but failing to. The sole case when George does gain something seems to be in "To the Victor", where he gets laid by a beautiful girl offscreen.
</li><li> Similarly, his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackWidowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlackWidowers">Black Widowers</a></em> stories are just as formulaic. The Widowers meet in the Milano with a guest and dine, waited upon by Henry Jackson. The guest has a problem that he tells he widowers about. The Widowers discuss possible solutions, all are shot down by the guest. Then they turn to the waiter, Henry. The guest is surprised about this, but it is explained Henry is considered a member of the club. Henry then solves the case.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrotherCadfael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrotherCadfael">Brother Cadfael</a></em> novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllisPeters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllisPeters">Ellis Peters</a> have fairly formulaic romance subplots — as soon as the young lady is introduced, you <em>know</em> she'll be one half of the meant-to-be-together couple, and ditto with the young man; and you <em>know</em> that despite everything that threatens to keep them apart, they <em>will</em> get together in the end, one way or another. This predictability and warm fuzziness are part of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CozyMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CozyMystery">Cozy Mystery</a>" genre, and it doesn't get boring because the writing is good and the mysteries themselves don't get stale.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a></em> stories tend to proceed as follows: the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePoliticalOfficer">commissar</a> is deployed to a new crisis zone, and runs into some trouble during or shortly after his arrival there. After that it quickly becomes clear that things are not as they seem, and while Cain and his soldiers fight against the preliminary threat, he soon uncovers evidence of another force at work. While his allies prepare for a push against the first enemy, Cain volunteers to go on a seemingly-unrelated errand or minor supporting mission under the logic that it's less likely to get him killed, only to discover that he's landed right in the middle of the real danger. But instead of running, Cain (often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickExMachina">with the help of Jurgen</a>) defeats the threat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">excusing his heroism as an attempt to maintain his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Fake Ultimate Hero</a> status. The book ends with him being debriefed (and afterwards, presumably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatWhatTheyreCallingItNow">de-briefed</a>) by his Inquisitor love interest, usually over dinner. Oh, and at some point he'll assure us that "If I had only known what was waiting for me, I would've [insert cowardly and/or self-deprecating action here]."
</li><li> Lester Dent (best known for his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage">Doc Savage</a></em> stories) actually had a standard formula he used for all his stories, described <a class="urllink" href="http://www.paper-dragon.com/1939/dent.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>:
<div class="indent">This is a formula, a master plot, for any 6000 word pulp story. It has worked on adventure, detective, western and war-air. It tells exactly where to put everything. It shows definitely just what must happen in each successive thousand words. No yarn of mine written to the formula has yet failed to sell. The business of building stories seems not much different from the business of building anything else.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> has a formula that seems to be followed to the letter in books one, two, three, and five:
<ul><li> Harry is working on a low-key wizarding (that is, consulting) job or personal business when two problems develop more or less simultaneously: a police investigation with a supernatural side and a client hiring him for his magical expertise. The two cases almost always turn out to be connected. He butts heads with the police frequently even if he's working on something with their blessing, because they don't know or don't like how the magical world works and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">he can't tell them</a>. He also butts heads with and insults local crime lord Johnny Marcone, but they're never actually enemies. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JamesBondage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JamesBondage">is tied up</a> and/or gets his ass kicked several times by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> as he's hunting down his two cases. He will do something awesome to save a woman. By the time he and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">allies in this story</a> finally find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanBarelyStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanBarelyStand">already in bad shape</a> but wins by throwing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a>.
</li><li> The sixth book appears to follow the formula at first but turns out to be a subversion. The later books go completely off the formula. The author says that this was a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sfsite.com/08b/jb182.htm">conscious choice<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which he did not initially believe would work, but which he made in an attempt to prove his writing teacher wrong. And then came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnyMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnyMore">Changes</a></em>...
</li></ul></li><li> This is taken to a ridiculous extreme in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Encyclopedia Brown</a></em> books. The first few pages of every book are word-for-word identical. Chapter 1 is always a case from his father, Chapter 2 is always a case he solves by himself in which he proves that the culprit is Bugs Meaney, and Chapter 3 always features Bugs's attempt at revenge for being foiled in Chapter 2, introducing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Sally</a> (cue more verbatim passages) as the explanation for why said revenge is "attempt to frame Encyclopedia" rather than "beat the crap out of Encyclopedia."
</li><li> Meta example: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ErastFandorin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ErastFandorin">All the World is a Stage</a></em>, the theater director reveals that he writes all his plays based on the same 10 dramatic character archetypes, and the public loves it. The protagonist himself ends up writing a play based on the same formula (but <span class="font-s">IN JAPAN</span>) to make an impression on the actress he fell in love with.
</li><li> The first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books play this fairly straight - Dursleys, Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, Quidditch, Christmas, the big plot issue, end of year feast, everyone goes home. Parts of the formula stay for the later books (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry always starts out at the Dursleys in the books, no matter what</span>) but Rowling then breaks these down as the universe gets darker and more complicated - and Harry matures. By <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, Voldemort takes over the ministry and Hogwarts, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione spend most of the book in pursuit of his horcruxes. They only return to Hogwarts during the latter half when the search leads them there.
</li><li> A lot of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novels</a>, most of which have not been animated, follow a formula when dealing with the entire Brigade: Haruhi gets a hair up her ass about doing some sort of activity. Kyon complains, Koizumi agrees, Nagato says nothing, Mikuru is confused, and they all go along with it. Something strange is going on with whatever activity they are doing, but Haruhi remains oblivious to it, either enjoying whatever they are doing or getting bored. Koizumi and/or Nagato <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">explain whatever is going on</a>, then Koizumi and/or Nagato fixes it, possibly with help from Kyon, though sometimes Mikuru From The Future shows up to settle the matter. In the end Kyon finds out that if the weird event wasn't obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">caused by Haruhi</a>, then it had some connection with her anyway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHauntingOfDrearcliffGrangeSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHauntingOfDrearcliffGrangeSchool">The Haunting of Drearcliff Grange School</a></em>, Charlotte Knowles' father writes detective novels. Amy Thomsett notes that they all follow the same pattern: There's an impossible murder that's given an elaborate non-supernatural explanation in the final chapter, the murder victim is always one of two character types (both female), and the most helpful, handsome, learned man in the supporting cast always turns out to be the murderer.

<div class="indent">Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being under a silvery moon which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.
</div></li><li> The Song Cycles of Vassillian composed by the Great Circling Poets of Arium in the same book. There are 794 of them and they all follow exactly the same pattern:
<div class="indent">The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth from the City of Vassillian a party of five sage princes with four horses. The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise, travel widely in distant lands, fight giant ogres, pursue exotic philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are therefore accomplished.
</div><div class="indent">The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to walk back.
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a></em>: Each story in the series follows this basic formula: A murder occurs. Eve Dallas is called in to investigate the murder. She works the case to figure out who the murderer is. When she does, she goes and gets the bad guy. The series does play around with this formula, like the bad guy might actually get away somehow, the murderer is already identified, or the murderer goes after Eve first. Also, the series focuses on the developing relationship between Eve and Roarke, as well as other characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChicksInChainmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChicksInChainmail">Mathemagics</a></em> discusses how formulaic bodice-ripper romance novels are. One author who writes them under a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PenName">Pen Name</a> just for the money admits to copying and pasting the publisher-mandated sex scenes from one book to the next, and having heroines who differ mainly by hair color.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe">Nero Wolfe</a> books, this and the character interplay between Wolfe and Archie is generally considered one of the big draws of the series. They generally follow a pattern like this: Wolfe gets a case, either because Archie has talked him into accepting a client, because money's low and he's gone hunting for one, or because a matter of honor has compelled him to take the case without payment. The case is almost always a suspicious death that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">despite the attitude of the police</a>, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMurder">most likely murder</a>. Archie is 'given instructions', which usually revolves around either taking a look at the crime scene, interviewing a person of interest and / or getting persons of interest in the case to Wolfe's office so he can interview them. After the above has taken place a couple of times, Inspector Cramer or some other police officer / authority figure shows up to try and bully / cajole information out of Wolfe; it's usually unsuccessful, although Wolfe may throw out an often-ignored hint or play with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>. Another murder  often with the best suspect so far playing the victim  occurs. Wolfe has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> and Archie is often frozen out of the investigation so that Wolfe can employ other operatives<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1hss1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1hss1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1hss1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and so that Archie can't reveal the guilty party to the reader too soon</span> although Archie may have deduced (or at least have strong suspicions) about who the murderer is anyway. One of the other operatives (often Saul Panzer) digs up a vital piece of evidence which clinches the matter, at which point Wolfe summons the suspects and / or the police to his office to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummationGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummationGathering">outline his theory and expose the murderer</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> inspired a series of novels written by show writers Lee Goldberg and later Hy Conrad. In most novels, Natalie introduces Monk and Monk quickly solves an unrelated murder, which is meant to establish Monk's detective skills. Then the main murder plot happens, and Monk accuses someone out of pettiness. Monk determines the real killer, who has an airtight alibi; at first, typically only Natalie believes him, until evidence comes proving Monk is right. That said, the formula is sometimes twisted:
<ul><li> In <em>Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse</em>, the unrelated murder case happens midway through the story, after the investigation for the main murder starts.
</li><li> In <em>Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu</em>, the story ends up being made of three main murder investigations. The first is the Golden Gate Strangler, a serial killer who has attacked three women. Then there comes the subplot of another serial killer, which turns out to be a spree killer trying to hunt down the witness to her murder of an astrologer. Then there's the death of a police officer which turns out to be connected to the reward to bring in the Golden Gate Strangler.
</li><li> In <em>Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop</em>, there is a variant: many of the threads that set up the main murder mystery's plot occur within the first 14 chapters (Monk and Natalie meeting Bill Peschel and Paul Braddock, the two eventual murder victims), but in the first half, there are <em>two</em> unrelated subplot murders that are solved within one chapter: a small university shooting that Monk solves on the spot, and the assassinations of two judges.
</li><li> In <em>Mr. Monk in Trouble</em>, the unrelated murder at the beginning doesn't have Monk even visit the crime scene but identify the killer based on what he's wearing. This gets a callback when Natalie reads an entry in Abigail Guthrie's journal where Monk's great-great-great grandfather Artemis Monk identifies a killer in the same way without ever going to the crime scene or seeing the dead body. The mysteries in that journal turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> for the main plot.
</li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> case happens in the novel <em>Mr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a> and the Two Assistants</em>. While in Los Angeles investigating a murder that Sharona's husband has been framed for, Monk and Natalie meet Ian Ludlow, a bestselling murder mystery author who also consults for the LAPD under an arrangement similar to the one Monk has with the SFPD. Natalie buys a few of Ludlow's novels to read. During the drive back to San Francisco, Monk begins thumbing through the books and is quickly unimpressed when he realizes that Ludlow's books have a predictable formula.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Adrian Monk:</strong> <em>[opens </em>Names Are For Tombstones<em>]</em> The beekeeper did it. <em>[Monk puts that down and picks up another one, </em>Death Works Weekends<em>, reads a few pages, then shuts it]</em> The matador did it. <em>[He picks up </em>Death is the Last Word<em>, reads a few pages, then closes it]</em> The massage therapist did it. <br/><strong>Natalie Teeger:</strong> You only glanced at the first couple of pages. <br/><strong>Adrian Monk:</strong> Ludlow is so heavy-handed he might as well reveal the killer on the cover. The murderer always has a personality quirk that is his or her undoing. <br/><strong>Natalie Teeger:</strong> How would you know? You haven't read to the end of any of his books. <em>[Monk picks up one book and quickly flips through it]</em> <br/><strong>Adrian Monk:</strong> The massage therapist is claustrophobic, so she opened the windows at the crime scene. That's how Detective Marshak knew it was her. <br/><strong>Natalie Teeger:</strong> Thanks for ruining the books for me. <br/><strong>Adrian Monk:</strong> They were lousy anyway. You live more interesting mysteries than Ludlow can make up. <br/><strong>Natalie Teeger:</strong> <em>Those</em> are work. These would have been for enjoyment. <br/><strong>Adrian Monk:</strong> What's enjoyable about reading some contrived mystery where the killer is <em>always</em> the least obvious person who is caught the same way every time? <br/><strong>Natalie Teeger:</strong> Nothing anymore. I can never read an Ian Ludlow book again.
</div><ul><li> It turns out that the reason Ludlow's bookwriting has become so formulaic is because, in a desperate need for new book material, he's turned to committing murders himself and acting like the very killers he writes about in his books: he befriends someone for long enough to study the people in their life, then kills them. Then he drops an orgy of excessive clues left and right that are designed to frame the least likely suspect for the crime. And after that, he writes a book. This includes the murder Trevor was framed for, and a later murder where Ludlow frames Natalie for killing a shoe salesman in San Francisco and making it look like an alligator attack. When Monk gets the evidence needed to catch him, he revels in pointing out that Ludlow, like his fictional killers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">incriminated himself through a personality quirk of his</a>. Namely, that he can't resist signing his own books whenever he goes into a bookstore that sells them. Monk connects him to the murder for which Natalie was framed because he signed books at three stores in San Francisco including one down the block from a pizzeria where the victim ate his last meal, all on a day when Ludlow purportedly claimed he was in Los Angeles.

Virtually all of the book series were about teens going on adventures or solving mysteries, with slight variations on the concept. As such, the books contained very similar themes and portrayals. Characters had platonic love lives, if any at all (rather humorously, this led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys">The Hardy Boys</a> were gay, due to their lack of interest in their nominal girlfriends, preference for male friends, and one brother's close friendship with a boy who disliked girls). Suspense was used to heighten tension, but violence was limited — characters could get knocked out or tied up, but nothing worse than that. Language was tame, and even expressions such as "oh gosh" and "oh golly" were dropped after some readers complained that they were merely euphemisms for "oh god".
</li><li> Piers Anthony's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> novels, by his own admission, tend to follow the same basic formula every time: Random person has random problem, random person goes to the Good Magician to ask a Question about how to solve that problem, random person gets sent on a seemingly arbitrary quest, seemingly arbitrary complications occur, at the end of the story, it turns out that going on the seemingly arbitrary quest solved the original problem, or the character finds out that the problem they thought they wanted solved wasn't actually the real problem, or they actually wanted something different, either way, they get what they "really" wanted and everybody lives happily ever after.

</li></ul></li><li> David Eddings wrote several multi-book series of high fantasy adventure, which were all identical - particularly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em> and its sequel series, <em>The Malloreon</em>. This was because he wanted to see if he could do it and still make it interesting, and in <em>The Malloreon</em>, it actually becomes a plot point when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">the characters note that it seems like they've been through it all before</a> and start discussing it. It is eventually explained the universe became "stuck" when its Purpose was split in two, so people keep acting out the same patterns until things get set to rights - once it is, things can move forward.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarRiceBurroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>: A handsome man of physical strength and skill, of high birth — though he may be ignorant of it, and the reader may be too — travels to far-off land and meets a heroine, beautiful, spirited, and prone to be kidnapped. She is also of high birth, though the hero and reader are even more likely to be ignorant of that, and she may be. He has adventures, several of which revolve about rescuing the heroine, and there are misunderstandings between the two of them. In the end, the misunderstandings are resolved, the dangers are dealt with, and they marry. <br/>Sometimes he diverged from this. The results were often unhappy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodiPicoult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodiPicoult">Jodi Picoult</a>: Her books tend to have the same (general) formula: People (usually centering on the woman) living a normal life (in some New England town), something big happens/happened to them (i.e. husband is cheating, child is arrested) and there ends up being a court case either involving family members (i.e a family member committed a crime) or involving family members suing each other. Usually the court case involves children or teens. Expect one child to be severely ill and wiser than their years. The parents will/already did forget about the other child, if there is one. It is often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>, but is successful because of that (the judge/jury feels sorry for the defendant). Usually there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> near the end. Glaring examples include <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MySistersKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MySistersKeeper">My Sister's Keeper</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandleWithCare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandleWithCare">Handle with Care</a></em>, the latter of which has been criticized for being nearly identical to <em>My Sister's Keeper</em>. Most of Picoult's books written before <em>My Sister's Keeper</em> actually are more fluid with the formula, with <em>Harvesting the Heart</em> not following it at all.
</li><li> A common criticism of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGreen">John Green</a>'s books — all but one or two of them are about a nerdy, highly intelligent teenage boy who has his eye on a quirky, mysterious girl, eventually going on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadTrip">Road Trip</a> where he has a mind-blowing revelation about life. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaultInOurStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaultInOurStars">The Fault in Our Stars</a></em> reverses roles, telling it from the quirky girl's perspective as she falls in love with the nerdy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> who is fawning over her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> tends to be fairly formulaic in overall plot. Though given that several lines in the formula are evidently "Insert creative and unique funny moments here", who cares?
</li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipKDick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s short stories followed the formula: Man invents technology. Technology turns on man. Man fights technology. Technology defeats man. Technology turns on itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostYearsOfMerlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostYearsOfMerlin">The Lost Years of Merlin</a>:</em> There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheciesRhymeAllTheTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheciesRhymeAllTheTime">rhyming prophecy</a> saying that Merlin needs to do something.

In fact, many publishing companies who specialize in romance have their specific formulas, and if you stray too far outside their guidelines, you're not going to get published by them. This allows the reader to treat a new book as a familiar comfort food, differing in the details but not outside the form they've become accustomed to.

Namely: We see them in the house, they get a call from Lord Sugar, they go to some famous building to hear him explain the task, get split into teams, choose a leader/come up with a product/brand/whatever, get split into two sub teams for two tasks (which it splits between every few minutes), they complete the 'task', the day ends, they go to the boardroom to hear the results. And then we get to see the winning team enjoy a treat, the losing team stuck in the Bridge Cafe, three people (including the project manager) end up in the firing line with their strengths and weaknesses outlined and someone eventually get fired (complete with catchphrase and walk to taxi). Cue 'next time on The Apprentice' clip montage.

<ul><li> Starting with Season 4, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UST">UST</a> was finally resolved, those scenes in the formula got switched with Castle and Beckett attempting to hide their relationship from someone. And the plot is always resolved by genre-savvy and there's usually a red-herring genre-not-so-savvy moment where novelist's instinct leads them wrong to justify the continued skepticism of the force as a whole.
</li><li> Another mandatory ingredients: Beckett talks in the interrogation room with Suspect Number 1, tells him with absolute confidence: "That's why you killed her", he denies, surprised, outraged or smug, in the next scene Ryan or Esposito confirms that the Suspect #1 has a rock-solid alibi. Most likely the sequence will be repeated at least once in the same episode, with another suspect(s).

The person details how they've been talking to someone online for a while, but the person either won't video chat with them or won't meet up with them. Nev and Max visit them in their hometown to get more details.

They arrange a meetup with said catfish, who 9 times out of 10 is not the person they say they are (and in some instances may even be the wrong gender).

He would then leave, only to casually drop in a line which revealed he'd spotted a crack in the murderer's plan.
</li><li> The murderer would try and continue with his life, only to be continually haunted by Columbo who would turn up in the most unlikeliest locations, continually pestering the murderer.

All of the stories in this season are considered decent, most fans will have at least one story in this season they consider a classic, and many fans - particularly the BNFs of the 80s - praise the show for settling down into a routine of solid horror stories here; but many others mourn the loss of <em>Doctor Who</em>'s trademark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreRoulette">Genre Roulette</a> in favour of a routine of going to a base on [PLANET] to fight [MONSTER] along with with a band of [3-6] people, one of whom is the commander, and some of whom are working with the monsters and are the real threat.

</li><li> Ask any Classic <em>Who</em> fan what a Classic <em>Who</em> story is supposed to be like, and they will immediately tell you - after a cutaway introducing the characters in this new world, the Doctor and his assistant exit the TARDIS, run into a mild scrape that hints at a bigger mystery, and then get captured while the villains put more of their machinations in motion. Either the Doctor or the assistant sees something scary (after escaping, or while trying to help save the other), which is the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a>, roll credits. The middle two episodes are a lot of time running down corridors and/or getting chased in quarries, while the villains slowly pick off sympathetic guest characters and each other, and the Doctor attempts to get the suspicious locals on his side despite his funny behaviour. In the final episode, most of the villains have been taken care of by guest characters, but the biggest threat remains, and so (after some more running) the Doctor does something mildly sciencey/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFromTechnology">Magic from Technology</a> and saves the day. This was by no means the plot template for all serials, but it certainly feels like it was, being the typical form of the iconic Hinchcliffe era and the Williams era as well as a few Pertwees, early Troughtons and most 80s <em>Who</em>. Both the old and new series have lampshaded this structure on numerous occasions, and the Classic story "Carnival of Monsters" and the New series episode "Heaven Sent" both trap the Doctor in an artificial dimension made up of corridors, a chasing monster and a time loop.

They will usually have someone who has a traditional wedding, someone who has a traditional wedding WITH A TWIST (she's wearing sneakers, they're all going to dance), a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman">Sassy Black Woman</a> who has something unusual (i.e. praise dancers, a rapper), a destination wedding, and a foreign wedding.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em> has the main character go through almost the exact same pattern every episode to find the solutions everybody else misses. This was much truer of <em>House</em> in seasons one through three. After the mass firing at the end of season three, things were mixed up just a bit for a while, returned to normal, but went off the rails (in a VERY good way) once House started seeing dead people. Many episodes still fit into the basic formula of the show from before, but they have also done others that completely break the mold. House's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">moment of realization</a> was even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in one episode, when House stopped talking in the middle of a conversation and the other party said, "You're about to run out of here, aren't you?" He did. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> another time when Cuddy asked him how he was going to come up with the diagnosis, and House said he'd go and talk to Wilson about something completely unrelated.

The searchers usually miss them the first time, and they see an opportunity for rescue but aren't spotted. They fend off depression, a dangerous animal, and/or a medical condition, and are found just hours before death.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerrySpringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JerrySpringer">Jerry Springer</a></em> turned this into an art-form for trash talk shows. Every episode follows a similar format regardless of which subject is being tackled (usually cheating partners or KKK zealots):
<ul><li> Most segments start out innocently enough with the guest talking about how they found out about the show (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">they just happened across it on TV</a>) and start talking about how much they love their boyfriend/girlfriend. The audience appreciatively coos in response, while Jerry plays dumb and acts as if everything is normal.
</li><li> The guest reveals that they've (a) either been cheating on them with someone else, who they've <em>also</em> brought to the show, (b) know that their significant other is cheating on them and is going to confront them on television, or (c) are going to reveal a shocking secret about themselves to their family. At this point, the audience begins to grow increasingly hostile, while Jerry tries to rationalize the situation.
</li><li> If the guest is cheating on their partner, they'll bring out the person they're cheating on him/her with. S/he will yell and scream at the audience that "they don't know" him/her, while the audience grows openly hostile, with several members standing up and threatening to walk down to the stage and assault the person themselves.
</li><li> The aggrieved lover will come out on stage, and 9 times out of 10, a bell will sound in the background, with both or all participants beginning to beat each other as security staff struggle to separate them. If the fight is brief, the bell will likely sound again and the participants will go back to fighting. Eventually, the group is separated and the aggrieved party will sit on the opposite side of the stage, sometimes with a guard sitting between them.
</li><li> During the Q&amp;A session at the end of each episode, expect to see at least one guest insult an audience member and attack them, at least one additional fight, and at least one girl (sometimes two) who accept free beads in exchange for getting up on stage and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">pole-dancing while flashing the audience</a>.
</li><li> Every episode ends with Jerry moralizing the current subject and musing about why people mistreat the ones they love, before telling the audience to love each other and stay safe.

<ul><li> Prior to Gordon's arrival, we get a montage of the restaurant owner's experience serving a test dinner to a number of patrons and learn about their history with the restaurant. At least one of the participants is incredibly neurotic, snarky or both, and there's lots of yelling and screaming in the kitchen.
</li><li> Gordon meets one-on-one with the restaurant owner, who without fail claims that their food quality is "10 out of 10" and is at a loss to understand what's going wrong with their business. Interviews are spliced in from other participants who explain clearly how the business is losing money, and how the owner is too short-sighted to understand what's going on.
</li><li> Gordon arrives for a sample lunch and is met by one of the waitresses, who usually criticizes the restaurant's food and tries to warn Gordon away from certain dishes (or overstates the quality of the food). Gordon proceeds to make snarky jabs at the poor quality of the food, while the servers, chefs and owner get plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReactionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReactionShot">reaction shots</a> as they struggle to deal with what's happening. Expect to see the chef always lose his cool and start getting flustered or angry.
</li><li> Gordon pulls the staff together for a quick post-lunch discussion and tries to yell sense into them, while the chef or owner refuses to admit that anything is wrong and yells back at him. Expect to see waitresses crying and the chef storming out of the kitchen after Gordon lambasts him in front of everyone.
</li><li> A test dinner service is held that night, and Gordon watches in dismay as the cooks quickly lose it under pressure and begin yelling at each other. Gordon conducts an inspection of the food storage and inevitably comes across old/moldy food, raw meat being stored on the same shelf as cooked items, cockroaches, rats, mildew and/or mold. Gordon confronts the chef and cooks, who play dumb and often make the excuse that they were "going to throw it out" or "it was made yesterday", while the owner stares in disbelief.
</li><li> Gordon pulls everyone in again for another meeting and yells at them for their lack of care, before threatening to walk out on them. It is at this point that the owner will have a dramatic change of heart and finally admit that something is wrong while piano music plays in the background. If this doesn't work, expect Gordon to pull together members of the owner's family for an intervention, complete with lots of tears and anguished cries for help.
</li><li> Gordon redesigns the restaurant and begins to give the cooks lessons and how to prepare a handful of signature dishes they can use for the following night's service. Once the next dinner begins, the chefs initially have trouble keeping up with orders but quickly pull things together and get orders out.
</li><li> The staff have learned overnight how to fix their restaurant, and Gordon cautions them to stick to the principles he's taught them before leaving.

</li><li> Every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeAfterPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeAfterPeople">Life After People</a></em>. Two or three prominent cities / buildings and a selection of animals (usually household pets, farm animals and / or pests) and plants around a certain theme are selected. Every episode then jumps forward one day, several days, a week, a month, a year, a century and so forth to show how they cope without human care (spoiler: the buildings eventually collapse or crumble away; the animals and plants usually thrive, albeit undergoing lots of changes in the process) until a point is reached several centuries or millennia in the future where there's nothing left. Each episode also features a brief look into a real-life location which has been abandoned by people to see what effects nature has had on it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer2016">Lucifer (2016)</a></em> can fall into this at times. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> plot line typically goes like this: 1) Someone is murdered (or almost murdered) 2) Lucifer and Chloe investigate the crime that usually relates to a personal problem in Lucifer's life somehow 4) The evidence points to one person but that person didn't do it 5) They figure out that it's actually the person they least suspected. Episodes that are more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> heavy typically won't be as formulaic, however.
</li><li> Tabloid talk show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Maury">Maury</a></em> has a pretty limited set of episodes, e.g. people with congenital defects (or "heroes" as the show often refers to them), paternity tests ("That baby looks <em>nothing</em> like me!"), disrespectful teenagers who are cured of being brats by boot camp ("You don't know me!") and "Jack Hanna brings animals that pee all over the stage". Not only are the topics limited to about a dozen options or so, each topic itself is played strictly to formula: if you've seen one "Who's the daddy?" episode you've seen all of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium">Medium</a></em>: 1) Alison has a dream with an obvious twist which anybody but her would be able to guess. 2) Allison has breakfast with her family and some small but endearing drama develops. 3) Alison meets up with her boss or that cop, and they present a case and she tells them that either a) she's either been dreaming about and which she knows something is wrong or b) there's another more important case which is tangentially related. Alison knows they have the wrong suspect. 4) The small family drama reaches its head. 5) Alison takes some small step to hunting down the killer herself. 6) The police's first suspect proves to be wrong. 7) Alison has her life threatened as a result of her stupidity during step five. 8) Alison survives and solves her mystery. 9) The small family crisis resolves itself. 10) Alison has another dream confirming that everything will be fine now. 11) Alison makes some sort of glib, self-satisfied comment to her husband.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em>. Nearly every episode begins with Jim finding the tape and getting the mission, picking out the photos of the team he's using and then explaining part of the plan to the team in his house while they sit around testing the gadgets they're going to use.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>: While solving a murder is the main plot for most episodes, there are a few episodes in which Monk helps investigate other crimes, such as kidnappings in the season two episode "Mr. Monk and the Missing Granny" and the season three episode "Mr. Monk and the Kid", or a failed murder plot in the season six episode "Mr. Monk and the Daredevil". There are a number of times where the episode is not about the murder itself but about finding evidence to arrest the killer, e.g. "Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert", "Mr. Monk and the Birds and the Bees", or "Mr. Monk and the Genius", and episodes where the murder is related to the main plot, e.g. in "Mr. Monk on Wheels". And some episodes actually start as a totally different type of case, but eventually a murder happens, e.g. a suspected abduction turns into a murder case in "Mr. Monk Gets Hypnotized". Episodes generally follow one of four plot lines:
<ul><li> The killer is known, and how the crime was committed is known. Monk spends the episode trying to find evidence to arrest that person.
</li><li> Monk knows who the killer is, and knows what the motive is, but the killer has a seemingly air-tight alibi. The episode is spent trying to break that alibi and find out how the killer did it.
</li><li> In a number of episodes, the plot involves trying to find out the killer, how the murder was done, and why.
</li><li> In some episodes, the killer's M.O. is known, but not who did it or why.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em> always followed the same formula. There's a murder, and the victim had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">several possible enemies</a>. One of the suspects is Jessica's niece, nephew, long-lost friend or love interest of the same, and the police always zero in on that person. Jessica must then catch the real killer, usually by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">Engineered Public Confession</a> or by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INeverSaidItWasPoison">something only the killer would know</a>. If the murderer's story is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">particularly tragic</a>, it ends with Jessica shaking her head sadly, otherwise there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> cut to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLaughsEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLaughsEnding">Everybody Laughs Ending</a>. The pacing was also always the same. Expect the body to fall at about the 20 minute mark, and the wrongful arrest of the obvious suspect at the 40. On the rare occasion there was a dead body before 15 minutes, there's going to be a second death in the show later. And finally, only once in a blue moon was the last frame of the episode (which is frozen in place with the Executive Producer credit) something other than Jessica alone.

Sure, sometimes it swaps things up (some episodes have the Rangers defeat the monster on foot), but it almost always followed that general formula.
<ul><li> On a series-wide basis, one thing that's almost always present is a ranger's rivalry with one of the enemy generals - there's been 5 cases (<em>Zeo</em>, <em>Turbo</em>, <em>Time Force</em>, <em>Ninja Storm</em> and <em>Jungle Fury</em>) where this wasn't present<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note33gak');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note33gak" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note33gak');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">most of the time, it's with the Red; <em>Wild Force</em>, <em>Dino Thunder</em>, <em>Operation Overdrive</em>, and <em>RPM</em> have it with the Yellow, Black, Blue and Black, and Black rangers respectively; and while <em>Super Megaforce</em> didn't have such a rivalry, it's red Ranger, Troy, had already experienced a rivalry of this sort in the first season</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> The show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em> always seemed to feature the same plot: kid makes mistake, kid must pay for mistake, kid's mistake affects overly righteous parents, righteous parents forces kid to learn from mistake. And to make matters worse, the kids always seemed to suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a> as they would commit that very same mistake in the next episode.
</li><li> Typically, a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RosieAndJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RosieAndJim">Rosie and Jim</a></em> episode goes like this:
<ul><li> The host is writing a new book (John), drawing a new picture (Pat) or writing a new song (Neil)
</li><li> In order to find inspiration for the book/picture/song, they go off on a trip down the canal with the two eponymous ragdolls following them, often times they'll be presented with a problem that prompts them to go on the adventure in the first place and they'll often learn something new about wherever they're visiting.
</li><li> Duck calls Rosie And Jim back to the Ragdoll and they'll play a game related to their adventure before the host comes back and starts writing their new book/drawing their new picture/writing their new song inspired by what happened during the day.

<ul><li> Each episode is broken into segments, with most segments being found in every episode, including "Calls From the Public," "Rock Facts," "A Word With Chester," "Precious Roy's Home Shopping Network" and "It's Almost the End of the Show."
</li><li> Precious Roy segments would also follow the same internal formula: Sifl and Olly introduce the product, during which time Sifl admits to having a specific problem that the product would solve. Olly agrees that Sifl has "serious-ass _____ problems." They take some calls, which cause Sifl to lose his temper and have to be calmed down by Olly. Then they hear from Precious Roy, who spouts a non-sequitur and finishes with his catchphrase, "Suckers!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> has a habit of recycling old character traits and mixing/overlapping them into new crewmen. For instance, each show has featured or at least attempted a do-over of Spock and Bones. Each show features a wet ensign (Chekhov, Wesley, Nog, Kim, Mayweather) who is supposedly representative of Earth's finest. Each show features the Klingons, or some thinly-disguised variant thereof. Each show tended to revolve around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBartender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBartender">bartender</a> after the success of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhoopiGoldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>'s Guinan (famously, the <em>Enterprise</em> series finale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">sidelined the regular castmates</a> in favor of "Chef"). It is also common for <em>Trek</em> series to feature one (or more) character who feels trapped between two cultures.<em>Voyager</em> had the others well-beaten in this respect: It had the Half-Klingon hybrid B'Elanna Torres, the ostracized Native American Chakotay, the former Borg drone Seven of Nine, and the Emergency Medical Hologram.
<ul><li> <em>Voyager</em>, in its bid to succeed in syndication like its predecessor TNG, soon attracted criticism for the formulaic nature of its plots. The series leaned heavily on a particular trifecta: crewman gets stranded on planet, time travel, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">negative space wedgie</a> which attacks the ship — with two or more sometimes occurring in the same episode! Apart from a few exceptions, such as Tom Paris and the Doctor, the characters also tended to run in circles and re-learn the same "lessons" over and over. Janeway learns the importance of holding onto her principles. Tuvok learns to put aside logic and trust his gut. B'Elanna learns to control her temper. Neelix dotes on children. Seven rediscovers her humanity. For the most part, you can view these episodes in any chronological order and not miss a thing.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SFDebris">SF Debris</a> noted that episodes centred around Torres boiled down to one of three plots - she's pissed off, she's broken something and has to fix it, or she wants to screw someone.

A dozen episodes a season of "Eric says something jerk-y, Donna freaks out, both talk to their respective groups, Donna realizes she overreacted, they make up, the end".
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeGentlemenPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeGentlemenPlease">Time Gentlemen Please</a></em> follows the same formula every episode. A plotline is introduced, usually involving a recurring character entering the pub and talking to Al Murray. He attempts to resolve the situation, which usually results in him annoying other characters. Throughout the episode, the characters say their catchphrases, constantly. Somebody tries to touch Lesley's Tigger, which results in Leslie almost beating them up but being bribed free crisps just in time. At some point the plotline is resolved. Usually, all of this takes place within the pub. If there ever was a show that is the archetype of strictly formula (namely being built entirely around catchphrases and one location) this is it.

<ul><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidCom">KidComs</a> follow a pretty strict, formulaic template which can sometimes conflict with a show's premise; for instance, the adult with the most screen time is generally meant to be a buffoonish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultChild">Adult Child</a>, which works when they're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">sculptor</a> or work at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurgerFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurgerFool">Burger Fool</a>, but causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">believability issues</a> if they're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KickinIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KickinIt">karate sensei</a>.

Mulder and Scully are informed, he tells her about existing X-files like this and reveals his crackpot theory; she offers a scientific explanation. The duo travels to the site and encounters several witnesses/survivors. They run around the woods/darkened rooms and bicker a lot. One or more of the survivors are killed in a grisly fashion. If it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> episode, Mulder meets with his current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousInformant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousInformant">Mysterious Informant</a>. Scully does the science but finds nothing. Mulder, meanwhile, witnesses something that completely confirms his earlier theory. The culprit is killed, captured, or destroyed if it's not human. Any evidence the duo uncovered is mysteriously destroyed or not-so-mysteriously confiscated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a>. Scully or Mulder writes a report saying that the evidence of supernatural is inconclusive, and the file is closed.

Since the huge success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven">That's So Raven</a></em>, almost all of their shows have had some teenager(s) living a normal life with a TWIST, with their one same sex friend and one friend of the opposite sex (possibly a future love interest). There's almost always a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">ditz</a> and person who's an absolute jerk, usually because they're a popular kid at school. Also, the star will be (either in-universe or in real life) a singer who sings the theme song of the show and/or gets shoehorned into singing as much as possible in the show.

</li><li> There are some slight variations on the ending—sometimes, like <em>CC</em>, there's a musical montage of the cops and the victim's loved ones.
</li><li> Throughout the episode, from the moment the victim vanishes, we get a time stamp of how long they've been missing—from as little as 27 minutes to as much as 4 days—to heighten the tension and the desperate need to find them.

A lot these are things that are typical of pop songs in general, but there are specific repeated quirks like having the guitar solo reiterate the verse melody note for note (every song on the album) or starting the song with a guitar melody that is repeated vocally in the bridge later on (every song after the first four tracks). Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide">B-Side</a> tracks from the same era tend to do this.

<ul><li> Its first ten years saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanWomensProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanWomensProWrestling">Zenjo</a> become known for having foreign 'outsiders' brutalize the local wrestlers to championship acquisition, especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">tag team</a> competition. Other perpetrators of this formula included Capitol Sport Promotions in Puerto Rico, specifically in matches with Carlos Colon, staring with Canadian\<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeNationality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeNationality">Sudanese</a> champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AbdullahTheButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AbdullahTheButcher">Abdullah the Butcher</a> and that other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan</a> with its "Four Pillars"(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MitsuharuMisawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MitsuharuMisawa">Mitsuharu Misawa</a>, Toshiaki Kawada, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KentaKobashi">Kenta Kobashi</a>, Akira Taue) during the 1990s.

Of course when someone different comes in, such as British chain wrestlers Douglas Williams and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness">Nigel McGuinness</a> or the Capoeira of TaDarius Thomas, a different set of critics will complain about how "awkward" they look and count down the number of shows it takes them to adapt to strong style wrestling.

Unfortunately, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">Good Is Dumb</a>, the common formula is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">The Bad Guy Wins</a> over the baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">power stables</a> only for further division in the victorious group via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">heel face turns</a>.

Almost every episode begins with a member of the Authority, or occasionally the face they're feuding with, cutting a promo, which will usually be interrupted by their enemy, usually setting up both the episode's main event, and the next match. Then the show ends with the main event, which will almost always end with the Authority heel either scoring a cheap victory or a disqualification/no-contest when a different heel interferes. Even in the occasional event that the face actually wins, the episode will almost always end with the Authority beating down the faces and standing tall.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoobs">The Hoobs</a></em>, another UK Henson preschooler show: The Hoobs have a problem which leads to them asking a question. Hubba-Hubba appears on screen to declare that an answer to this question would make an excellent entry in the Hoobipedia. They attempt various solutions, inspired by (in order) asking the Tiddley-Peeps (children), reading an animated story Hubba-Hubba found on Hoobnet, asking Roma the roving reporter, and asking some different Tiddley-Peeps. This final suggestion proves to be the correct one, and the Motorettes sing a song about it before the Hoobs give their report to Hubba-Hubba. Some episodes play with the formula; for instance when the question was "How can we get the Hoobmobile from the island it's stuck on?", it was Roma who talked to the Tiddley-Peeps, because the others were trapped.
</li><li> Quite a few recurring <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> segments, both classic and contemporary, tend to follow a basic plot formula, usually with little or no variation, though there are often exceptions:
<ul><li> The <em>Super Grover</em> segments usually were played out in the same way: Super Grover detects a problem while flying in the air (it could be two kids fighting over something, a boy being afraid to get his hair cut, or even a girl's computer not turning on), then dives down to the "problem," often crashing into something in the landing, and when he is told of the problem, he usually comes up with a ridiculous explanation or solution (sometimes like dancing around going "Wubba Wubba!"), only for the child to solve his or her problem by him/herself. Naturally, Super Grover takes the credit.
</li><li> In at least two of the books, Super Grover made things <em>worse.</em> In one he attempted to save one of his friends from an evil witch that was threatening her. The problem? The witch wasn't real, it was a <em>play,</em> and he utterly ruined it for her. She is shown to be extremely angry at him at the end of the story. In the other, he is fishing with friends when he notices that the boat is leaking very, very slightly. His solution? Pick the boat up out of the water and deposit it back on Sesame Street, wrecking it.
</li><li> The Sesame Street News segments also followed a basic formula to many of them: after the "NEWS FLASH" intro logo and music, we fade to the "news scene" where Kermit the Frog, clad in a reporters' trenchcoat, hat and microphone, is talking to someone off-camera or facing the wrong way or doing something else not related to his duty, before realizing he is on camera and begins his report. Everything goes smoothly as he interviews who he is supposed to, but then halfway into the report, things begin to go wrong (usually with the fairy tale/nursery rhyme being parodied in the sketch not going as it traditionally does), and something bad typically happens to Kermit. The segment then ends with Kermit, usually embarrassed or somewhat shaken up, returning the viewers to the "regularly-scheduled program."
</li><li> <em>Elmo's World</em> has such a strict formula that the main <em>Sesame Street</em> segment has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody">parodied it</a> as "Cookie's World".
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Sesame Tree</em>, the Northern Ireland co-production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em>: Potto and Hilda have a problem (or in season two, Archie arrives with a problem). The Big Whizzing Machine recieves a message from a kid asking about something related to the problem. The Bookworms find a book that sends Hilda to visit a school. Potto uses his computer to watch a relevant <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> "kids around the world" segment and Muppet sketch. Potto gets a phone call from Hilda leading to a segment about how the kids at the school she's visiting deal with the problem. They realise they can now solve their problem, and answer the question.

<ul><li> Joyce Grenfell's "Writer of Children's Books" monologue, in which the author explains how she writes her books and seems entirely unaware she's just described writing the same book twice, only the children have different names and are on holiday in a different place.

<ul><li> Opera librettos often suffer from that (granted, many people dont think the plot is important at all). The 19th century Italian opera often goes like this: the soprano and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenorBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenorBoy">Tenor Boy</a> are in love, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSoundsDeep">Evil Sounds Deep</a> romantic rivals plot, the leads make mistakes and fall victim to the plots.
<ul><li> An especially blatant example is Luigi Illica with his librettos for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AndreaChenier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AndreaChenier">Andrea Chenier</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tosca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tosca">Tosca</a></em> (the latter in collaboration with Giuseppe Giacosa). In the late 18th century, the heroine is in love with a revolutionary artist, a high-ranked official secretly obsesses over the heroine, orders the artists arrest and presents the girl with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">Scarpia Ultimatum</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LEGO">LEGO</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a></em> in its early years ('01-'03). Whenever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a> starts an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">it went downhill in '04</a> topic on an online forum, someone always points out that all of those years followed the same formula: the six heroes are a given - the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> unleashes something bad - the village elders somehow know all about said bad things - heroes collect stuff - they go underground to defeat the current boss. Thankfully later years did away with this concept, and gave justification for the elders' secret knowledge. This argument is also frequently brought up when someone berates <em>Bionicle</em>'s "replacement" line, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/HeroFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/HeroFactory">Hero Factory</a></em> for being too darn formulaic and predictable, though in the latter's case, that was the point, since LEGO wanted to avoid another overly-complex and difficult to follow storyline.
<ul><li> One of the <em>Bionicle</em> comics from 2003 even lampshaded the stories becoming a little formulaic:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Lewa:</strong> Has anyone else noticed that every time we go underground, something really bad happens?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Tahu:</strong> Yes, Lewa, we have all noticed.
</div><ul><li> The toys also changed noticeably back then (it was part of a general shift at Lego due to bankruptcy). <em>Bionicle</em> toys started shifting a lot away from the rest of Lego, with tons of unique, space-filling parts that meant that they couldn't be rebuilt into many things. That took a lot of the wonder and excitement out of it.
</li><li> Another entry for the toys is the dreaded "Inika build", named after the Toa Inika sets from 2006. Almost all Toa and various other canister sets released between '06 and '09 followed the same general body-plan, using mostly the same LEGO pieces, while earlier series tended to variate the builds every year or so. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/HeroFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/HeroFactory">Hero Factory</a></em> did away with this almost entirely with its second set-line.

</li><li> <em>Ace Combat 5</em> also plays with the formulaic mission progression - as in <em>04</em>, the first twelve or so missions of the game involve pushing the enemy out of your country, followed by invasion of their country. By the 18th mission (which was the last level of <em>04</em>), you're pushing deep into enemy territory... but it doesn't feel as climactic as the previous game's 18th mission. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then you get surprised with mission <em>18+</em>, and it turns out you've still got a third of the game to go.</span>

The series is really ambiguous as to whether or not a given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> (<em>Doom RPG</em> series, <em>Final Doom</em>, the first two novels, etc.) is taking place concurrently or on its own timeline, with the exception of <em>Doom 3</em> which is most certainly its own timeline.
</li><li> Most 32-map long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mods</a> for <em>Doom II</em> ape the original game's level progression: the first third of the levels is set in a futuristic high-tech base; the second third is set in cities, castles and other "Earth" locations; the final third is set in Hell. Also, map 7, just like the original, typically involves killing Mancubuses and Arachnotrons, and the final level typically involves a boss fight against something that launches monster-spawning cubes and which requires precisely-aimed rockets fired down a shaft of some sort to damage it. The only real deviation from the formula is that the secret levels are actually connected to whatever bare-bones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plot</a> the mod has, rather than the completely random <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein3D">Wolfenstein 3D</a></em> interlude from the original game.
</li><li> Monster closets in these mods also follow the same general formula, in that 9 times out of 10 they are filled with as many Revenants as possible and open as soon as you grab either a key or a helpful item, which will likely happen every five minutes. Apparently the only way to make a level harder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty">is to spawn a million Revenants in it</a>.
</li><li> The 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> actively invokes this trope as part of the plot, by claiming that all of the Doomguy's exploits are part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">Cycle of Revenge</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a> situation where his spirit is inextricably bound to fighting demons, and that his constant forays to Hell and back are part of a cosmic balancing act to counteract the forces of the underworld. The reboot itself also throws copious amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> at the plot itself, with Doomguy being subtly characterized as someone who's fed up with the constant machinations of the surviving people around him and the demons regarding him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> in-universe for his actions against them (with it being implied that this has happened many, many times before).

</li><li> In all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EtrianOdyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a></em> games except the fourth and sixth, you're the guide of a new team of explorers determined to explore the secrets, wonders <em>and</em> dangers of the Yggdrasil Labyrinth. Whether you're climbing it upward or going downward varies, but in all cases you're exploring six strata, with the first five being mandatory to finish the adventure and the sixth being a formidable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> only for the bravest (or craziest) team. The fourth game shakes it up by having the team travel across the world <em>towards</em> the fabled tree, venturing through four overworld lands (each with its own stratum) in the process. The sixth game does the same thing except the explorers are going <em>around</em> the tree before getting in.
</li><li> Similarly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series follows a similar set of story beats: the hero - usually but not always a Vault Dweller - must leave their home which, through external circumstances, they cannot return to. They must travel through the Wasteland, recruiting companions along the way, to find what they're looking for: either something that will save their home or a lost family member, or both. They can help struggling towns, join themed factions, and complete a number of side quests. Along the way, a larger threat presents itself, and by the time the hero finds what they're looking for, it in some way has been rendered invalid by the larger conflict. Ultimately, the hero takes charge of whatever faction they choose and decide the conflict once and for all. Of all the games, only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> strays from this, and even they keep the main beats (searching for an artifact, side quests, goofy side factions, larger conflict) but changes up the details.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> has a few plot templates that it tends to revisit.

</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby">Kirby</a></em> platform games (among them <em>Kirby's Adventure</em>, <em>Kirby's Return to Dream Land</em>, and <em>Kirby Triple Deluxe</em>) follow a distinct formula. Popstar, or occasionally a series of other planets, is endangered or inconvenienced in some way and Kirby heads off to stop it. The first world is always a grassland world, and island and snow worlds are also commonly seen. Levels are usually connected via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel">Hub Level</a>. In most cases, the world names are alliterative and spell out a plot-relevant acronym (V-I-B-G-Y-O-R, C-R-O-W-N-E-D, F-L-O-W-E-R, etc.) After defeating what appears to be the final boss, the plot begins to thicken and it turns out that Kirby's attempts to fix things have actually made them significantly worse. The player then faces the real final boss, sometimes after an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedShmupLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedShmupLevel">Unexpected Shmup Level</a>, and the day is saved and everyone goes home.

<ul><li> Each dungeon in the series is typically preceded by being forced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneTrueSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneTrueSequence">perform some task in the Overworld in order to open the door or access the dungeon</a>. The dungeons themselves follow the pattern of "Enter dungeon, defeat the miniboss to get new item (or possibly just finding the item in the dungeon and using it to beat the miniboss), use new item to defeat boss, use new item to open/get to next dungeon, lather, rinse, repeat".
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">A Link to the Past</a></em> onwards, almost all console games (as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">A Link Between Worlds</a></em> which are handhelds) start with a quest for three plot coupons, followed by a storyline twist that (depending on the game) might lead to exploring 3, 5 or 7 additional dungeons before meeting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Before or after the plot twist, the Master Sword may be collected. The NES and handheld games, as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">Majora's Mask</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em>, showcase instead a quest for an even number of Plot Coupons (4-8) that is carried over through the entire adventure. Subversions happen at times, though, as in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em> having an extra dungeon <em>after</em> the main four, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheMinishCap">The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap</a></em> having one more as well due to a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">Your Princess Is in Another Castle!</a> in one of the earlier dungeons.
</li><li> Aonuma and Miyamoto went out of their way to change up the Zelda formula for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>. Not only is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonTown">the rest of the overworld dungeon-like</a>, most of the dungeons themselves sport the format of a more compact space, but a higher density in puzzles, enemies and obstacles. This is best appreciated with the first three dungeons, whose goal of completion isn't even on the Plot Coupons (you <em>do</em> collect some in the first two, but finding Zelda is the main focus). Also, half the boss fights take place outside the conventional dungeons - this includes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the airborne battle against a Bilocyte-controlled Levias, the finale against Ghirahim, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> and all three</span> battles with the Imprisoned. Also, the first fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ghirahim</span> breaks formula even further—you actually can't use the dungeon's item (the Beetle) to even inflict damage on this guy, let alone defeat him. Straight-up swordplay time!

This means there are fewer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">Broken Bridges</a> and linearity than in previous installments.

Every so often this unlocks a new world, you fight Bowser three times including the final battle, some form of coin collecting mission is involved somewhere and you can always reach the final battle with around half the stars/shine sprites you need for 100% completion, although it gives you a shorter ending.

<ul><li> So far with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">the Ace Attorney series</a>, you have:
<ul><li> A case where either the lawyer the player controls being new, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">gaining amnesia</a> or otherwise rusty who covers a case of utmost importance that leads to a plot point that will become very important later on. The culprit is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseWhodunnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseWhodunnit">shown in the intro</a> in addition to being completely obvious. Justified in that this is the obligatory Tutorial Mode.
</li><li> Two cases that are almost always unrelated to said plotpoints from the first case the player has to solve, one of which involves defending/prosecuting someone famous or is otherwise very high profile.
</li><li> Another case that either related to the regulars or the player, will almost always throw back to the plot point in the aforementioned first case and usually has something to do with some kind of dilemma the regular in question has, solving it by the end.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Charley the plant. Or (step)ladders.</a>
</li><li> Sometimes a bonus case that either further relates to, or shoots a throwback of, the aforementioned plot point.
</li><li> Sometimes having one of the regulars be accused of some kind of crime the player will have to defend them for or prosecute against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with an exception or so that the regular had <em>really</em> did it</span>, which may overlap with points 1-3.
</li><li> At least one villain of the final case is <em>always</em> pure evil.
</li><li> The same is always done with all the characters too, as they will always be one of the following:
<ul><li> Normal, uninvolved: usually an assistant or protagonist with wacky hair. (e.g. Phoenix, Maya, Trucy, etc.)
</li><li> Enemy prosecutor/detective; aggressive, has a defining characteristic (e.g. famous guitarist Klavier, coffee addict with visor Godot, German sadist with a whip Von Karma, etc. etc.)
</li><li> Dim Judge: only serves to give you a game over, always take the side of the obvious big bad and give the defense/prosecution an excuse to spell everything out.
</li><li> Normal, bland; usually defendant or common witness who is uninteresting (but still has a wacky personality), only exists so you have a case or so you have more than one person to tear apart in court. Only notably subverted for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Matt Engarde, who is actually the villain hiding behind a dumb persona.</span> (e.g. attention seeking Larry Butz, who only occasionally proves useful).
</li><li> Minor but antagonistic; obviously guilty of <em>something</em>, if there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">a reveal</a> of their actions/past/M.O. they'll serve as a red herring for the real killer or padding out plot. (e.g. Wendy Oldbag claims to be a key witness, actually only a time wasting, attention seeking old gossip in all of her appearances).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>: behind it all, obviously guilty not far into court questioning, will quickly jump between "innocent" and "angry" emotions, will always pull the evidence card on you even though they confess with their exaggerated responses - for some reason, changing back to innocent mode and demanding evidence instantly removes all suspicion. Almost always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">hoist by their own petard</a> by confession only, whether it's an unintentional (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>) or intentional <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(e.g. Engarde confessing for protection)</span>.

Each archetype has its own sliding scale of variations, and types may overlap or combine depending on the size of a given game's cast, but it's very rare indeed for any of the company's games to feature a love interest who can't be easily and accurately identified as one of the seven - often before the game is even out.
</li><li> The later books released for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChoicesStoriesYouPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ChoicesStoriesYouPlay">Choices: Stories You Play</a></em> have turned into this from April 2019, onward. Each new series is released every month, always stars a female protagonist and each one is heavily (if not, purely) romance-based. There are three love interests for the main character: a white male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">that is usually forced on our protagonist and receives the most screentime</a>, a less prominent second male love interest that usually fits the role of "best friend" and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">token female love interest</a> that receives the least screentime (and when she <em>does</em> appear, she's usually paywalled). The plot revolves about something generic involving the protagonist (reporting for a news station, being a singer, visiting family for a summer vacation, attending a bachelorette party, parenthood etc.) that could have worked just as well with a male protagonist (but every "gender-locked" book always has to have a female protagonist for some reason). Each book has reused character designs for many characters (even the <em>main character</em>) and each book is a standalone.

<ul><li> Mario and Jeffy, and sometimes Rosalina, sitting on the couch with Jeffy doing something annoying, then they talk for a while. Throw in some stuff in there, like Mario taking Jeffy to someplace like McDonald's, Jeffy getting a new toy, you get the idea. Then Jeffy causes some sort of bad thing that contributes to the plot, and Mario has to fix it in time.

Then there's more filler where they ask Chef Pee Pee for help or try to fix it or Brooklyn T. Guy comes over or something, and to top it all off, the video ends with a plot twist spoiler or, to a lesser extent, another savage joke. In the case of the "KEN" videos, Cody's imaginary boyfriend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Barbie">Ken</a> gets lost or is split from Cody, which causes him to break down into tears, and Junior and Joseph try to fix whatever happened that caused Cody to cry uncontrollably.

<ul><li> The Adventures of Captain Laserbeam start with the Captain doing some bit of charity work for Apex City only to get called to action by the Adventurekateers. With the Adventurekateers, Captain Laserbeam rattles off various possible villains of the week trying to work out who actually is there, in the process going through various random bantering with the Adventurekateers. Teaming up with other heroes is discussed, as is the Adventurekateers going into action and being flatly rebuffed before Captain Laserbeam goes after the villain himself. Villain puts Captain Laserbeam in a deathtrap, only for the various ramblings of the Adventurekateers to give the Captain a burst of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">Heroic Resolve</a>.

</li><li> Down in Moonshine Holler starts with Banjo Bindlestuff and Gummy riding the rails to the wherever the Hobo Princess was sighted last. There, Banjo sees a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> he may or may not initially mistake for the Hobo Princess he seeks. He seeks to help her with her problems, but runs into the dilemma of whether or not to access the vast wealth he renounced, knowing it would doom his chances with the Hobo Princess, and having to resolve the problems in the Hobo Way. Upon doing so, the saved Damsel gives him a kiss on his sooty cheek, invites him to stay with her, only for Banjo to politely refuse and continue his journey. Also, at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a>, Banjo will insist he absolutely is <em>not</em> vanished millionaire Jasper Manorlodge.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Creepypasta">Creepypasta</a> tend to be fairly similar to each other, largely due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">Follow the Leader</a> being in play. This is especially notable in the case of the Video Game creepypasta genre, which copy so heavily from the most famous stories that they are all nearly the same. Expect to see the story begin with the main character buying a beat-up old copy of an old game they played as a kid while experiencing a bout of nostalgia, then find that the content on this particular copy is unusually dark or violent. Expect to see bodies of water replaced with blood by default and for the main character to assume everything is a glitch at first, only to realize everything is caused instead by some kind of supernatural force. These stories ended up being so similar to each other that several creepypasta-hosting sites outright disallow them.
</li><li> Fandango's <em>Brian the Minion</em> shorts follow the same basic formula: The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DespicableMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DespicableMe">minion</a> sits down to watch a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Universal">Universal</a> movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">old</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretLifeOfPets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSecretLifeOfPets">new</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Minions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Minions">Kevin, Stuart, and Bob</a> come in and disrupt his experience, causing Brian to get angry.

<ul><li> Opening skit that makes an extended joke about the movie that will be lampooned throughout the review; may (or may not) contain an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter">Original Character</a> of his.
</li><li> "Hel-looo, I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to!"
</li><li> What follows is a plot summary of the film, typically glossing over any subplots, with jokes inserted at every major plot point, with usually three<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12rs2o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12rs2o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12rs2o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">no more than five</span> more skits at around the middle to close to the end of the video.
</li><li> In certain reviews, there will be a skit involving his original characters at strategic points; often entirely unrelated to the film in question.
</li><li> Many pop-culture references, internet memes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">lame puns</a>, jokes related to the actors in the movie<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note132bma');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note132bma" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note132bma');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">even if they have nothing to do with the actual movie he's currently <em>reviewing</em></span>, jokes lambasting the writers/actors/directors/etc., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObligatoryJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObligatoryJoke">will be made</a>.
</li><li> If the movie is particulairy heinous, he might have a skit or two in which he rants at the writers/actors/directors/Hollywood in general, and so on, for not putting any effort into their craft/being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a>/only caring about money, etc. Unlike the rest of the video, this will be played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">completely seriously</a>.
</li><li> After the plot summary/review is over, he makes a short critical appraisal of the film, e.g., "The moral isn't <em>bad</em> for kids, but the acting was terrible and the jokes were really lame", ending it with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Incredibly Lame Pun</a> relating to the film.
</li><li> "I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to!"
</li><li> Finally, there will be a short wrap-up skit tying into, or finishing off, the skit from the beginning. If the skit involves his original characters, it might end in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> and continue on in the next review.

Then the Warners would show up and begin bothering the person.
</li><li> The Buttons and Mindy shorts were extremely formulaic. The parents leave their preschool child Mindy in the yard while they go out for some reason with no supervision other than Buttons the dog. Mindy gets out of the yard and starts following some random thing, while Buttons gets into danger trying to protect his charge. Eventually Mindy ends up right back where she started from, where the parents find the two and see no evidence that their child has been out and about and considerable evidence that Buttons have been misbehaving in some manner, getting the dog in trouble.
<ul><li> This was deliberately lampshaded in <em>Mesozoic Mindy,</em> where all the dialogue except for a few key words was reduced to grunts: "Buttons! UG Mindy! No OOG tarpit!". At the end of the episode, Buttons fell into the tarpit while protecting Mindy, resulting in him getting scolded.
</li></ul></li><li> Chicken Boo: Various people have an issue. Someone with "Boo" in their name is called forth to deal with said problem.

Her family tries to talk her down, but only succeeds in making her angrier. Eventually she (still literally) explodes, leaving the house in shambles. She then immediately reverts to normal as either the problem fixes itself, or she easily fixes it, and waltzes off like nothing happened.

<ul><li> Five seconds of an invisible Casper riding a bike, playing with a yoyo, etc., he fades in.
</li><li> Casper's lonely, so he tries to befriend people, who run off screaming "A GHOST!".
</li><li> Casper meets a small child or animal, often helping them out of a jam.
</li><li> Casper and the friend play. Sometimes the friend discovers Casper's a ghost and runs off afraid, leaving Casper unhappy.
</li><li> A large baddie threatens the little friend, so Casper appears, demanding, "You leave my friend alone!"; so the baddie runs off in fear. All ends well.

</li></ul></li><li> It does have a continuity/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>, but the general formula of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em> is followed in a strict pattern: Danny and co. have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">personal problem</a>, a ghost appears and somehow meddles in their personal problem, Danny goes ghost and beats the crap out of it, sends it to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone">Phantom Zone</a>, and solves the personal problem, usually inspired by the battle.
<ul><li> Or, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">to put it in Danny's own words</a>:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Danny:</strong> There's a rhythm to these things. Ghosts attack, we exchange witty banter, I kick ghost butt, and we all go home having learned a valuable lesson about honesty, or some such nonsense.

<ul><li> One of the most gratingly obvious examples of this trope in preschool-aimed TV is the British series <em>Boo!</em> which adheres to the exact same format every episode. The only difference between each episode is the setting, where the viewer has to play a "game" similar to hide and seek and find the eponymous main character, a blue puppet... thing... that seems to have the power to transform to match its settings the third time it is "found". Boo's three friends, the stuffed animals Growling Tiger, Laughing Duck and Sleeping Bear, also tag along Every. Single. Episode. It then ends with one of a few stock songs that teach the viewers about colours, sounds, etc. And then Boo's hiding again and the narrators say, "We have to find him next time when we all play BOO!" However, for all these shows this trope is justified since it has been proven children around a certain age generally learn best through repetition.
</li></ul></li><li> The general story for each episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em>; Urpgor invents a device for Zordrak to help capture the stone, Sgt Blob and his men are sent to the Land Of Dreams with device in hand, the Urpneys steal the stone but screw things up (either due to their incompetance, the heroes' intervening or some other horrible twist of luck) and the Noops retrieve the stone from them just in time to prevent Zordrak sending nightmares to the Land Of Dreams. Oh and Frizz moans something for the final line. A handful of exceptions exist (usually when Zordrak finds a method of sending nightmares different from stealing the stone) but they are outweighed by the usual formula.
</li><li> Nearly every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> starts with the Eds goofing around or engaged in one of Eddy's shady business ventures. Then they stumble upon some other distraction, usually an opportunity for Eddy to scam, impress, or mess with one or more of the other cul-de-sac kids. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> as Eddy drags Ed and Edd into his scheme and the three suffer a number of humiliations and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>.

Various pop culture characters and people will turn up - in a cutaway or just randomly in an episode - and be there for the sake of the reference. Often they will do something outrageous (drugs, violence, rape, death, get a horrible illness...) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptTheCutie">that they would never do in their own universe</a>. In both cases the reference and the shock value alone are usually sufficient enough as a joke. Other scenes will be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Overly Long Gag</a> that goes on for several seconds or minutes and will be nothing but one or two characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">just repeating the same activity over and over again</a> (Peter rubbing his wounded knee, Peter fighting Ernie the chicken, a clip of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty">Conway Twitty</a>...). Oh yes, and at various points an anthropomorphic animal will interact with humans in a realistic situation, the joke being: "Oh, that's a talking penguin/sheep/dog/elephant".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em> goes by this formula: Something in Timmy's life sucks, so he makes a wish to change it. It works out great at first, but eventually has unexpected consequences that usually put everyone in big danger, and Timmy for one reason or another is unable to wish things back to normal. So he and his fairies spend the rest of the episode trying to find a way to fix whatever's preventing him from wishing things right again, or finding another way to fix the problem, and save the day just in time. In the end, Timmy learns an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">important life lesson.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">And then forgets it.</a>
<ul><li> And then there's the movie specials. Every movie would involve Cosmo and Wanda (and in more recent specials, Poof) being separated from Timmy, but they get back together in the end.

Someone else gets the frog. The ferret tries to get the frog back from whoever took it. The ferret manages to get the frog. However, the ferret ultimately fails to eat the frog anyway as it gets returned to its home pond.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Grojband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Grojband">Grojband</a></em>: Each episode follows a certain pattern. Some new music gig opportunity shows up and Corey and the gang announce that there going to play the gig in question, Trina overhears and tries to ruin it, a problem comes up, Corey and the gang make Trina "Go Diary"(Make her feel a certain emotion strong enough to make her write it down in her diary)They steal the diary(or sometimes it just somehow falls into Corey's hands) They play a song based on what the center of the episode was about, The Problem is resolved and Corey gives the band a parody of an inspirtational Speech and Corey says "Thanks for coming out everyone!" and closes a garage door symbolizing the end of the episode.
</li><li> In season 1 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hero108" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hero108">Hero: 108</a></em>, a typical episode follows this pattern: a new animal species therorize the humans, Commander ApeTrully attempts to make peace with the animal king by offering them a gift of gold, the animals usually refuse the gift and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDude">capture him</a> and he calls for First Squad with his device. First Squad arrive on the location where he's captured on their turtle tanks and there they fight off the animals and then either: they refuse to give up and a contest takes place, in which the animals show their abilities and at least one member of First Squad must defeat them or First Squad help them with a certain problem or make them realise something. At the end, the animal king joins Big Green and often gets a certain job in the base. There are quite a few episodes which deviate a bit from the formula and season 2 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">stops following it completely</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em>. Gadget receives a classified assignment in the form of an exploding message from the chief of police. The message blows up in the chief's face after Gadget is done reading it. His niece, Penny, and dog, Brain, secretly get involved in the mission. Brain tries to keep Gadget alive from the assassins out to get Gadget, who in turn mistakes Brain for a criminal, while helping the villain agents he thinks are doing innocent civilian deeds. Meanwhile, Penny snoops around, gets in danger or captured and tied up, gets rescued or free, and ultimately solves the case. Gadget receives credit for the case that his niece had solved.

Tony Stark creates some fantastic new invention, the Mandarin has it stolen, his minions play with it or chat, Iron Man's team is watching TV, they get into action, Iron man saves the device and saves the day.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em> follows a plot formula, though it is seasonal rather than just episodic.

The story arc always culminates in a finale, in which the villains, after a long string of failures, suddenly get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">everything they need</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory">almost succeed with their plans until finally defeated</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest">Johnny Test</a></em> largely follows the formula of "his super-genius twin sisters invent something" &gt; "Johnny uses it" &gt; "something goes horribly wrong". Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfReason">Voice of Reason</a> is a talking dog.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em> went mostly like this: Kaeloo suggests a game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Mr. Cat</a> does horrible stuff to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Quack Quack</a>, Kaeloo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkingOut">Hulks Out</a> and beats Mr. Cat up. And during all this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Stumpy</a> does random stupid and/or crazy things. This is lampshaded in the final episode of Season 1, which was ironically just before Season 2 started and the show stopped being formulaic.
<ul><li> In-universe, the Mr. Coolskin comic books which Stumpy reads. While the audience doesn't get to see the story, the show's characters point out that all the books have almost identical plotlines.

</li><li> Many pairings between Speedy Gonzales and Sylvester (including "Speedy Gonzales", "Canery Woes", and "Here Today, Gone Tamale") involve starving mice wanting to get cheese from a factory, building, or ship being guarded by Sylvester, leading one of them to get help from Speedy Gonzales, who's friends with his sister (to which another mouse will reply, "Speedy Gonzales is friends with everybody's SEE-STER!"). This was repeated odd times with Daffy, though variations were more common.

</li><li> Another common formula is one of the main characters having a problem, and going to each of her friends in turn looking for a solution.
</li><li> The <em>entire series</em> is run on the following formula: Start out the Season with a 2-Part Story where the ponies are faced with a major threat, spend the next 22 episodes delving in hijinks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> stories, then end the Season off with another 2-parter where the ponies are faced with another major threat.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a> cartoons have gotten an unfair reputation as being this, but while that does apply to the bulk of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamousStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamousStudios">Famous Studios</a> shorts, this is surprisingly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">not</a></em> the case with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FleischerStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FleischerStudios">Fleischer Studios</a> Popeye cartoons. Despite the notoriety of the spinach cliche and the characters love triangle, more than half of their shorts eschew the latter formula or have some clever variation of it.

"Lets Celebrake" is completely devoid of conflict, as Popeye lets Olive and Bluto go out together so Popeye can take Olive's grandmother out for New Years Eve. And on top of that, there are 19 of the Fleischer Popeyes where he doesn't eat the spinach, or spinach is absent altogether.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note164gd1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note164gd1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note164gd1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The shorts in question are "Never Kick A Woman", "Hospitaliky", "Lost and Foundry", "I Like Babies and Infinks", "Popeye the Sailor and the Jeep" and its similarly named follow-up "Popeye the Sailor Presents Eugene the Jeep", "Cops Is Always Right", "Leave Well Enough Alone", "Wotta Nitemare", "Never Sock a Baby", "Nurse Mates", "Puttin on the Act", "Wimmin is a Myskery", "I'll Never Crow Again", "Olive Oyl and Water Don't Mix", "Flies Ain't Human", "Pest Pilot", "Child Psykolojiky", and "Olive's Sweepstakes Ticket".</span>

Sadly, they are often poorly done and prevent the episodes from setting up any atmosphere, partly thanks to the power-up scenes that go into each one.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> plots tend to follow a formula; a character has a conflict, initial attempts to resolve the conflict fail and eventually characters trying to resolve the conflict leads to a bizarre confrontation with a supernatural, ultra-powerful and/or over-the-top obstacle or monster.

Leah and Zac are doing something, then Leah calls Shimmer and Shine, who are in Zahramay Falls also doing something, and fly on their magic carpet to the human world. The genies work to help Leah with whatever she wants to do, along with granting the wishes she makes, but since they're still genies in training, they take her wishes differently and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">too literally</a>.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> isn't a strictly formula show, there is a pattern in many episodes.
<ul><li> The creators have a lot of material to work off of with their characters, so what usually happens is that a member of the Simpsons family (usually Bart or Homer) purposefully or inadvertently destroy the life of a secondary character and are then driven by guilt to help them, though it isn't always the fault of the family. Sometimes the character will even end up staying at the Simpsons' home until their life is put back in order. Some examples include: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS1E12KrustyGetsBusted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS1E12KrustyGetsBusted">Krusty Gets Busted</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E3WhenFlandersFailed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E3WhenFlandersFailed">When Flanders Failed</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E6LikeFatherLikeClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E6LikeFatherLikeClown">Like Father, Like Clown</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E16BartTheLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E16BartTheLover">Bart the Lover</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E22TheOttoShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E22TheOttoShow">The Otto Show</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E24BrotherCanYouSpareTwoDimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E24BrotherCanYouSpareTwoDimes">Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E22KrustyGetsKancelled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E22KrustyGetsKancelled">Krusty Gets Kancelled</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E13HomerAndApu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E13HomerAndApu">Homer and Apu</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E19SweetSeymourSkinnersBaadasssssSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E19SweetSeymourSkinnersBaadasssssSong">Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song</a>". And that is just from the first five seasons, as it gets more prevalent in later seasons, to the point where it is the basis for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>.
</li><li> The formula "the Simpsons visit X state/country/continent" is used frequently, often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> with Homer announcing, "The Simpsons are going to X!"
</li><li> A number of episodes, from all eras of the show, involve Homer and Marge breaking up, or nearly so, over something especially boorish, selfish and thoughtless that Homer does. Occasionally there's a variation in which mutual stubbornness is the cause. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">inevitably reconcile</a> by the conclusion.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>, <em>The Itchy and Scratchy Show</em>, also revolves around the strict formula of Itchy playing psychotic pranks on Scratchy that inevitably leave him comically disemboweled or killed. The show seems to poke fun at cartoon writers' inability to diverse from the formula, with several episodes revolving around the cartoon taking a new direction or gimmick, and being significantly poorer in quality.
</li><li> Many episodes also feature Homer getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewJobEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewJobEpisode">new job.</a> He's been an astronaut, voice actor, inventor, etc.
</li><li> On later seasons, a good amount on episodes are based on one member of The Simpsons (and a few times the whole familiy or a side character) meeting a new character voiced by a Special Guest Star, who has a heavy 2010s personality that makes sharp contrast with the Simpsons' 90s personalities. Everything comes down to a climax, and the character gets a reason for never being seen again.

Celebrities will randomly appear and be humiliated, often by dying in horribly violent death. The same will inevitably happen to Kenny, though he will return to life following the end of the episode. The entire town will get involved in a media frenzy, hype or public outrage, only Stan and Kyle remain the voice of reason and provide an aesop or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> near the end.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpecialAgentOso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpecialAgentOso">Special Agent Oso</a></em>: Oso does a training assignment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">and fails</a>. He is then called away to help a child by Mr. Dos and Paw Pilot assigns Oso "three special steps" to complete the task. Paw Pilot then starts singing about the mission as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyAcidSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyAcidSequence">a strange music video</a> is shown. When he arrives, Oso follows the steps carefully when helping the child, needing the audience's help for very simple tasks. As the final step is completed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">in the nick of time</a>, Oso returns to complete his training exercise, using the knowledge he got from his mission to earn his training award.

The episode finishes off with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">corny one-liner.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperWhy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperWhy">Super Why!</a></em> is extremely formulaic even for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentShow">Edutainment Show</a> aimed at little kids. In every episode: One of the kids will have a (mundane) problem; the Super Readers gather in the clubhouse to discuss it; they (magically) choose a book to find the answer; they enter it in their "Y-Flyers"; they read the story and decide to help its characters; they do it in the SAME order (first Alpha Pig, then Wonder Red and/or Princess Presto, and finally Super Why, each one giving a spelling/reading lesson in the process with the help of "Super You" -the audience) and then solve the story by changing its ending (by swapping a word in the text); they then return to the clubhouse, where, with the 'Super Letters' they gathered in their Super Duper Computer along the way, they spell a phrase that gives the answer to their problem as well. And then they dance the same victory dance. It's so repetitive that they use the same animation and catchphrases all the time!
</li><li> The 1987 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> series follows this formula in many episodes that don't involve Shredder and Krang causing havoc with their fully powered Technodrome or appearances of minor villains. Most episodes involve Shredder and Krang steal a state-of-the-art equipment or a power source which the turtles defend and save the day.
</li><li> Seasons 8-16 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasAndFriends">Thomas &amp; Friends</a></em> followed a similar format. An engine is given a job to do, but something stops them from doing the job right, either by taking a shortcut, doing something different, or adding something to make it seem better. After doing this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">three times</a>, everything goes downhill, Sir Topham Hatt scolds them ("You have caused confusion and delay!"), and they proceed to correct their mistake. The job is finished in the nick of time, and ends with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLaughsEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLaughsEnding">Everybody Laughs Ending</a>.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Thundercats">ThunderCats (1985)</a></em> episodes followed the formula of Mumm-ra transforming and hatching his evil plan, Lion-O using his sword's Sight Beyond Sight ability, getting into trouble with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> that necessitates using the Sword of Omens to call upon the others and then taking the problem down with the combined team.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> can be summed up as this: Cat and Mouse chase each other until Tom (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">or Jerry in some cases</a>) loses. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a> (creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em>) sums the formula in the funniest way:
<div class="indent"> "Tom and Jerry is about as uninspired a cartoon series as was ever created. It's pure generic cartoon thinking of the time. What is a cartoon? Uh... it's where a cat chases a mouse and there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">lots of hurt</a> and noise and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyCartoon">mayhem</a>. It's hard to be more basic than that, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Bill and Joe</a> didn't fix something that wasn't broken for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">15 or 16 years</a>. For that whole period <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast">they didn't even try to create new characters</a>."
</div><ul><li> In fairness there were variations, especially in the later shorts. Sometimes a third member would come into the fray, which either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">became a common foe the two teamed up against</a>, or one of them tried to play against the other. In some cartoons they are even allies who try to avoid a mutual dilemma (eg. playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter">Badly Battered Babysitter</a> to a runaway infant).
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> episodes start with some sort of conflict between two or more campers, a challenge which plays off that conflict (which takes up most of the episode), and an elimination ceremony that will resolve it unless the conflict is over several episodes (except for when they didn't do an elimination). It makes it extremely difficult to vary the amount of screentime, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> for multiple characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em>: Meet villain of the episode, girls having some problem in their personal lives, Jerry whoops them away and explains the situation, go on mission, run into villain, one or all girls get captured or discovered, one or all of them gets mutated / brainwashed etc, break free, confront villains, beat them, change back to normal. End episode. Sometime the plots factor into the daily life problems, sometimes not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a></em>: Not all of them, but mostly it's: Wallace and Gromit opens new business. Business don't go so well. Wallace invents crazy new device to help business. Gromit makes a face. New invention goes awry/falls into the wrong hands/etc. Big action chase scene at the end. Gromit makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideGlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsideGlance">Aside Glance</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WildAnimalBabyExplorers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WildAnimalBabyExplorers">Wild Animal Baby Explorers</a></em>, the Explorers are outside doing something when one of them wonders something related to animals. They decide to go exploring and sing the song "<em>Let's explore, more and more / There's so much to do and see! (Wild Animal Baby!) / Let's explore, there's fun galore / In making new discoveries.</em>" They begin exploring and at some point meet up with Miss Sally, their mentor, who has useful info for them. Sometime during the exploration, Sammy the skunk hides and they have to find him. Eventually, the exploration comes to an end and they say "Out and about, over and out!" They then talk about what their favorite thing they saw was on the exploration and then one of them prompts the others to imitate something they saw one of the animals they explored doing. As they do this, recap footage begins playing of animals explored in the episode as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingThemeTune">Bragging Theme Tune</a> of sorts plays, talking about their exploration and how they're "the greatest bunch in history." After a brief coda, the episode ends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wunschpunsch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wunschpunsch">Wunschpunsch</a></em> manages to take this trope to Scooby-Doo-like levels. Each episode follows this pattern: We see the villains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">shower attention upon their pets</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">going about their daily business</a> (Bubonic commonly cooks, Tyrannia works on her appearance). Maledictus T. Maggot shows up and berates them for not having cast any evil spells lately and forces them to cooperate. The villains berate each other for their lack of achievement before coming up with an idea for a spell. They use their combined power to cast the spell. Their pets witness the resulting devastation and plot to stop it before it becomes permanent. They fail to find a solution and seek out the aid of a wise turtle who gives them a cryptic riddle. Meanwhile, the villains take jabs at each other as they revel in their wickedness. The animals figure out the riddle and reverse the spell at the last minute. Maggot shows up and gives the villains their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>. The animals rejoice.
