Unfortunately, sometimes they have the opposite effect.
</p><p>Maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> accidentally wronged some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBystander">Innocent Bystander</a> — say, they or their loved ones were casualties in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroInsurance">collateral damage from a super-battle</a> — and said bystander decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">turn evil to settle the grudge</a>. Alternatively, the character may already be evil, but the Hero's intervention results in the villain gaining superpowers, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">a super-grudge</a> to boot.
</p><p>In a parody or deconstruction of this trope, it might go on to reveal that the actions of the hero were actually irrelevant in terms of the individual's true nature. They were ultimately a disturbed individual who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">looking for the first excuse they could find to justify their evil behavior</a>.
</p><p>Naturally, this is common in comic books. In many cases, however, the villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">origin story</a> isn't even hinted at in their first appearance—it's only after the villain becomes popular that they're given a personal tie to the Hero via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retroactive Continuity</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> A very interesting variant is presented in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a>. It's the unique and slightly dark manga that the main characters wrote that sets the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> in the series, Toru Nanamine, on the path to becoming a conniving douche-canoe when he becomes old enough to publish his own manga. For instance, the short that they publish, <em>Money and Intelligence</em>, which takes place in a world where people are ranked based on how smart they are and how much money they have, convinces him to borrow lots of money from his father so he can essentially buy his way to popularity at school, and rely on the advice of people from the internet to revise his manga and give him ideas. Oh, and that last part has the added bonus of completely screwing over his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> editor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Ryoga</a> <em>tries</em> to call this on Ranma.

</li><li> One could argue that Shampoo is a villainess that Ranma created. Yeah, she would probably be just the same if she had never left her village, but Ranma was the one who humiliated her by eating her prize and then effortlessly beating her in battle, so it's his fault she's in Nerima making a nuisance of herself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie">Digimon: The Movie</a></em> (the dub compilation of the first three OVAs) it's suggested that Willis is the one who created Diaboromon (and the virus that infected him was passed on to Kokomon.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion">Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie: Rebellion</a></em>, Kyubey's attempts to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">restore the old Witch system directly causes Homura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>.

<ul><li> Additionally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that's also Madoka's fault. Halfway through the movie an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacGod">Amnesiac God</a> Madoka tells Homura that she would never want to sacrifice herself the way she did in the anime. This causes Homura to believe that Madoka isn't happy in her current position as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfGood">God of Good</a>, which drives Homura into creating a world where Madoka can be happy...even if it means becoming an existence that opposes Madoka</span>.
</li><li> On a less personal scale, <em>all</em> magical girls will eventually fall to despair <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and become witches, the very monsters they once fight</span>. This is why Homura opposes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype">Mami</a>: even though Mami's <em>intentions</em> are good, she is unknowingly responsible for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the creation of witches Oktavia and Gretchen</span>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>'s foes:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>. Many details of Joker's origin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">vary wildly</a>, but it's widely accepted that the Bat was somehow responsible for the Joker's fall into the vat of chemicals that turned him into the psychopathic clown.
</li><li> It's often suggested that while Batman isn't directly involved their origin, the tendency of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> to have garish costumes and gimmicks are a reaction to Batman's own. Batman's greatest triumph was to break the mob's hold on Gotham, and his greatest failure was attracting a bunch of psychopathic weirdos to take their place.
</li><li> This was subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "The Trial" mentioned below. He was put on trial by the Arkham inmates, with the Joker as judge, for the 'crime' of creating them all. In the end, the jury, made entirely of Batman's enemies, couldn't find him guilty of that... they admitted that the trappings or gimmicks might have been different without him, but they were what they were before he even showed up.
</li><li> One really dark storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCentral">Gotham Central</a></em> featured a reporter who killed a bunch of teenage boys and dressed up their bodies to look like Robin solely because he wanted to become a Batman villain.
</li><li> Clayface V is an example, although the creation was a result of Jean-Paul Valley's actions as Batman, rather than Bruce Wayne's. Valley defeated both of Cassius Clay Payne's parents (Clayface III and Lady Clayface), causing him to become a ward of the State. He knew that putting an already special-needs metahuman child in such a situation would almost certainly create a supervillain...he just didn't care.
</li><li> An incredibly rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusEvil">Evil vs. Evil</a> example of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy">Poison Ivy</a> creating the monstrous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPerson">Plant Person</a> Harvest; originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManEatingPlant">Man-Eating Plant</a> she engineered for her own amusement, after a year of feeding it with any human she felt like (citing victims as including "tiresome lovers, incompetent henchmen and people who returned [my] smile"), the sheer number of human brains dissolving in its system affected it; the plant mutated into a monster possessed by the fragmented psyches/souls of all its former meals, driving it to hunt and attempt to kill its own creator.
</li><li> Ironically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero">inverted</a> with Batman himself: it was the mob and the Court of Owls' rule over Gotham, and the death of the Waynes in particular, that drove Bruce Wayne to become Batman.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em>, a psychiatrist argues that Batman has this effect on Gotham as a whole, due to his sheer charisma and force of presence causing others to mold themselves to fit, essentially claiming that Batman has a mental illness that spreads via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>. What's even more interesting, is that the comic at least implies that this is actually the case, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Joker coming out of a decade-long catatonia in response to Batman's return</span>.

<ul><li> Pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> was a fan of Superman, then went on to hate his guts after an accident made Luthor lose his precious... hair, as well as a protoplasmic lifeform he had created, and his laboratory. Luthor believed that it was done out of jealousy for Luthor's genius and vowed to prove he was better than Supes. While this seems like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>, that same story had Luthor create multiple grandiose engineering projects for Smallville to show Superboy up, only to have all of them go disastrously wrong and force Clark to intervene. Thus Luthor's hate grew due to his warped perception that Superboy was out to publicly humiliate him despite the fact that Superboy had no choice in the matter. Later, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the Silver Age</a>, Luthor gained a more legitimate reason: He blamed Supes for the death of his wife. Nowadays he's often still technically self-created, but it's not exactly Superman's fault: he turned to villainy over jealousy of Superman's achievements.
</li><li> The jealousy factors into his Silver Age origin as well. The experiment Superboy interrupted was one of a series of increasingly over the top acts of science Luthor was engaging in to win respect and admiration that kept getting overshadowed by the Boy of Steel.
</li><li> The villain Gog gets his start when Superman shatters his illusions about Superman being some messiah, thus causing Gog to see him as the Antichrist.
</li><li> Bizarro, naturally, since he's an imperfect copy of Superman. Parasite would arguably be less dangerous without Superman to drain for power, and Metallo would at least be much more limited in his activities since Kryptonite is by far the best power source for his robot body.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a>, Metallo is created by Professor Vale, who believes Superman is an alien invader, and creates Metallo to defend humanity. In the comics continuity post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a>, John Corben decides to become Metallo after seeing Superman easily fight his way out of a high security military base.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Vale</strong>: Are you sure you want to go through with this, John? <br/><strong>John Corben</strong>: You saw what happened earlier. We need Steel Soldier more than ever, Professor Vale. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheSuperman">Someone has to stop Superman</a>... We're going to do what we have to.
</div></li><li> Supes also brought the Eradicator to Earth (it was a supercomputer from Krypton, he just didn't realize its purpose would be malevolent.) He threw the Eradicator into the sun, causing the Eradicator to come back as an energy being, then the energy being created a new body for itself based on Superman.
</li><li> Cyborg Superman. Superman believed that energy being Hank Henshaw could not master Kryptonian technology, so he trapped Henshaw in his birthing matrix. Result: Henshaw used the technology and traces of Superman's DNA to return as a kryptonian cyborg with a grudge.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a> incarnation of Kryptonite Man, Clay Ramsay, was an ordinary man who joined a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> program after Superman tossed him out of his apartment for beating his wife.
</li><li> The New 52 version of Magog was a young boy whose family and friends were killed during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>'s invasion of Earth. He blames Superman and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> for failing to save them, and becomes a supervillain to take his revenge.

Brock's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> came from finally admitting it was his own fault and not Peter's.
</li><li> The Venom symbiote itself is often portrayed as having been consumed with resentment (and abandonment issues) after Peter rejected it, going on to influence several hosts into lives of villainy and Spider-Man harassment.
</li><li> Roderick Kingsley, alias, the original Hobgoblin is an indirect example: he got his start when he was tipped to the location of the Green Goblin's old gear when a minor criminal that Spider-Man allowed to get away stumbled across the stuff. Before that, the Hobgoblin was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> who Spider-Man saved from a supervillain that was trying to get revenge on Kingsley. Kingsley was determined not to be so vulnerable again, which made him look for ways to increase his power and meet the criminal who found the Green Goblin's equipment.
</li><li> Green Goblin II/Harry Osborn also counts, as he became a villain to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvengingTheVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvengingTheVillain">avenge his dad</a> (although one could easily argue that it was his father's actions that truly created the second Green Goblin).

Vulture exists because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> endangered his business, not because of anything Peter did, but this still fits with Tony's habit of accidentally creating villains (see below).

Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Doom blamed Richards</a>. However, Doom is actually a subversion of this trope. Reed's actions actually didn't make him a villain, Doom just blames him for his own mistakes. In fact, Reed could have probably prevented Doom from becoming a villain if Reed's warnings hadn't been ignored. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's later revealed, however, that due to Doom's poor treatment of Reed, Ben Grimm sabotaged his machine on purpose to teach him a lesson.</span>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1">Iron Man</a></em>, Obadiah Stane is an evil genius in his own right, but it takes technology stolen from Tony Stark to complete his Iron Monger armor. That said, it is Tony's careless neglect in running the business his father left him which allows many of his weapons to end up all over the world, directly contributing to considerable harm and indirectly leading to the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a> in the <em>Avengers</em> films.

His real grudge is against Tony's dead father - if Tony had never been born - or had died before the end of the first movie - Vanko may not have engaged in any criminal activity whatsoever. If Vanko didn't know Stark was Iron Man, his revenge probably wouldn't have involved building a suit of armor. Then Vanko improves his energy whips using suggestions from Tony himself. And, Justin Hammer would presumably be a conniving weasel with or without Tony's influence, but if weren't for Stark/Iron Man, he wouldn't have been trying to build suits of armor, or broken Vanko out of jail, or had access to the War Machine armor.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDescendants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDescendants">The Descendants</a></em>, the titular heroes inadvertently did this (at least in the eyes of Gundown and Slicer) when a random drug dealer they caught made bail and carjacked Slicer, dragging her behind the car he stole for three blocks. She (and her brother) felt it was their fault for not just killing the dealer.
<ul><li> More recently, the Joykiller has decided that his goal is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="urllink" href="http://www.descendantsserial.paradoxomni.net/the-descendants-96-kill-hope-chp-1/">kill Hope<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> because he feels she does too much good with her healing. Ironically, she feels the exact opposite</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em>, the Jedi Order inevitably ends up creating the Sith Order. Each time the Sith are wiped out, some Dark Jedi, recently separated from the Order, finds Holocrons left by a previous Sith Lord and the Order is born anew. The worst part is that this cycle has occurred over <em>half a dozen times</em>.
<ul><li> Ajunta Pall creates what is presumably the original Sith order after being kicked out of the Jedi Order.
</li><li> Freedon Nadd, having left the Jedi order due to massive ego and rampant paranoia, finds the holocron of one of the old Sith Lords, and resurrects the order.
</li><li> Ditto for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TalesOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TalesOfTheJedi">Exar Kun</a>, who finds other Sith Holocrons and resurrects the Sith order.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Revan</a> breaks off from the Jedi to form a new Sith Order - in order to fight the remains of what he calls "the true Sith".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Revan's former Jedi Master, Kreia</a>, leaves the Jedi to find out why her apprentice turned. She makes her own mini Sith order. Ironically, her goal was to destroy the Force itself, as she saw that as long as the Jedi existed, there would be a Sith order, and that their conflicts would inevitably doom the galaxy. So she sought to eliminate both.
</li><li> Darth Desolous ditches the Jedi because he thinks the Sith are cooler. Cue mini Sith order on his homeworld.
</li><li> Darth Ruin leaves the Jedi, starting the order <em>again</em> and begins the New Sith Wars.
</li><li> At the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthBane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthBane">battle of Ruusan</a>, the Jedi were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">shoving lightsabers into the hands of small children</a> and sending them to slaughter. They also deemed the native "Bouncers" as too dangerous to keep alive because of the thought bomb. Well, one of those Force Sensitive kids sees her Bouncer friend killed by Jedi right before her horrified eyes. Congratulations! They just created Darth Zannah! Thus, the sole survivor of the Sith Order has the apprentice he needs to rebuild from scratch.
</li><li> And then, with Luke Skywalker having destroyed both master and apprentice of the Sith, you'd think it's over, right? Well... No. There's a Jedi Purge survivor that starts a Sith order that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Legacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Legacy">rise to power 100 years later</a>. And Jedi from Skywalker's new Jedi Order jumping ship (one in particular who is even related to him!). Luke has angst about this trope, wondering if he's not training Jedi the right way, but he does try hard; most villains he trained went bad entirely on their own, after they left him. However, there <em>was</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNewRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNewRebellion">Brakiss</a>, who was an Imperial spy who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Becoming the Mask</a> and really starting to trust Luke. Luke trusted him too and thought he'd completely make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, and put him through a test of his spirit just like he'd do to any of his other students... and it was too much for Brakiss to take.
</li><li> And then there's this little stroke of brilliance from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediApprentice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediApprentice">Jedi Apprentice</a></em>, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon's backstory series. So, the Jedi council has this problem kid, Xanatos. Too much anger and whatnot. His Master believes in him, but the Council doesn't. And they decide that hey, they're not sure they can trust him, they need to put him to the test. So they send him and his Master to intervene in a conflict where his <em>dad</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">The Man Behind the Man</a>, and everyone knows it, in the hopes that he'll screw up and they can boot him out. Well as it turns out, the plan works <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">a little too well</a>. Xanatos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face Heel Turns</a>, his Master is forced to kill his father, and he swears bloody revenge on the Temple, going on to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> out for Jedi blood, who spreads slavery and death wherever he goes, and targets Qui-Gon (his ex-master) and Obi-Wan at every turn. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It Heroes</a>.
</li><li> If there's any conciliation to the Jedi's ability to create their own worst enemies, it's that the Sith are just as good at it. The person most likely to kill a Sith isn't a Jedi - it's their own apprentice. Just around the movie timeline, Darth Tenebrous killed his own master, and was in turn killed by his apprentice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthPlagueis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthPlagueis">Darth Plagueis</a>. Plagueis was eventually murdered in his sleep by his apprentice, Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine, who was tossed down a bottomless pit a few decades later by <em>his</em> apprentice, Darth Vader.
</li><li> Nor is Sith tendency to create their own nemeses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero">confined to villains</a>. Darth Vader's own son blows up the Death Star and eventually defeats his father, and his daughter plays a massive role in the Rebellion. Darth Vader's apprentice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">Starkiller</a>, is responsible for founding the Rebel Alliance. <em>Anakin Skywalker's</em> apprentice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Ahsoka Tano</a>, becomes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Fulcrum", a major organizer in the Rebel Alliance</span>.

His arrogance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery">Underestimating Badassery</a> of Peter Pettigrew also played a part <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the latter's betrayal and his eventual death</span>.

Her incest with Jaime (which was most likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">a form of narcissism on her part</a>) and terrible parenting of their son Joffrey (she didn't trust anyone who wasn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a>, including Maesters, for example) kick off the War of the Five Kings, and she eventually reinstated the Faith Militant for yet another paranoid, petty scheme, an absolutely <em>boneheaded</em> move <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which backfired on her spectacularly when they turn on her for the aforementioned incest and have her publicly humiliated</span>.

</li><li> Spike has created at least one villain: Dana, from the episode "Damage". This one is albeit only indirectly Spike's fault. Dana was kidnapped as a little girl by a human psychopath, implying sexual assault. Later in life, Dana's Slayer visions (allowing her to have psychic dreams and access to the memories of former Slayers) activate. Since Spike has chased around and killed two Slayers he's in a lot of the Slayer memories, leading Dana's damaged mind to substitute him for her actual childhood abuser. When it was all done he even hypocritically told her "I've done a lot of horrible things, just not to you" - though at the end of the episode, he remarks to Angel that it doesn't matter that he wasn't her childhood abuser, he did just as bad or worse to plenty of others.

</li><li> And though they didn't <em>create</em> the Wraith and the Replicators, they <em>woke up</em> the Wraith, who'd been dormant, and turned the Replicators into a scourge against humanity.

This failed. The Asurans then took Atlantis after it had been reclaimed by a crew of Ancients, then tried to strike at Earth, <em>then</em> tried to destroy Atlantis again. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood">Brainwashing for the Greater Good</a> was pretty much the only option open to the Atlantis team - though they probably should have guessed that the Asurans would take to wiping out human worlds to stop the Wraith.

Kevin Steen became bitter over being barred from returning to Ring Of Honor by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a>, but that barring was Steen's own doing when he tried to comeback through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TruthMartini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TruthMartini">Truth Martini</a>. Steen was barred in the first place after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserLeavesTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserLeavesTown">Loser Leaves Town</a> match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElGenerico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ElGenerico">El Generico</a>, which resulted from a feud Steen provoked.

When Cornette and Generico were out of the picture, Steen's rage at ROH and the wrestling industry faded but by then Jacobs and Corino were too far gone. They ousted Steen from the group to continue on the path of destruction with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Matt Hardy</a> in his place. S.C.U.M. had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rhyno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rhyno">Rhino</a> injure Jay Briscoe, who had defeated Steen for the World Championship belt while he was coming back to his senses, convincing Steen he had to end what he had started.
</li><li> While The Lovely Lacey and Radiant Rain were always fairly vain, they likely never would have become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">alpha bitches</a> known as The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew if it wasn't for them being ruthlessly bullied by The Experience, Lexie Fyfe and Malia Hosaka. That said, The Experience remained villains themselves, so this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestServedCold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestServedCold">didn't come into play</a> until Fyfe founded her own promotion, SHINE Wrestling, and Radiant Rain formed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">Power Stable</a>, Valkyrie, to undermine it.
</li><li> The World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico and Dominican Wrestling Entertainment were among the initial members of the World Wrestling League when it started in 2012 and thus directly responsible for the creation of their chief rival when they decided to breakaway from it. In the beginning there was no competition because the League was very similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">National Wrestling Alliance</a>, focusing more on collaborating events to give fans matches they would not otherwise be able to see as well as introducing wrestlers and styles to new markets. But two years into this arrangement, WWL started acting like a promotion in its own right, testing the local waters of Bayamon with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">aptly titled</a> "Insurrection" event, which put the spot light on very few wrestlers contracted by member promotions in favor of the talent from WWC's old rival, IWA Puerto Rico, that had remained free agents after its closure. WWC started to show particular resentment for WWL's more exclusive local shows in 2015 when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio">El Patron Alberto</a> took a booking for <em>Guerrera de Reyes</em> in January and became the WWL Heavyweight Champion after WWC had been trying and failing to get him booked for their Aniversario tour the prior year. WWL responded to the two leaving it by running even fewer collaborative shows in favor of more designed to directly compete with the local companies more often. The WWC rivalry is by far the most pronounced of the two, as WWC was taking potshots at WWL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">even when it was a member</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">take thats</a> between the two only escalated after business was off but WWL's promotion of their Dominican television deal in October of that same year suggested it was not just WWC they had in their sights.
</li><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">Bullet Club</a> were <em>supposed</em> to be villains, they became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">faces</a> by default in Ring of Honor for two reasons. One was being credited for the returns of popular wrestlers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks">The Young Bucks</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>. Two was opposing local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">Power Stable</a> The Kingdom. So it should have been Bullet Club's members as much as anyone who should have known associating with Kingdom's most recent centerpiece <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdamCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdamCole">Adam Cole</a> was a bad idea. Styles and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KarlAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KarlAnderson">Karl Anderson</a> <em>did</em> know, but after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega">Kenny Omega</a>'s hostile takeover, he let Cole right in. The only surprising things were how long it took Cole to turn on Omega, that Cole was willing to throw the Young Bucks under the bus if it meant undermining Omega and that when Cole ultimately failed Bullet Club replaced him with an even more obvious villain known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MartyScurll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MartyScurll">Marty Scurll</a>. Actually there were two other surprises. Bullet Club's next two internal conflicts came from seemingly nicer new recruit <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody</a></em>, then Tongan members <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GuerrillasOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GuerrillasOfDestiny">Tama Tonga, Tanga Roa</a> and Bad Luck Fale, Tonga and Fale being originals sick of the post Omega/Cole disfunction. <em>Scurll</em> did prove relatively loyal, despite standing out as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a> on an already evil team. Cody was also loyal when left alone. Omega turned Cody on him by making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">sexual advances towards Cody's wife</a>!
</li><li> Alex Shelley started Search And Destroy to bring Ring of Honor back to its roots, centered around young wrestlers pushing each other to new heights in <em>honorable</em> contests. The group was to serve as an alternative to The Kingdom, CHAOS, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">Bullet Club</a>, etc to show the youth backstabbing, cheating, ambushes and the like were not necessary for success but the group he, Chris Sabin and first recruit Jay White defeated were The Cabinet. The Cabinet themselves were about taking ROH back to its roots, to "make wrestling great again", but they were fighting the increased family friendly nature and corporate structure of the company, as well as wrestlers perceived as unmanly. Shelley's mission statement after the victory reignited Kenny King, Rhett Titus and Caprice Coleman's resentment towards ROH's newer, younger wrestlers, with the possible exception of Shane Taylor, who they recruited to send all the others out of ROH with injuries as The Cabinet became The Rebellion. Among The Rebellion's victims were two more Search And Destroy recruits, 2015 and 2016 Top Prospects Donovan Dijak and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LioRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LioRush">Lio Rush</a>. Search And Destroy would force The Rebellion to disband a <em>Best In The World</em>, but the damage done to them could not be undone.

This invocation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryForTheDevil">Cry for the Devil</a> helps fuel the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a> of the setting.
<ul><li> Lorgar of the Word Bearers, the Arch-Priest of Chaos who was instrumental in turning the others to Chaos, only did so because the Emperor ordered the destruction of a civilization that Lorgar felt was his crowning achievement, and then publicly humiliated the devoted and loyal Legion in front of their Ultramarines, calling them the one Legion he was disappointed with and proclaiming every achievement of Lorgar's life was a failure. Making matters worse, he had said nothing about his disapproval of Lorgar's methods for over a century beforehand.
</li><li> Angron of the World Eaters was a mentally damaged berserker, whom the Emperor forcibly abducted from the ranks of his fellow rebel slaves — the only friends and family he had ever known — and forced to watch die from safety in orbit when Angron refused to voluntarily abandon them. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a></em> novels, Angron at one point comments he would have turned against the Emperor <em>sooner</em> if his mind had been stabler.
</li><li> Magnus of the Thousand Sons only turned to Tzeentch for salvation when his attempts to warn the Emperor of Horus' corruption and rebellion lead to the Emperor refusing to head Magnus, instead dubbing <em>him</em> the traitor, and sending the Space Wolves — who hate and despise the Thousand Sons to begin with — to destroy Magnus, his Legion and his whole world.
<ul><li> Actually, the Emperor only wanted to arrest Magnus to have him brought to Terra, however, on the way to Prospero, Horus gave Leman Russ new orders; the Emperor had changed his mind and wanted Prospero and the Thousand Sons destroyed. That said, sending the Legion that hated the Thousand Sons the most to apprehend them in the first place probably wasn't going to end very well either way, and was likely the very reason Horus gave the order: He knew Russ wouldn't question the order to kill Magnus if he thought it came from the Emperor.
</li><li> It's also implied that Magnus had been in Tzeentch's thrall well before the Emperor found him, and made a further pact with the Chaos God to save his Legion from a mutation curse that probably existed <em>because Magnus was in Tzeentch's thrall</em>. Magnus didn't realize how deep he'd gone until Tzeentch chose to collect during the Battle of Prospero.

Same goes for every other Dark Angel stationed there.
</li><li> Moving things away from the Imperium, there's the Eldar. The Eldar Empire's decadence combined with their race's naturally powerful psyker abilities made the Warp start to manifest a being that reflected their hedonism. The Eldar who realized this was happening reacted in different ways. Some of them decided to get as far away from the rest of the Empire as possible to avoid the backlash after their attempts to get the rest of the Empire to stop being irresponsible hedonistic idiots went nowhere. Others threw themselves even deeper into bloody hedonism since creating a new god of pleasure appealed to them. And that's how Slaanesh was born. The new Chaos God repaid the Eldar by slaughtering their pantheon, slaughtering most of their race, and eating their souls after death. The factions of the surviving Eldar are defined by the different ways they try to prevent Slaanesh from finishing the job.

Thousands of years ago in the series backstory, the ancestors to the Nords once nearly drove the Falmer to extinction, and in their desperation, the surviving Falmer fled to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Dwemer</a> cousins, who twisted and mutated them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMorlocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMorlocks">Morlock-like</a> monsters. The Falmer of the 4th era are now growing more bold, venturing above ground to kidnap surface dwellers while their numbers swell beneath ground. They also seem to be regaining some of their lost sentience, forging better weapons and armor from farmed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Chaurus</a> chitin and practicing crude alchemy to create poisons from the plentiful mushrooms that grow in their underground lairs. The writer of one in-game book even believes that the Falmer may be planning a war with their surface dwelling adversaries, which would be bad news for the already war-torn Skyrim of the era.
<ul><li> The Nords themselves are this to the Falmer. When Ysgramor first came to Skyrim from Atmora, he and his followers were content to mind their own business in a few small settlements they built, but the native Falmer absolutely hated the newcomers and tried to drive them off time and again. This all came to a breaking point when the Nords accidentally found the Eye of Magnus in Saarthal. They had no idea what it was and had no intention of using it (being that they naturally distrusted magic), but the paranoid Falmer believed it was just a matter of time before the Nords used it to annihilate them and launched a completely unprovoked preemptive attack on Saarthal, slaughtering everyone inside to the last man, woman and child... except Ysgramor, who escaped, returned to Atmora and came back with the Five Hundred Companions, and much less friendly intentions than he previously had. The ensuing asskicking made the Falmer scuttle to the Dwemer for protection... and since the Dwemer were dicks, they enslaved them in turn after tricking them. The same thing happened with the Ayleid, who were instantly hostile to the Cyro-Nords when they expanded to Cyrodiil and mass enslaved them without even trying to talk or negotiate... causing, years later, the rise and rebellion of the Slave Queen, Alessia, and their own near-extinction.

<ul><li> Mengsk himself was an example of this. His father, Angus, infamous across the sector for his stance against the rampant corruption, military oppression, and gentrification of the Confederacy, helped to foment a rebellion on his home planet of Korhal. The Confederacy responded first by sending Ghost agents to assassinate Angus and his family, then when the rebellion only swelled, they nuked the planet from orbit. Arcturus was offworld at the time, and when he received word, he vowed revenge on the Confederacy and formed the Sons of Korhal. He would eventually succeed, bringing about the fall of the Confederacy by luring the aforementioned Zerg invasion to Tarsonis, which was the Confederacy's seat of government. Oh, and the reason he abandoned Kerrigan to the Zerg is because Kerrigan was one of the Ghosts sent to kill his family. While he pretended to forgive her in order to make use of her, he got rid of her when her usefulness to him ran out.

<ul><li> A villain creating their own villain:
<ul><li> Roland Daggett's attempts to control Matt Hagen with his highly addictive facelift-in-a-jar concoction eventually turned the man into Clayface.
</li><li> It was Rupert Thorne's attempt to blackmail Harvey Dent that lead to Dent's transformation into Two-Face, the transformation itself lead to Two-Face's extra-legal war on Thorne's criminal organization.

For an added bonus, they also kidnap the District Attorney who initially <em>made</em> the claim that he creates these villains and forces her to act as his defense. After hearing them all speak, the DA comes to the conclusion that even <em>if</em> Batman had not pushed them off the edge, they were all deeply disturbed people and would have entered villainy anyway from their own motivations, just with less-silly costumes. In fact, <em>they</em> created <em>him</em>. The villains then come to terms with this and <em>find Batman innocent</em>... and then, because they <em>are</em> such bad guys, they try to kill him anyway.

When he goes insane and begins kidnapping the people he blames for the cities problems (The police, bureaucrats and reporters that he says <em>cause</em> the criminals) Robin snarkily comments "Another fine villain made possible by a grant from the Wayne Foundation." The look Batman shoots him is <em>not</em> happy.

As Powers had Terry's father killed - and so many others <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ButForMeItWasTuesday/WesternAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ButForMeItWasTuesday/WesternAnimation">he can barely remember them</a> - Terry feels no sympathy or regret for the man.

While at first he "only" intended to murder Bruce, and that only to secure more funding for his research, once Batman causes him to go deaf during their battle he went insane and became a full-fledge supervillain with the sole goal of getting revenge on Batman. Shriek did have initial problems, since he was trying to commit murder for monetary gain.
</li><li> Powers actually did the inverse and <em>recreated</em> Batman since his attempts to cover up his abuses brought Terry and Bruce together.
</li></ul></li><li> Project Cadmus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> is an unusual case, in that they both play this trope straight <em>and</em> have it applied to them.

<ul><li> In "The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker", it is revealed that Timmy himself is responsible for the cause of Mr. Crocker's obsession with fairies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">when he traveled back to the 70s to stop it from happening</a>. Back then, Crocker, like Timmy, used to be a happy child who has bullied by his own evil babysitter, Vic (the male counterpart of Vicky), and had fairy godparents (who ironically happened to be Cosmo and Wanda, though neither of them seem to remember this). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Timmy accidentally reveals the existence of Crocker's fairies</a> at a town meeting whilst trying to stop Crocker from doing so.

It gets even worse that Timmy accidentally left behind Mr. Crocker's own DNA Tracker which he was using to track him down in the past, thus returning it to the past Crocker.
</li><li> Parodied when Timmy becomes <em>The Masked Magician</em>. The Crimson Chin warns Timmy about creating his own supervillain, and lo and behold... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">The Hanker-Chief!</a>
</li><li> Crimson Chin is speaking from experience: His archenemy, the Bronze Kneecap ("and his big BRONZE KNEECAP!!!"), turns evil when, in a parody of supervillain origins, the Chin accidentally breaks his leg during a <em>jai alai</em> tournament, causing him to get third place once again, and then doesn't apologize. And so Ron Hambone melted down and his third-place bronze trophies...
</li><li> The third <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJimmyTimmyPowerHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJimmyTimmyPowerHour">crossover</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius">Jimmy Neutron</a></em> had Timmy and Jimmy purposely making a new villain after they discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoryIsBoring">how easily their combined skills trumped all their regular enemies</a>. What makes this funny is that they made a villain, though he wasn't quite as evil as they had hoped, so they ditch him, which then causes the trope to be played oh so wonderfully straight. Confusing? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>.
</li><li> And in another episode when Timmy wished for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuper">world of superheroes</a>, he accidentally created super-<em>villains</em> as well.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, Cyrus "The Colossus" Rhodes hates the Autobots apparently because he lost his job to a machine, and Prometheus Black has a gripe against Sumdac because Sumdac Systems gets all the lucrative contracts instead of him. Interestingly, before Black became Meltdown, he was receiving funding from a member of Sumdac Systems' board of directors.
<ul><li> Blackarachnia in the same series <strike>might count</strike> definitely counts, as she allied herself with the Decepticons after Optimus and Sentinel abandoned her on Archa 7, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">spider planet</a>, believing she was dead.
<ul><li> Sentinel also came to hate Optimus after the <em>very same incident</em>, sparking an intensely antagonistic relationship between the two.
</li><li> To be fair to Optimus, it was <em>their</em> idea to go to Archa 7 in the first place; in fact, the only reason he was there with them was to keep them out of trouble. Circumstances just weren't in their favor, and Optimus (willingly) took the blame for the incident since he was the commanding officer.
</li></ul></li><li> Wasp was falsely implicated as being a Decepticon spy and during his time in the stockade went nuts and wants a lot of revenge on Bumblebee. Though, Wasp wasn't a very nice bot to begin with.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>:
<ul><li> Probably as a parody to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> example above, Vlad, Maddie and Jack are working on their first Ghost Portal. Jack pours diet soda into a crucial part, and it blows up in Vlad's face, giving him Ecto-Acne, and with it, his ghost powers. Then he goes all evil and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">revengey</a>.
</li><li> Technus, though in a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> and humorous way. Danny unintentionally frees him from the Ghost Portal (or something) when he first meets him. Assuming him to be a villain, Danny tells him he will not take over the world. Technus, confused, then enlightened actually takes his advice, thus setting his path of villainy.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied with Señor Senior Senior from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>: Ron "causes" him to become a supervillain, inasmuch as Ron's observation on how much he seems like one already (particularly in his private island mansion resembling a typical supervillain lair) inspires the man to take up villainy as a hobby. Really, though, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Ron hadn't said anything about the whole lair thing</a>, SSS would've likely remained nothing more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarilyLargeBankAccount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarilyLargeBankAccount">an eccentric multi-billionaire</a>.

Played for comic relief, as his revenge was merely a pie-shooting bazooka. For the record, the gargoyles inadvertently cost him every job he ever had since 1997. And the pie was banana creme. The gargoyle<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">s, including Goliath,</span> who took the pie, has no idea who he is. Or why he did it.
</li><li> David Xanatos created Thailog, a clone of Goliath educated with Xanatos' own worldview. Naturally, Thailog turned on <em>everybody</em>.
</li><li> The Hunters were created when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Demona</span> slashed the face of a farm boy.

</li><li> Gargoyles likes doing this. During the time travel episode when Xanatos travels back in time with his new wife Fox as a honeymoon trip and his father to make a pact with The Illuminati to guarantee his fortune in the present and future. Goliath tags along to keep Xanatos honest, while at the same time using the opportunity to find a younger version of Demona and try to convince her not to give into hatred for humans. Instead, Goliath's speech did the opposite and made Demona more cautious of humans, especially after encountering her future self as well. When they returned to the present, Demona made it clear that she remembered his message and it changed nothing.

<ul><li> The episode "The Ballad of Duke Baloney" shows a flashback where Scrooge went on a business trip to South Africa and came across a young shoe-shiner named Duke Baloney, who was just like him in that he had dreams of becoming rich starting with this gig. Scrooge offered Duke a dime with the intention of inspiring him into going down the same path, but Duke was instead angered that he was paid below the minimum wage by the richest duck in the world and dedicated his life to ruining Scrooge, taking on a new persona known as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flintheart Glomgold</span>.
</li><li> Similarly, Scrooge inadvertently played a role in the creation of a serious new villain: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DarkwingDuck">Negaduck</a></span>.

He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">continues to drive further into madness</a>, further determined to reclaim the spotlight, which cumulates in a battle between him and his replacement, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonCharacterAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonCharacterAllAlong">Drake Mallard</a></span>.
