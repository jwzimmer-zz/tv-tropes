<ul><li> Ayane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">Stealth Mentor</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AyanesHighKick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AyanesHighKick">Ayane's High Kick</a></em> is working a different job every time he's seen, because he's honestly kind of a loser.
</li><li> Tojo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a></em>. One possible explanation for his constant shuffling of part-time jobs is because he keeps getting into trouble when rival gang members show up to fight him.
</li><li> She never actually changes job titles, but the waitress from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> works at four or five different restaurants over the course of the series.
</li><li> One of the running jokes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBraveExpressMightGaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBraveExpressMightGaine">The Brave Express Might Gaine</a></em> is that Sally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, has a different job every single episode.
</li><li> Yunyun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Canaan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Canaan">Canaan</a></em> always seems to have exactly the job that will allow her to run into the main cast, which eventually allows her to join the cast in their antics. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted, though: she's not doing it just for the money or the thrill, but as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> for their enemies.</span>
<ul><li> Could also be a reference to the potential after effects of China's economic growth spurt, as Yunyun mentions that many in the slums take up several part-time jobs to make ends meet.
</li></ul></li><li> Touya in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, since in Japan, "Part-Time Job" (<em>arubaito</em>) is often more accurately described as "temp work" as opposed to a job where one works part time hours. The reason he has so many jobs is because he was only hired to work a particular one for a limited time. In a variation, though, he's the main character's brother and unknown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">Secret Keeper</a>, as opposed to just being a background joke character with no importance to the plot. Sakura herself comments that her brother holds a LOT of part time jobs, because Touya wants to make and save as much money possible, so he could go to college without being a burden for his father. He also is implied to take them so he can look after Sakura.
<ul><li> He even works in jobs across series — showing up in cameo jobs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kobato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kobato">Kobato.</a></em> as well as <em>across universes</em>, showing up several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em> at various jobs.
</li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kobato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kobato">Kobato.</a></em>, Fujimoto is another main character who keeps changing jobs — however, he does this to earn as much money as he can to support Sayaka.
</li></ul></li><li> Tamami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChocottoSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChocottoSister">Chocotto Sister</a></em> takes on more jobs than she can handle and then tries to let Haruma take the less attractive ones.
</li><li> Li Shenshun from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> always happens to be working at whatever place is most plot-relevant at the moment — of course, Li <em>is</em> the civilian alias of the "Black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Shinigami</a>" Hei
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Psiren, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief">Phantom Thief</a></span>, keeps changing jobs to avoid being caught by the police. The brothers Elric first meet her when she's working in a hospital, then changes to school nurse, nun, etc. This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Edward when they meet her in her nun get-up: "Why the hell do you keep changing jobs?!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Patrick, Jonathan, and Gasteau</a>, who had a different job each time they appeared in an episode, from imperial officers to doctors (though they were more often than not villains). They tended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">Faceless Goons</a> in later seasons.
</li><li> Hasegawa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> is either in a brand new job or without one. The explanation is because he is a MADAO. Also because he keeps asking Gintoki and Co. to help him with his jobs.
</li><li> One of the many reasons <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> is skilled and knowledgeable in everything before his current employment, he had to work as a child for his dead-beat parents with a lot of different jobs. He's just got one <em>now</em>, but we hear about his past now and then.
<ul><li> Also, Santa Claus (or someone that resembles him) has been shown to work at various jobs.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em>, Ai Enma's minions are often shown with different jobs as they observe a prospective client before the string is pulled, except in season three where they all keep the same jobs in a school since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're hanging out with the girl who's supposed to be replacing their current boss.</span>
</li><li> Throughout the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">the Landlady</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch">Hidamari Sketch</a></em> has been shown having a variety of jobs: delivering pizza coupon fliers and temping at the Berry-Mart, along with other, unspecified part-time jobs. She does this so she can keep tenants' rents lower, which is definitely a help to students like Miyako (who has lower rent than the others for other reasons, in addition).
</li><li> While Miki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ICantUnderstandWhatMyHusbandIsSaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ICantUnderstandWhatMyHusbandIsSaying">I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying</a></em> is most consistently seen as a detective, he has shown up in other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoolKyouShinsha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CoolKyouShinsha">Cool-Kyou Shinsha</a> works as the owner of a Maid Cafe (in <em>Metsuko ni Yoroshiku</em>) and crepe stand (in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em>).
</li><li> The cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKurosagiCorpseDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKurosagiCorpseDeliveryService">The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service</a></em> falls into this trope fairly often. Since the filling-the-last-wishes-of-the-dead business tends to be sporadic, they often fill it in with an astonishing array of contract or part-time jobs — from moving tombstones to faking alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CropCircles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CropCircles">Crop Circles</a>. It's usually the perpetually underemployed trio of Yata, Numata and Karatsu who are seen doing the heavy lifting, but Keiko often turns up in a number of unlikely consulting jobs due to her extremely-rare-in-Japan expertise in embalming. Sasaki seems to be the only one who holds a steady job. Of course, that steady job is selling celebrity gore photographs to fetishists, but hey, it's a living.
</li><li> One middle-aged woman can be found in almost every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, working in a different field every time. Whether it's actually meant to be the same woman isn't exactly clear, though... Especially since one of the later episodes has six or seven of them on screen at the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoraba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoraba">Mahoraba</a></em> has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeChineseGirl">Anime Chinese Girl</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">ends all of her sentences with ~yo</a> who's just not competent enough to keep a job for long.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, Hilde Schbeiker becomes a MS pilot for OZ, a junk dealer with Duo, a spy and a hacker. In the <em>Frozen Teardrop</em> novel, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she becomes a nurse, a librarian, an expert in nano technology and a nun.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MutekiKanbanMusume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MutekiKanbanMusume">Muteki Kanban Musume</a></em>: Justified with Kankuro, who has come back to Hanami only to beat Miki, (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">a task he sincerely believes would not take much time</a>) so he is doing part time jobs to support himself while he beats her: he has been seen working painting fences, cooking food at a festival, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">and working in some place with a skirt</a>.

</li><li> Rincewind also has a string of job titles, except while Ponder has all the jobs that need someone to actually do them, Rincewind has the jobs that <em>don't</em> need done, just as long as someone officially has the job title. He gets extra buckets of coal for his troubles and sometimes some extra food.

She eventually discovers that inhabitants are constantly rotated between absolutely different positions on a completely random basis: it serves the Sith purpose in a pretty twisted way.
</li><li> The father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwissFamilyRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwissFamilyRobinson">The Swiss Family Robinson</a></em> spent "a large portion of his childhood" in the workshops of pretty much every craftsman known to man. Admittedly he doesn't say he was working with them, but he had enough exposure to each to recreate their machinery <em>from memory</em>. In older, unedited-to-death editions, it becomes even clearer why he knows so much; he was a <em>pastor</em> back in Switzerland, and visited his congregation in their homes, including helping them out with their work while he talked with them.

This is a pretty justified case since most of the higher-ranking members of the Lannister forces continually prove themselves to be incompetent screwups, but Ser Addam handles every task that Lord Tywin gives him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperCompetentSidekick">with competence</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">the sort of charisma that inspires loyalty</a>. Over time Tywin develops a habit of assigning Ser Addam to fix whatever problem is bedeviling the Lannisters, keeping him there just long enough to iron things out, and then moving him on to the next problem. Ser Addam becomes exasperated by this, and in particular he loathes the last such assignment he is given, to be the captain of the capital's City Watch. When given a chance he leaps at the chance to get out of the job and go back to his original position as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryOfficer">a commander of the Lannister cavalary</a>.

Hurley bought Mr Clucks after winning the lottery (keeping Randy on as manager) but it was short-lived because the restaurant was hit by a meteorite.

</li><li> <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em>.
<ul><li> Out of sheer need and a desire to be useful (so the nice people don't kick him off) Neelix has been a jack of all trades. Morale officer, cook, diplomat, babysitter and much more as the plot calls for it. His background had given him a deep understanding of these jobs.
</li><li> Tom Paris is the Officer In Charge Of Everything. He's an ace pilot, engineer, negotiator, and transporter chief, and his training in biochemistry has made him the official nurse as well. Because obviously in a situation where you need a nurse there is no possible way you could also require a pilot. He's also their historian, at least when it comes to the 20th/21st century.

But during the course of the series he ends up as second-in-command to Galactica itself, caretaker to a community of refugees, and even CAG — commander of <em>all</em> Galactica's fighters and Raptors, despite no evidence of him being able to fly anything himself. "Copilot" implies actually having piloting skills, since the primary function of a copilot is to act as a backup pilot when necessary. We see Helo piloting a Raptor during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the assault upon the Resurrection Hub</span>. Much like the real-world US Navy aircraft carrier commanding officers, it seems that Colonial officers aren't eligible for command unless they have some amount of stick time in a cockpit.

Since then, he's had a number of jobs, including military advisor, Raptor pilot, military police, battlestar commander, lawyer, Quorum representative, and even president of the Colonies on various occasions. Sometimes he's held several of these positions at the same time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in one episode during some argument with Tom Zarek saying, "Excuse me, I'm confused, but what exactly is your job this week?"

A last-season episode revealed that he has technically been on strike from his bagel store job for the entire run of the show, and he managed to get himself fired immediately after going back.
</li><li> The 60s-70s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritCom">Brit Com</a> <em>The Worker</em> may count as a variation. The title character, played by Charlie Drake, can never hold down a job for more than one episode, but his reason for getting fired is never the same twice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, Amy Pond seems to have a different job in each episode it comes up. In order, she is presented as: A kissogram, a model, a journalist and, finally, a children's author. She also at one point has her own brand of perfume. While she may simply embark on each of these endeavors as they come, no mention is made of how she came to be in these roles. A less extreme example than many on this page, since from her perspective the episodes where she has these jobs are years apart, and besides the one jump from "pretty face" jobs to writing they share some of continuity.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingDoesntPay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingDoesntPay">If wrestling bothered to pay, maybe they wouldn't need to switch jobs so much.</a>
</li><li> Wrestlers often go through many personae in their career. Newer wrestlers may be given gimmicks designed to cover up their relative lack of experience, and older wrestlers may be given them to cover up declining skills. Sometimes, it's to give a wrestler a change of pace when one characterization has become stale.
<ul><li> In the mid 90's, a common trope was the Wrestling Professional. One of the classic examples is Thurmond "Sparky" Plugg, later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobHolly">Bob "Spark Plug" Holly</a>, who was a wrestling race car driver. Also around at the time, T.L. Hopper, the wrestling plumber, Duke "The Dumpster" Droese, the wrestling garbage man, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossman">Big Bossman</a>, the wrestling prison guard. Most of these gimmicks can safely be called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleCrap">WrestleCrap<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>, after debuting was directionless until management saw him jokingly rapping back stage. His first identifiable gimmick in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> was as a white rapper in the vein of Vanilla Ice, even releasing an album. While his freestyle raps were later abandoned, vestiges of it remained in his ring persona.
</li><li> These job changes can be dramatic. In the early 2000's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> took a turn from an undead, supernatural zombie character to a brutal biker, still called The Undertaker. He later returned to the "Deadman" gimmick due to negative reaction to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">"Bikertaker"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The undisputed king of changing jobs in professional wrestling is Ed Leslie, most well known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrutusBeefcake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrutusBeefcake">Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake</a> in WWF in the late 1980's. As a close friend of icon Hulk Hogan, he was always given preferential treatment, despite a relative lack of skill. To keep him at the front of people's minds, his character changed frequently. Some of his other gimmicks included "Brother Bruti", a fanatical follower of Hogan, and "The Bootyman", a Lothario. He in total has kept about 10-12 different on-screen characters, far more then most wrestlers do in a career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TeddyLong">Teddy Long</a> is best known as a referee, or maybe as a manager, or a general manager, or a political activist...
</li><li> This became part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a>'s persona, late in his career: At various times, he had been the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Cactus Jack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurferDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurferDude">Surfer Dude</a> Dude Love, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> Mankind. Foley played them off less as jobs than as alternate personalities, culminating in a memorable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> where Foley competed as <em>all three</em> of his personae (he got eliminated as Cactus Jack, went backstage and came out as Mankind, and later returned as Dude Love).
<ul><li> That wasn't the culmination... <em>seven years later</em>, WWE had fans vote online for several match stipulations at Taboo Tuesday. For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarlitoColon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarlitoColon">Carlito</a>'s match with Foley, the vote was whether Carlito would face Cactus Jack, Dude Love, or Mankind. Mankind won the vote and the match.

</li><li> The very point of the character Gil is to be perpetually dangling by a thread at his current job, whatever it may be — he was introduced as in real estate, another had him working at a shoe store, another was at a car lot, and another had him as a department store Santa.
</li><li> Although Lionel Hutz spent most of his appearance as an incompetent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a>, he's suddenly a babysitter in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E6MargeOnTheLam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E6MargeOnTheLam">"Marge on the Lam"</a>, tries to muscle his ways into being Milhouse's acting agent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E2RadioactiveMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E2RadioactiveMan">"Radioactive Man"</a> (also mentioning himself as an unauthorized biographer and drug "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondWordSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondWordSwap">keeper-away-er</a>), and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadyRealEstateAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadyRealEstateAgent">Shady Real Estate Agent</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E9RealtyBites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS9E9RealtyBites">"Realty Bites"</a>. One gets the impression the writers wanted to expand his role to other disreputable jobs, but the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilHartman">Phil Hartman</a> pushed Hutz into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorExistenceLimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorExistenceLimbo">Actor Existence Limbo</a>.
</li><li> Captain McCallister has held a lot of nautical jobs (despite not being a licensed captain), as well as owning and operating an all-you-can-eat seafood restaurant (the latter of which has been used more often in later episodes).
</li><li> Squeaky Voiced Teen (whose name was established as Mitch Peterson early on, then seemingly forgotten by the writers, and later established again as Jeremy Freedman) either works at Krusty Burger or works as a ticket taker, concession stand clerk, or usher at the Aztec Movie Theater (or the Googleplex). Some episodes have him working at an ice cream parlor called Phineas Q. Butterfat's.
</li><li> A mustached Charles Bronson-sound-alike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">known to fans as</a> "Sarcastic Middle-Aged Man" (also known as Wiseguy) is a customer service worker. Sideshow Bob calls him "Raphael" in one episode, but that name has never been used since. The following exchange occurred in "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation" with Homer in Sarcastic Man's taxi:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sarcastic Man:</strong> So, what do you do for a living? <br/><strong>Homer:</strong> Oh, you know, I'm a guy at a place. How'd you get such a crappy job? You a convict or a junkie? <br/><strong>Sarcastic Man:</strong> Little of both.
</div></li><li> "Bart Sells His Soul" features two mustached "Sarcastic Middle-Aged Men". One working as a bug exterminator at Milhouse's place, the other driving a street cleaner car, running over Bart's car, then driving it down a subway station staircase.
</li><li> That Jerk Who Says "<em>Yeeehs?</em>" is an homage to Frank Nelson, above.

<ul><li> Sal the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">heavily's-accented</a> New New Yorker. At least once, Sal has two different jobs in the same episode and is acknowledged to be the same guy. At the beginning of the episode, he's a truck driver. Later on, he's a construction worker, but he and Fry recognize each other from the truck stop. Considering it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFuture">The Future</a>, the creators haven't made up their minds whether there's one Sal who can't hold down a job or a cartload of identical clones. Why, precisely, one would clone a slovenly, ill-mannered customer like Sal is a riddle for the ages.
</li><li> Abner Doubledeal has appeared in three episodes — each time as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> bent on manipulating one of the main characters, but <em>also</em> each time in a different field. First he owned a pro wrestling promotion, then he owned the New New York Mets, then he was a TV exec.
</li><li> There's also the Grand Midwife from Kif's homeworld. She's also the Grand Priestess, the Grand Lunch Lady, the Grand Funeral Director, and the Grand Butterfly Curator. When Fry recognized her in her second appearance, she explained that she works five jobs. Each of them grand.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em>
<ul><li> Chuck and Leon, better recognized as The Chameleon Brothers.

Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animal</a> species is a dead giveaway to their ever-changing role.
</li><li> One main character, Filburt, spent a few episodes with different jobs before being promoted to a main major character. He has held at least nine different ones during the course of the series.
</li><li> Dr. Hutchison held a number of jobs in various medical fields before being promoted; upon meeting Dr. Hutchison, Rocko would invariably say, "Dr. Hutchison? I thought you were a [dentist/pharmacist/whatever job she had last]", to which she'd respond with laughter and a pun relating to the previous job: "I couldn't handle looking down in the mouth anymore!" One time, Rocko just said all the jobs at once, to which Hutchison replied, "Yeah... it's been a crazy year."
</li><li> In the 20 years between the series and <em>Static Cling</em>, Nosey went from a talk show host to a news reporter.
</li></ul></li><li> Rancid Rabbit of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em> is a fairly untrustworthy example of the trope, seemingly filling every authority position on the show. In one episode, he appears as both a teacher and a policeman. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Cat is a bit surprised</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Joshua</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Clarence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Clarence">Clarence</a></em> is a depressing version of this trope, winding up at a job in every place where his least favorite person, Clarence, is going. Whenever he's at work, expect something to go wrong.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">The Red Guy</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken">Cow and Chicken</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel">I Am Weasel</a></em>. One "I Am Weasel" episode has Weasel being sent to jail with Baboon by Baboon's lawyer (the Red Guy). At prison, he meets the jailer (also the Red Guy) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">accuses them of being the same person</a>, which causes the jailer to become nervous and dodge the issue.
<ul><li> It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">varied from episode to episode</a> whether Red Guy was one person changing jobs or a series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals">Inexplicably Identical Individuals</a>. In one "Cow and Chicken" episode, Red Guy himself ends up in jail, and meets the warden — who, as pointed out, looks exactly like him. Sadly, this was the end of the episode, so the gag didn't go any further. There was also the theme song which shows the Red Guy showing off his personas which are separate characters, although this could just be a gag.
</li><li> One episode showed Cow and Chicken moving out of their house and the Red Guy begs them not to go, as he'll no longer have anyone to pull his schemes on. This seems to imply it is in fact the same Red Guy.
</li></ul></li><li> Uncle Ruckus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em>, who is seen working in almost any low-wage service job you can think of; everything from ice cream trucks, to school buses, to janitorial duty, etc. He's mentioned that he holds down about 32-47 different jobs at the same time. There is no explanation for how he has time to do anything else (or sleep for that matter).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>: Mr Barkin seems to be the substitute teacher for every subject, coaches the football team, works part-time at Smarty-Mart, and is leader of a troop of Pixies (a Girl Scout analogue). This is lampshaded in an episode where they meet Mr. Barkin's father who works at a Living History community. The senior Barkin holds every single occupation in the village by himself, including churning butter. In a dress.
</li><li> Bruce, the effeminate guy with a mustache in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> is usually holding a job that usually ties with his "bleeding heart liberal sensible" persona. He's been a teacher, a faculty worker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropaholicsAnonymous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropaholicsAnonymous">a host for AA</a>, a psychic, a lawyer, etc.
<ul><li> Peter is an aversion, changing jobs during the show's run (including stints as a safety inspector at a toy factory, a self-employed fisherman, and a shipping clerk at a brewery) — but all have been addressed logically in the plot and he never comes with a new job out of nowhere, except in random flashbacks, though many of those are nonsensical, such as "providing night-time heat for Lara Flynn Boyle", or, "acting as Sandy Duncan's glass eye".
</li><li> Doubly so since the creators want to have him change jobs every couple of seasons since this is commonly the case in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/Pucca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/Pucca">Pucca</a></em>. He's had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> episode or two, but he's mostly there to be whatever strange job is needed, from ticket taker, to "guy in a frog costume." Since he only works his well-known job one day a year, he seems to have a lot of hobbies and side jobs.
</li><li> Jeremy <em>always</em> has a job nearby what's going on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>, usually at a concession stand chain in the series.

In addition, the title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">matches his name</a> (Culinary Quint, Counterfeiter Quint, and so on). There were identical twin Quints in one episode — a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InexplicablyIdenticalIndividuals">Inexplicably Identical Individuals</a>.

<ul><li> One episode revealed that the Mr. Men and Little Misses invoke this trope deliberately, getting new jobs every Tuesday.
</li></ul></li><li> Mr. Swindler of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em> has a number of jobs over the course of the series. He usually only changes jobs once in each episode he's in (the main job in which his subpar workmanship during most of the episode puts Jon off his business for a while, and the job that pops up in the last few seconds when he offers his services and they run away screaming), but in a notable exception, he had a series of home repair jobs. During each job, he set up the next job by causing a new problem. Eventually, Jon is exasperated into selling his house for a pittance. Garfield scares out Mr. Swindler by pretending to be a ghost, but he soon returns in ghost hunter gear... In one episode, Garfield says, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Aren't you the same guy in every episode?"</a>
</li><li> While on the subject of Garfield, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldSpecials">Garfield in Paradise</a></em>, suspiciously the same person who looks suspiciously like Frank Nelson is both a hotel clerk and a car rental agent.
<div class="indent"><strong>Nelson-type man:</strong> (as the rental agent) <em>Yeeeeeeeeeeeeehs?</em> <br/><strong>Jon Arbuckle:</strong> You look familiar. <br/><strong>Nelson:</strong> I have a brother in the hotel business. <br/><strong>Garfield:</strong> Racket is more like it.

The Generics always act like they've met for the first time.
</li><li> Jim Moralès from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em> may have a stable job now, but he's had a ridiculous number of jobs in the past, <em>21</em> in total, from sewer worker to basketball star to locksmith to B-Movie actor to <em>professional ping-pong player</em>. This all in addition to <strong>20 years</strong> as a gym teacher at Kadic. Every time someone brings up one of his old jobs, he tells them that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catchphrase">I'd rather not talk about it</a>." The catch phrase became the name of an episode, in which Jim gives the kids a run-down of some of his old jobs. Though there always seems to be some truth in these jobs, he still tends to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMunchausen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMunchausen">embellish his exact role</a>.
</li><li> Jonesy, a character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sixteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sixteen">6teen</a></em>, has a running gag of being fired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a>. He's also a main character, which is a tad rare.
<ul><li> One episode shows he has a resume consisting of some thirty pages of work history. He says this should help him get a job, but his friends point out he's never worked anywhere for more than a day. The sheer ridiculous size of the mall contribute to this.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of Jude</a>, if Jonesy had been able to work at Stick it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> before it was closed due to health reasons</span>, Jude would had fired Jonesy for sticking the wrong meat in the wrong stick despite their friendship.
</li></ul></li><li> Jimmy Witchard the violent brain-damaged man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> has a different job nearly every time we see him, a concession stand manager, garbage man, janitor, amateur artist, etc.
<ul><li> Peggy Hill as well. Originally a substitute Spanish teacher, she later took on other forms of employment such as a newspaper columnist, customer service representative, real estate agent, and so many more.
</li></ul></li><li> The first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> featured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">a pair of teenagers</a> named <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rugratonline.com/rrchar3c.htm#LarrySteve">Larry and Steve<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who would be working a job of some sort only to have the babies cause them to mess it up. Of course, the fact that they kept messing up their jobs no doubt explains why they kept changing them.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy">Goofy</a>'s whole schtick in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts">Classic Disney Shorts</a>. He's later joined by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>. Then again, Donald has had quite a lot of jobs himself, mostly due to his own incompetence.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em> series, Barney is never shown with a consistent job, though in later specials and series he is often shown working alongside Fred at Mr. Slate's quarry.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouchGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouchGag">gag credits</a> for the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> listed Kathryn Page as a different nonsensical crew member. These may all be part of her "real" job as one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIntern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIntern">interns</a>, as shown in another segment of the credits. Whether all these odd responsibilities mean she's more trusted than the other intern or a bigger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">target</a> is a matter of speculation.
</li><li> The old guy in glasses from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NedsNewt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/NedsNewt">Ned's Newt</a></em>. Began as a pet store owner, then continued to pop up in various roles. He even pops up at the beginning of one episode ("Summer Gone, Summer Not") to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">point this out</a>.

His official job description is being the station's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">"Everything"</a> (it's occasionally implied that he is actually a robot). Especially curious, considering that the station is the size of a large town and has fully stocked amenities (all run by Guy) despite their being a total of eight other residents.
</li><li> The recurring red mustache guy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em> holds many different jobs depending on the episode. Many of his jobs include working as a Nowhere police officer, an archaeologist, a captain, a pilot, a New York police officer, a ranger, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">soda vending machine</a>, a general, a pirate, and a mayor. He even sometimes had his hair and mustache changed to white.
</li><li> Yosemite Sam of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> fame. Starting out as a Western outlaw, he has since been a pirate, a prison guard, a Hessian, a claimjumper, a Medieval knight, a sheik, a politician, a Roman centurion, a Confederate officer, and many more.
</li><li> Inspector Willoughby, in the Walter Lantz cartoon shorts, until he became—well—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">an inspector</a>.
</li><li> Miss Rabbit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeppaPig">Peppa Pig</a></em> doing every random job is a running joke. One episode even lampshades this, with the Queen giving her the Award for Industry for having so many jobs and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">Narrator</a> listing just a few of Miss Rabbit's many, <em>many</em> jobs.
</li><li> Mr. Ford on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FriskyDingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FriskyDingo">Frisky Dingo</a></em>. He's been a mental hospital worker, a pet store clerk, gun store clerk, security for underground rabbit fights, polling consultant for Killface's presidential campaign, political analyst for a news show, US Secretary of State, and US President. Even shows up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> a few times.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Ford:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Yeah, my ass is everywhere isn't it?</a>

He can go from guarding doors to guarding bridges to even capturing sharks. So far he's doing a good job at it.
</li><li> Crunchy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em> Most of the time, he changes jobs because Dan makes him lose his in one way or another.
</li><li> Even though she's usually a singer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop">Betty Boop</a> is often shown working at different jobs in her cartoons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> has an episode where we meet a guy under the identities of Dock the ferryman, Xu the shopkeeper, and Bushi the river cleaner. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has it that he has a split personality because his mind is screwed up from the pollution in the river where he gets his water.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GrojBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GrojBand">Grojband</a></em> has a recurring character named Barney, who periodically provides plot-related help in an episode related to his job and what the band are doing. His hat always changes to his Job of the Week.
</li><li> A running gag in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeorgeAndMartha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeorgeAndMartha">George and Martha</a></em> was a certain creepy lizard guy always showing up as an employee of whatever franchise the titular hippos were frequenting. Usually right behind George.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Laurence "Larry" Needlemeyer is seen working in almost every video/video game store, a gas station, a grocery store, and a pizza place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> explained that he holds these jobs simultaneously and this was formally addressed a few times in the show:
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheAmazingWorldOfGumballS2E40TheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheAmazingWorldOfGumballS2E40TheFinale">"The Finale"</a>, he explains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily">the Wattersons</a> have caused so much property damage, he needs to have a ridiculous amount of income sources in order to pay for the repair of the shops he works shifts at.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheAmazingWorldOfGumballS3E25ThePizza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheAmazingWorldOfGumballS3E25ThePizza">The Pizza</a>, he has such a bad day at work that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OptOut">he quits his ALL of his jobs</a> and moves out of Elmore. Since he had practically every blue-collar job in the city, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VetinariJobSecurity">society crumbles down and the apocalypse begins</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">All within fifteen minutes</a>.
</li><li> In "The Schooling", Gumball and Darwin take Larry's jobs for a few minutes, showing how much he has to suffer daily. His list of work is extremely long. They switch from job to job by hearing the customer.
</li></ul></li><li> Rockwell "Rocky" Robinson fills pretty much every non-teaching, non-administrative job at Elmore Junior High, usually the janitor, the cafeteria worker, and the bus driver.
</li><li> Some minor characters also change their jobs from episode to episode, such as Gary Hedges (bus driver and mailman), Pantsbully (hot dog vendor, truck driver, cashier), and Karen (office worker at two buildings, town hall worker). In fact, almost every minor adult has had more than one job. The most common is a character working at Chanax Inc. and Rainbow Factory like Karen mentioned above, which are two different buildings, but any random minor adults can be slapped into either of those to fulfill the plot.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> this applies to Bolin. He goes from pro-bender, to mover star, to soldier, to police officer, to aide to the president, before leaving that last positon for yet another adventure with Korra. His brother Mako points this out, and Bolin recognizes this fact but goes anyway.
<ul><li> Ironically, Mako's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitherer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitherer">lack of romantic commitment</a> is what led both Korra and Asami to break up with him, so he is also sort of speaking from experience in a different arena.
</li></ul></li><li> Treeflower, Norb's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers">The Angry Beavers</a></em> always seems to have a new job, and new personality aspects to match. This is lampshaded in the episode where Norb and Dag try to tease her and end up being teased right back by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the tribe of female raccoons from an earlier episode.</span>
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PegPlusCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PegPlusCat">Peg + Cat</a></em>, Ramone seems to regularly change from one job to another.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Maisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Maisy">Maisy</a></em>, apparently little girl mouse, nevertheless does everything from being a doctor to flying a plane.
</li><li> This is used to great comic effect in "Strawberry's Big Journey" from the 2003 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrawberryShortcake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StrawberryShortcake">Strawberry Shortcake</a></em>. When the group meets Banana Candy, she is working as a mechanic. They ask if there's somewhere that they can get food and she directs them to a local cafe, and offers them a taxi... which turns out to be driven by her. When they get to the cafe, Banana Candy is making the meal, leading them to wonder just how the car is going to get fixed.
<div class="indent"><strong>Banana Candy</strong>: Small towns like this, you need a few jobs to make ends meet.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Those Two Guys</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfFigaroPho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfFigaroPho">The Adventures of Figaro Pho</a></em> take on many jobs, such as ballet dancing and ghost hunting.
</li><li> Mr. H, or Hollywood as he's referred to in the credits, is a recurring character on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwoStupidDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwoStupidDogs">2 Stupid Dogs</a></em> who tends to have a different job depending on the episode's plot. Substitute teacher, farmer, and actor are just some of the occupations he's assumed.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> first Season 1 finale "Gideom Rises", Gideon taking control of the Mystery Shacks means Soos has to get new jobs from scene-to-scene. First he's a short-order cook at a diner, and then a bus driver. After the episode ends, he resumes being a handyman.
</li><li> Mr. Smiley from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> has been an actor/R&amp;B singer, stand-up comedian, and seems to have worked at the Big Donut in the past. In the present, he's mostly seen working at Funland, where he apparently operates every ride, as well as the arcade, and has also appeared as a commentator for various events.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>: Bulk Biceps' first seen job, early in season 5, is as a masseur at the Ponyville Spa. But in season 6, he's shown teaching foals how to weight-lift, and early in season 7, he's shown selling cinnamon nuts out of cart. It turns out he "wears many hats" and is holding down multiple jobs at once.
</li><li> Pretty much the idea of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HuckleberryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HuckleberryHound">Huckleberry Hound</a>. Each cartoon in which he appears has him in a new occupation. His first cartoon had him as a policeman (which he held a couple of more times afterwards), followed by a Western sheriff, a sheepherder, a scientist, and much more.
</li><li> In each installment of <em>The Day Henry Met...?</em>, Henry meets an object or an animal such as a lighthouse or a rooster that has some sort of problem and decides to take an occupation to help them out, i.e. lighthouse keeper or farmer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Depending on the episode, the characters, especially Kaeloo and Mr. Cat, tend to have new jobs if the plot requires them to. One episode even lampshades this; after holding several different jobs through the episode, Kaeloo, as a police officer, arrests Stumpy and Quack Quack for robbing a bank, and then tells them that if they need an attorney for their court hearing, she'll be there to do that for them too.
</li><li> In the <em>Slimer!</em> segments of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>, Slimer sometimes ran afoul of a burly woman named Mrs. Stone, who has a different job every time she shows up. She's been a nurse, a lifeguard, a school guard, owner of an obedience school, and a judge at a dog show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Every season, the main characters (Bojack, Princess Caroline, Mr. Peanutbutter) get a new job.
</li><li> Todd is the king of this trope, in certain seasons getting a new job almost every episode. His occupations include: website executive, owner of an amusement park, owner of a year-round Halloween store, owner of a clown dentistry practice, owner of an Uber competitor, assistant to Mr. Peanutbutter, stagehand, prisoner, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> has recurring background character Theo. In his initial appearance (and biggest role), he was a sculptor. Since then, he's showed up passing out fliers for a play, as a roadie for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a> knock-off and a bike-rickshaw driver. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says it's intentional. He's still an artist, just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarvingArtist">Starving Artist</a>, and needs additional work to supplement his income.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaRama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDramaRama">Total DramaRama</a></em>, MacArthur of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRidonculousRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRidonculousRace">The Ridonculous Race</a></em> is always seen working different jobs in this series, including a juice shop employee, a zookeeper, an ice cream truck driver, and a chiropractor, among other things.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder19" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A lengthy resume — especially one where several short-lived jobs are indicated — may raise some red flags for potential employers, particularly if the applicant is not a college student.
</li><li> Lampshaded in one of Dane Cook's routines about "The Scary Guy at Work":
<div class="indent"><em>"Even now at your job, there is a freak. There is a weird guy at every job... And the strange thing about it is, it's </em>the same guy<em>, at every single job you go to. He's there, you quit, you go to the new job, and you're like "Oh my God, isn't that the guy from the other job?! 'It's the guy! THE SCARY GUY!'"</em>
</div></li><li> This is basically what being a hobo means. You wander from place to place, briefly taking whatever odd jobs present themselves.
</li><li> This is what many university students end up doing; either taking different jobs every summer or having to change jobs often to find one that balances with school hours.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Besides being a soldier, journalist, novelist, painter, and historian, within the British government he was Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, First Lord of the Admiralty, Undersecretary of State, President of the Board of Trade, Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Minister of Defense, Conservative Member of Parliament, and Liberal Member of Parliament. This doesn't include all the obscure honorary positions he accumulated, like Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports or Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was also a licensed bricklayer.
</li><li> Many high schools tend to do this by hiring an extra teacher whose specific job is to cover other teachers who're off sick, regardless of what the teacher's actually trained to teach.
</li><li> This actually was tried in the commune New Harmony, Indiana started by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Owen">Robert Owen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. He insisted doing this too, and became a baker... unfortunately everyone agreed that his bread was inedible. A sign that his idea wasn't that great, and subsequently, the commune faltered.
</li><li> This was the case for many people in the Three Kingdoms era, thought Deng Ai stand out in particular for achieving this kind of life after things had settled down and careers were fairly static. He started as a farmer, before becoming a local clerk before joining the central government. His first major assignment was an agricultural survey, in which he devised a large scale irrigation effort for several provinces. He was then made a military adviser, before being given his own command. As well as serving as a general, he would also go on to serve as the chief administrator of several regions throughout his life. He died after successfully conquering the kingdom of Shu, due to slander from his colleague Zhong Hui.
