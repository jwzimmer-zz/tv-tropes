</div></div><p>Mainstream Obscurity is what happens to a famous successful work intended for a wide general audience, that succeeds so well and becomes so known, that paradoxically, despite its fame, it remains relatively unknown to the general public. Sure it lands on every critic's top 10 list, has a fantastic word of mouth on many amateur review sites, and is one of the most truly well-known works in media, and some part of the media (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicOutfit">Iconic Outfit</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicItem">Iconic Item</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">Signature Scene</a>) is known by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a>. Thing is, these elements become so overexposed that a lot of people might <em>think</em> they've seen it, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereIsToKnowAboutTheCryingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereIsToKnowAboutTheCryingGame">might even feel they don't have to see it</a>, but individuals can't name things about it beyond these famous well-known aspects. A good example is a famous witticism that an intellectual is someone who can listen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GioachinoRossini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GioachinoRossini">Gioachino Rossini</a>'s <em>William Tell Overture</em> without thinking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLoneRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLoneRanger">The Lone Ranger</a></em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qkxf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qkxf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qkxf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">on account of the fact that the finale of Rossini's overture became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> used by the famous TV Show, becoming associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a> despite the fact that it derives from an Italian Opera about a Swiss Rebel, which, being that it's an opera, has a smaller audience</span>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>When the work has become so famous that "everybody else knows about it", yet no one has actually read or been exposed to that work, that work is wallowing in Mainstream Obscurity. People, groups, art movements, and entire genres can also be swallowed by Mainstream Obscurity. A "famous author" can be widely read, best-selling but largely unread, widely quote-mined, or just well known for "being an author". Iconic movie stars have their image reproduced in so many other places that it is easy to recognize their faces or get what part of them is being parodied and alluded to, without having to ever watch any of the movies they starred in. If a character portrayed by an actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">(or that version of a character, if an adaptation)</a> becomes more famous than their portrayer, the actor's name may be completely unknown to all except trivia buffs and paradoxically lead to extreme typecasting to the extent that an actor can't escape being pigeonholed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">or rather mine it for the rest of their life</a>. Likewise, people can be widely aware of an artistic movement or genre, but unable to describe what it was about.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>For this trope to hold meaning, a few conditions need to be met. It <em>must</em> be mainstream. Defining the mainstream is hard but a workable definition is that what is mainstream is the general knowledge and awareness in culture and society that people can have without having to go out of their way. A work for general audiences appeals to people who may not have, for instance, played other games, known or seen or heard of other works in said genre or other works in the said franchise, and likewise never have read a comic book, or listened to albums and artists of the given music genre. Likewise, one should not assume that a work is more famous than it actually is. Some works are likely not intended for mainstream appeal or mainstream audiences in the first place. For instance, works of philosophy, science, anthropology, and other social sciences, are not intended to be best-sellers, they are meant to be read and perused by peers and educated readers, and are likewise published in philosophical and scientific journals. Some scientists and philosophers owing to their great social and political influence end up becoming famous, their witticisms become proverbial in society by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> and so become a "known name" to people outside their field, but the fact is their works were never reasonably and realistically expected to be read unhindered by the non-specialist. So for instance, while Darwin is a famous scientist, and one cannot call him obscure simply because the majority of people who know his name haven't read his works. It would only be obscure if he is unknown among scientists and biologists, which obviously is not true.

The fact that some works become famous and known outside their intended audience is a case of coming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfTheGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfTheGhetto">Out of the Ghetto</a> or having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleDemographicAppeal">Multiple Demographic Appeal</a> rather than truly being obscure. Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolStudyMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolStudyMedia">School Study Media</a> features works and authors include bestselling authors from the 19th Century, and while many of them were once mainstream and obscure today, their appeal is strictly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAncient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsAncient">True Art Is Ancient</a>.
</p><p>The reverse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanMyopia">Fan Myopia</a>. Often happens when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> becomes so well known for being a cult classic (due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis">Popcultural Osmosis</a>) that the cult classic becomes mainstream. They may have started as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcclaimedFlop">Acclaimed Flop</a>. This can, of course, lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">Adaptation Displacement</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">Beam Me Up, Scotty!</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OsamuTezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a> is considered the "god of the manga." However there are many people (including anime fans) who know of his legacy and works, but have never read any of them; especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>, who is one of, if not the most recognizable manga characters of all time (and the first one to have a successful mainstream anime adaptation).
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira">AKIRA</a></em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">which is far better known than the manga</a>) has been hailed as one of the greatest animated films of all time, made $49 million at the box office and is very iconic, but there are plenty of people (mostly those who werent around for the initial release of the film) who are familiar with the major scenes and the memes they've spawned but have never actually watched the movie themselves and have no idea what the plot is about.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em> is well-known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a>'s</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingWorks">rival series</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1iret');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1iret" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1iret');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">given the existence of <em>Digimon</em> virtual pet toys  think Tamagotchis  in 1997 before <em>Pokemon</em> had gotten popular, it's more likely that the marketing was simply done similarly to leech onto <em>Pokemon</em>'s success</span>  and that's about it.

If you need to recognize them, they look like a yellow-orange dinosaur, a plant thing, a rodent with bat wings for ears, a pink bird, and a red dinosaur.</span>. To add, <em>Digimon</em> itself is only seen as a "rival" of Pokémon in America. In Japan, the people know the two are completely different franchises with different focus despite having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">Mons</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em> is well known as "<em>Evangelion</em> but even more depressing", along with being very philosophical, but few people have actually seen or read it.
</li><li> This trope even works in Japan: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> was met with critical acclaim in Europe and the USA, yet in Japan not so much. So it's no surprise that when Japanese actually talk about it, praising it about its greatness so they can associate with westerners, they might admit to having never actually seen the movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Air" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Air">Air</a></em>: Everybody knows that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Misuzu dies</span>, but not many have actually watched a single episode of the series.
<ul><li> And while we're in the same universe, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a> ~After Story~</em>.

</li><li> Detailed information about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon">Kanon</a></em> doesn't come up very often either, outside of internet memes like the infamously-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a> "am I kawaii uguu face" (which was actually the 2006 version edited to look like the lower-budget 2002 version). At least with the other two in the series (<em>AIR</em> and <em>CLANNAD</em>), people can name one or two plot points or characters, but they don't even know that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">uguu</a>" is actually from something.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em> is regarded as one of the best anime of all but not watched by many.

</li><li> Unsurprisingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze">Texhnolyze</a></em> is so dark and depressing that only a handful of people ever bring themselves to watch it.
</li><li> Everyone knows the famous Falcon Punch scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FZeroLegendOfFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FZeroLegendOfFalcon">F-Zero GP Legend</a></em>, but how many have actually watched the series?
</li><li> Within Belgium you have one based on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakuganBattleBrawlers">Bakugan Battle Brawlers</a></em>. Many people in Belgium have heard of it (though not necessarily liked it) and at least know that Bakugan is a game, but it is rare to find someone who has actually played it, let alone has the materials that are necessary to play with it. When a Belgian says that they exclude someone for not having a Bakugan they are simply searching for an excuse to exclude someone without outright telling the reason.
</li><li> Despite being one of the more popular anime series in general, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> doesn't seem to have been really watched by a lot of people, and common themes in fanworks (shipping characters who hate each other and/or barely interact, out-of-context jokes that became memes like "get in the robot," and making bit characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Ascended Extras</a>) have given popular culture some wrong impressions of the show. The <em>Rebuild</em> movies have helped this a bit (with many fans outright only watching them), but they in themselves hold obscurity. It doesn't help that, at least before Netflix got the license, there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">no legal way to watch the show in English</a> due to the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">being decades out of print.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> is likely writer Keiko Nobumoto's most famous work after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em>, but falls into the category of critically acclaimed and well-known but little seen outside of a small core of diehard fans due to its reputation for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">really</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsJesusInPurgatory">cryptic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker">really, really sad</a>.
</li><li> Sure <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano">Saikano</a></em> is known for being depressing, but it isn't actually watched or read that often.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru">Narutaru</a></em> has a bit of a reputation for its graphic violence and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon">Lolicon and Shotacon</a>-ish elements, but the <em>quality</em> itself is rarely discussed, probably since there aren't a lot of people who have actually read it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HaibaneRenmei">Haibane Renmei</a></em> was a well-known anime during the 2000s and was frequently cited on "must watch" lists. However, few people that praise it actually got around to <em>watching it</em>. Official streaming and home rereleases have helped this a bit though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> is "the" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> manga to people, thanks to it being the longest-running one to have official translations in various countries. People know it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> than the anime and even the games, but much else evade even many hardcore <em>Pokémon</em> fans. It doesn't get discussed much even on <em>Pokémon</em> forums.

<ul><li> If you ask any random person on the street across the English-speaking world to name a superhero, most could identify <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>. The fact that the latter belongs to a different company and universe (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>) was not a widely known fact (at least until the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em>). Indeed, non-comic fans will often wonder why Batman can't team up with Spider-Man. A lot of superhero comics like <em>Fantastic Four</em>, <em>X-Men</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, <em>Captain America</em>, <em>Captain Marvel</em> (the original, now <em>Shazam</em>), <em>The Flash</em>, <em>Wonder Woman</em>, <em>Buck Rogers</em>, <em>Flash Gordon</em>, <em>Judge Dredd</em>... are better known through their movie and TV series adaptations than the comics they originally appeared in. Most of the general audience - especially outside North America - knows up to nothing about these characters but: "yeah, they are superheroes who fight crime, I guess." Compare them to series like Superman, Batman, and Spider-Man, where a majority can at least tell you something about the characters or the backstory.
</li><li> <em>Amazing Fantasy</em> issue 15 featured the very first appearance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> ever, and it's one of the three most famous comic book issues in the history of superhero comics. However, most people who've heard of it don't know that it contained several back-up one-shot stories apart from the Spider-Man adventure, and even fewer have read any of them.
</li><li> If you name a female superhero, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> shows up often as an instant response, and most would know that she's Greek, has a Lasso of Truth, and flies an invisible plane (at least to those who remember the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LyndaCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LyndaCarter">Lynda Carter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WonderWoman1975">TV show</a>). Ask people about her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> and supporting cast, however, and that number drops. People can name multiple aspects of that information for Batman and Superman thanks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">success</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">of multiple</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superman">iterations</a>. Wonder Woman had one TV show devoted to her, then an appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> which streamlined her background (making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades">Hades</a> her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> and not Ares) and largely used her as part of an ensemble cast of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> rather than a hero in her own right as did the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCExtendedUniverse">DC Extended Universe</a>. She finally got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman2017">her own film</a> in 2017.
</li><li> Relatedly, everyone has the same general concept for the storylines of the heroes but said the concept is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">stuck somewhere in the 1970s to 1980s</a>, and in the case of a large number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcons</a>, confusing even among comics fans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>:
<ul><li> Superman is arguably the most famous superhero around. Most of the traits people associate Superman with (godlike power, the Fortress of Solitude, the Phantom Zone, Supergirl, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KryptoTheSuperdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KryptoTheSuperdog">Krypto the Superdog</a>, Zod, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>, multiple varieties of Kryptonite) were created during the Silver and Bronze Ages. The general public ignores that most of them were retconned out when DC rebooted Superman in 1985 and made their way back to the comics very slowly. Later additions to the mythos are mostly unknown by mostly everyone.
</li><li> They'll know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> is Clark Kent's friend and Superman's girlfriend who has no idea they're one and the same, unaware that they've been married for a long time in comics media, that she's fully aware of his secret identity, and that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em>, they came back to the married (and with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanSamuelKent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanSamuelKent">a child</a>) status. In the introduction to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">The Death and Return of Superman</a></em> omnibus, Mike Carlin noted the easiest way to shut down reporters complaining that they were "stealing" Superman from the people was to respond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">"Well... when's the last time ''you'' bought a Superman comic?"</a>
</li><li> Most people are aware of the existence of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em>, and most of them know her name's Kara and she's Superman's cousin. Even before being given <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supergirl2015">her own show</a></em> she had showed up in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Supergirl">live-action film</a></em> as well as several animated features, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">shows</a></em>, cartoons and video games. But ask them about her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a>, supporting cast, and relevant storylines, and they'll be hard-pressed to name one. They'll be unaware too that the character remained dead for eighteen years, during which DC tried and failed to replace her with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">several non-Kryptonian Supergirls</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> Unless they've been in a coma for a decade or two, they'll know who Batman is. But you'd be hard-pressed to find someone outside the hardcore fandom who knows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrantMorrisonsBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrantMorrisonsBatman">he now has a pre-teen son</a> with the daughter of one of his enemies. Likewise, said enemy and daughter of the said enemy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul">Ra's Al-Ghul</a> and Talia, were themselves highly obscure in Batman media (being that they are <em>recent</em>, created in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>) and when they were finally adapted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em> they were radically altered from their comics counterparts.
</li><li> For example: Ask anyone on the street who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Robin</a> is, and if they know at all, it'll be Dick Grayson, who's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> since 1984. They'll likely be completely unaware that there's been up to <em>five</em> Robins, depending on which comics you're talking about. They may also be unaware of the different identities each Robin has, and mention names like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHood">Red Hood</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedRobin">Red Robin</a>, and Spoiler to non-fans and they'll be stumped (though Red Robin might draw jokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">for sharing his name with a restaurant</a>).
</li><li> Ask anyone on the street who <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a></em> is and they'll name Barbara Gordon if they're able to answer the question at all. She's made appearances in live-action shows, movies, and cartoons. No one will know Barbara wasn't Batgirl for twenty-three years, and they'll be completely unaware of her successors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2000">Cassandra Cain</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2009">Stephanie Brown</a>, who have identities of their own (the former becoming Black Bat and then Orphan, the latter best known as the Spoiler). This is actually enforced by DC, who rebooted Barbara as Batgirl in order to make sure she's the "default" Batgirl in people's heads.
</li><li> You'd also be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't read comics that knows that Alfred isn't Batman's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a>. His parents' friend, Dr. Leslie Thompkins, is his maternal figure who helped Alfred raise him after their death. Like the al Ghuls, Leslie is a relatively recent addition from the 70s and she's only ever appeared in the flesh in one "mainstream" adaption, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em>. Even that is a pretty different take on the character. She is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper">Younger and Hipper</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">Jim Gordon's love interest</a>. She's also not the pacifist she is in the comics and even spends some time as a mob boss. Leslie has been referenced in some mainstream adaptations like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamSeries">Arkham games</a> but she's only ever appeared physically in two other adaptations, a few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanGothamByGaslight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanGothamByGaslight">Batman: Gotham by Gaslight</a></em> animated film. The former is still popular but she's not in any of the famous episodes and the latter is something that's marketed at existing fans. It doesn't help that she has a particularly (in)famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a> moment in the comics. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3g4do');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3g4do" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3g4do');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanWarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanWarGames">She let a teenager die to teach Batman a lesson about how kids shouldn't be fighting crime</a> </span>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>:
<ul><li> He's known as a member of the Justice League and as "Space Police", but most people wouldn't know anything about his character and origins, including the fact that Green Lantern is not a superhero name, but a job title, that there are multiple Green Lanterns of multiple species and multiple planets, and that there are now lantern-themed characters for every color in the rainbow.
</li><li> It was particularly notable when the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> TV show was launched in 2001 using John Stewart as the Green Lantern. Some were upset about them changing Green Lantern for a black man out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness</a>. People didn't know that the character was nearing 30 years old, having taken up the ring in the '70s. This, due to the popularity of the <em>Justice League</em> show, led to a large number of people confused by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> trailer, wanting to know why Green Lantern <em>wasn't</em> black!
</li><li> Likewise, Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern with the longest appearances in comics, is the "second Green Lantern". The first is Alan Scott, and the original Green Lantern had magic-based powers. Hal Jordan also disappeared from comics for nearly a decade with his replacement Kyle Rayner actually becoming "the" Green Lantern for many new readers. Of course, the failure of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> film means that Hal Jordan remains overshadowed in the popular imagination.
</li></ul></li><li> If you ask a random person who the quintessential <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">Avengers</a></em> are, you'll probably be told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>.
<ul><li> The problem is that the Avengers for a long time did not have a regular cast and roster. The first ten issues or so of the comics had repeated defections. The Hulk left the Avengers early and was a member of the team for exactly two issues, and unlike other team members did not rejoin for over 40 years after quitting (the team which Hulk had a longer membership in was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders">The Defenders</a></em>, which was finally made into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDefenders2017">Netflix series</a></em>). <em>Captain America</em> wasn't a founding member of the team, he was thawed out of ice in a later issue, and joined the team after that, and for a long time, the two most common founding members were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Ant-Man</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">The Wasp</a></em>, who were not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers (2012)</a></em> but when finally adapted were made into Scott Lang and Hope van Dyne, both of whom are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Characters</a>.
</li><li> A weird reversal of this occurred when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> was released. A large number of fans believed that the film was odd for not featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, even saying it's not the Avengers without them. Despite the fact that they were largely the two Marvel heroes most recognizable to the general public, both of them had only been full-time Avengers since 2005, and in fact, a good 40 years of Avengers history barely included either of them (Spider-Man became a reserve member in the early '90s but was rarely used unless all team members were being called in).
</li><li> Likewise, many see the Avengers as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCompanyEquivalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCompanyEquivalent">Alternate Company Equivalent</a> to the Justice League, and <em>the</em> prominent super-team. In actual fact, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em> is canonically the greatest team in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> and were originally intended to be the Marvel take on the Justice League. For most of its publication, <em>The Avengers</em> were far less popular and respected than the Fantastic Four and especially the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> and the reason for its regular roster was that it was seen as a dumping ground for B and C-Listers who generally couldn't carry a book or title on their own. Where in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></em>, Spider-Man wants to be an Avenger, in the original comics he wanted to join the Fantastic Four (rejected because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MisterFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MisterFantastic">Reed</a> said they were a family first and team second) and his closest relationship with anyone in the Marvel Universe was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HumanTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HumanTorch">Johnny Storm</a>. Granted, this has shifted in later years where the Avengers have become the premier team in the Marvel Universe, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">that wasn't until the early '00s</a> and most heroes have been an Avenger at some point in their careers after Marvel started promoting them more (what with the X-Men and Fantastic Four's film rights having been tied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyFox">20th Century Fox</a> for many years).
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a>, the character had fallen into this for most of his early history, up until 1986. While he did have his own successful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk">television series</a> and became something of a counter-cultural icon during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixties">the '60s</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://ew.com/article/2013/01/10/peter-david-the-incredible-hulk/">according to<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterDavid">Peter David</a>, the comics themselves suffered from very low sales to the point that the editor Bob Harras told him that Hulk was the book nobody wanted to write and handed it over to David out of desperation. It wasn't until David's landmark run on the title that Hulk comics started selling really well. That said, there are still readers today who feel that Hulk works better as part of an ensemble and that the number of stories he can carry by himself is limited. Truth be told, it still <em>does</em> apply to the Hulk, as there's little knowledge of what his comics version is like outside the fandom. Most people don't know Bruce can turn into a variety of Hulks due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">multiple personality disorder</a>, only one of which has the traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkSpeak">Hulk Speak</a> and childlike intellect (the Savage Hulk), that Bruce/Hulk has been married a few times, or that they've had two sons and a daughter (Skaar, Hiro-Kala, and Lyra, though Hiro-Kala isn't in any position to turn up easily). People who know the Hulk may not be able to mention one single villain from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a>, or just the Abomination.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> suffers from this, especially for modern audiences who are likely more exposed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">2003 animated series</a>, or for <em>really</em> young audiences who only know the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">gag version of it</a>. While it was one of the most successful and acclaimed comics of the '80s and has continued in some form to this day, the show was what introduced the team to modern audiences, and has been ingrained in the minds of many non-comic readers as the definitive source. There are several ways this shows:
<ul><li> Ask any non-comic fan what the lineup of the Teen Titans is, and if they can name any, they'll say, Robin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire">Starfire</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Raven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Raven">Raven</a>, and Beast Boy. In reality, this "core lineup" has never existed outside the animated series. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">the Teen Titans started in the '60s</a> and the founders were Robin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">Kid Flash</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aqualad</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a>. Starfire, Cyborg, and Raven hadn't yet even existed at that point. Even during the '80s, which had all of those five as members, it never was limited to <em>just</em> those five. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">the membership could get quite expansive</a> as new members would join and the lineup would shift a lot. While other members of the team did appear in the show, they were recurring/minor characters. The main reason why the main team was limited to those five in the show was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">avoid having too much to work within what is supposed to be children's television</a>.
<ul><li> Tellingly, even the 2003 comic revival meant to capitalize on the show's success and help introduce new readers to the Titans <em>still</em> didn't portray the lineup this way. Sure, it had Cyborg, Starfire, and Beast Boy, <em>and</em> Raven would join later, and it even had a Robin — but that Robin was Tim Drake, not Dick Grayson. Furthermore, it also featured Wonder Girl II, Impulse (who quickly became Kid Flash II), and Superboy. Some may have been confused as to who these people were.
</li><li> A hilarious illustration of this by audiences was during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52">New 52</a> relaunch of the Teen Titans. Many fans introduced by the show complained that it had none of the "original" members when the founding lineup was Red Robin, Wonder Girl II, Kid Flash II, Bunker, Solstice, Skitter, and Superboy. The only original member of the Teen Titans that's part of the "classic" lineup is Robin I, who later became Nightwing during his time with the Teen Titans. (The above lineup shares <em>none</em> of its members with the original Titans, or even the New Teen Titans, but still.) While that wasn't the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">only</a></em> issue people had, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">far from it</a>, it still showed how much people knew about the comic books versus the show. Admittedly, it probably wasn't very smart of DC to advertise a "new jumping-on point" and then leave out the most recognizable members of the team...
</li></ul></li><li> Terra is perhaps the most famous Teen Titan that isn't part of the "Big Five". They know she was a mole sent by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a>/Slade to infiltrate the Teen Titans. They also know she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a> who ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">regretted what she did</a> and did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">dying</a>. Again, that's strictly a product of the show. While it's true that Terra was an agent sent by Deathstroke (or "Slade") to infiltrate the Teen Titans, and Beast Boy (known as Changeling during this time in the comics) fell in love with her in both versions, the differences are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">astounding</a>. In the comics, she was <em>irredeemably</em> evil and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfJerk">Jerk With A Heart Of Jerk</a> who wouldn't stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">kicking the dog</a>, and her death in the comics wasn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, but rather a failed homicide when she tried to kill Deathstroke due to him "betraying" her<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4t3f7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4t3f7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4t3f7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Jericho briefly took over him to attack Terra</span>. While the whole scenario was Terra's tragedy in the show, in the comics it was strictly portrayed as Beast Boy's tragedy, not hers. In fact, even <em>Deathstroke</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">scared of how evil she was</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Barry Allen version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> is widely credited with kicking off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">The Silver Age of Comic Books</a> in 1956, but for most of the <em>actual</em> Silver Age he was never a top seller — throughout the 1960s all of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> stable outsold him by very heavy margins, with even the spinoff <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a> titles selling nearly twice as many copies per year. Likewise while the Flash is <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> hero and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> (i.e. his group of villains called themselves "the Central City rogues" and that led it to spread), a list of his villains (Captain Cold, Captain Boomerang, Weather Wizard, Gorilla Grodd) usually draws blank stares (though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrowverse">Arrowverse</a> gave them a bit of a publicity bump). Compounding the issue is the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> cartoon where the Flash is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">Legacy Character</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest">Wally West</a> and there are multiple people confused by why Flash has different names.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LifeInHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LifeInHell">Life in Hell</a></em> strip, an obscure precursor to his more famous offerings. Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Simpsons</a></em> fans know it exists, or can at least recognize the art style, but far fewer could name any characters or state what it's about. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in one of the comics, where Groening meets a fan who claims to love all his work but doesn't even recognize <em>Life in Hell</em>.
</li><li> Many of the iconic newspaper comic heroes of the 20th century, especially from non-English and non-American nations, fall into this category:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Becassine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Becassine">Bécassine</a></em>: In the French-speaking world <em>Bécassine</em> is an icon, one of the oldest comics around. But even though she is easily recognizable in France, most people of later generations have likely never read any of her stories and she is unknown in the rest of the world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KrazyKat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KrazyKat">Krazy Kat</a></em> is a cat who gets zipped with a brick by a mouse. Most comic book fans know this, but how many people have actually read these comics of an acquired taste?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleNemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleNemo">Little Nemo</a></em>: Everyone knows the scene where his bed is flying through the night or that he falls out of bed in the final panel, but how many people beyond that have ever read the stories? In this case, the anime movie adaptation, and the NES game based on it (obscure in their own right) are both more well known than the comic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleOrphanAnnie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleOrphanAnnie">Little Orphan Annie</a></em> is a well-known early 20th-century comic strip with an iconic art style. Despite this pretty much everything anyone knows about it comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Annie1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Annie1982">the first film of the musical adaptation</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The phenomenon can also be spotted in comic strips that have ended due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a> and are better known as publicity stills than for the comics themselves, which are only read by hardcore comics fans or older people who grew up with them. Examples are: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomPoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TomPoes">Tom Poes</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Pogo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Pogo">Pogo</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Nero">Nero</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CortoMaltese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CortoMaltese">Corto Maltese</a></em>...
</li><li> Non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">Superhero</a> comics from earlier eras have gotten hit hard by this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleLulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleLulu">Little Lulu</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">and the comics headlining Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge</a> in particular were at their prime some of the most beloved, critically-acclaimed and highest-selling comics of their time, to to the point where their writers (John Stanley and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a>, respectively) became well known themselves in spite of never being credited. These comics have largely been faded out of American culture; Little Lulu isn't well-known amongst the general public, and Donald and Scrooge are more well known for their animated appearances than for their comics appearances. Critics of the medium still hold these comics in high regard, however.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertCrumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertCrumb">Robert Crumb</a> is widely considered to be one of the most influential and important comic strip artists in the world and by far the only <em>underground comics</em> artist to still be a household name. That said, most of the general audience knows him more as that geeky <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a> in the hat and glasses, an image mostly derived from his comics. In the documentary <em>Crumb</em> (1994) the man himself is giving a slideshow explaining to a college audience the three things he is most famous for, all of them not indicative of the entire scope of his personality and oeuvre: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FritzTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FritzTheCat">Fritz the Cat</a>, the album cover of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapThrills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapThrills">Cheap Thrills</a></em> and the <em>Keep On Truckin</em> emblem. Fritz the Cat is better known nowadays for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a>'s film adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FritzTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FritzTheCat">Fritz the Cat</a></em>, which Crumb hated and caused him to kill Fritz off permanently in his next comic strip. <em>Cheap Thrills</em> has led him to be associated with the hippie culture, a subculture he never liked, especially not the music. And <em>Keep On Truckin</em> also gave him legal problems because tax administrators thought he held the copyright, which he didn't. Needless to say: all these three things are more indicative of Crumb's work in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> than the more mature and personal, autobiographical work he has made since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>.
</li><li> Cartoonist Ronald Searle is best known for <em>St. Trinians</em>, a cartoon series he only drew for four years in a versatile career that spanned more than half a century. Try to ask anyone what else he has done in his life and you probably get a blank stare.
</li><li> Most people in the USA may know that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> are universally popular European comics, but know next to nothing about it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> is an American icon and the characters are well-known in pop culture (especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a> dynamic). But how many people have read over five issues, excluding popular spinoffs like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie">Afterlife with Archie</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieVsPredator">Archie vs. Predator</a></em>? The fact Reggie is often forgotten by people despite being one of the main five characters really shows people that genuinely read <em>Archie</em>. This often leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">Adaptation Displacement</a>, resulting in people thinking the 1990s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> was an original sitcom and not an <em>Archie</em>-verse adaptation.
</li><li> Not too many people will think of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> comic book without immediately thinking of the show.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeMeWannaShout">screaming powers</a> and she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a>'s love interest. Even many casual DC fans know her design and she's had appearances in various adaptations, but anything besides the basics tends to get mixed up. She's often mistaken for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">relatively new character</a> when she (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">an incarnation of her</a>) dates back to the 1940s. Even her name has this issue thanks to <em>Arrow</em> popularizing her as "Laurel" (which is her seldom-mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiddleNameBasis">middle name</a>) instead of the comic's "Dinah".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> and Dave Gibbons is interesting in that many people think that it's more mainstream and less obscure than it really is. While the original comic was a success, it never sold as well as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanTheDarkKnightReturns">Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</a></em> and for that matter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheManOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheManOfSteel">The Man of Steel</a></em> and it had far less of a cultural impact than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDeathOfSuperman">The Death of Superman</a></em>. The adult content and lack of recognizable names, as well as the dependence on a certain familiarity with superhero concepts, gave it a unique niche that made it successful and influential on media creators but it never became a "brand" despite remaining in print since the '80s. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a>'s film was likewise a commercial failure, albeit it still informs most people's ideas of <em>Watchmen</em> even if it made more than a few notable changes despite being generally faithful to the plot and look of the book.
</li><li> This is also true for most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s work. His works sell well and he's famous but they remain for the most part niche and cult works, better known by their movie adaptations. Even then, of the movies based on his works, only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em> became a commercially successful adaptation, which was again very different in significant respects from his comic. His most famous period is still the DC Comics era, which was only a brief five year stretch from his earlier career, and even then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKillingJoke">The Killing Joke</a></em> is his most influential work (inspiring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a>) despite the fact that he wrote more stories on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> than on Batman.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em> is often considered the quintessential gritty cop movie, and is so well known that to this day people make Dirty Harry references whenever Clint Eastwood's name is mentioned. Everyone knows that Eastwood played the role, and they know that he said: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuddenImpact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuddenImpact">Go ahead, make my day</a>" when begging a perp to give him an excuse to shoot him. They're also familiar with his catchphrase "You feelin' lucky, punk?", even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">that's not what he said, nor was it a catchphrase</a>. They know he and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaChief">chief</a> were constantly at odds, and...that's about it. Your average person could not name any of the films aside from the first one, the supporting cast, or even Harry's last name! (Callahan, for the record.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> films are a particularly good example of this. Due to pop culture status (as well as being one of the biggest movie franchises of all time), it's safe to assume that the majority of people actually know who Godzilla is. That being said, however, try asking someone who isn't a die-hard fan to name at least one Godzilla film and see what happens. Even fans of the genre might not realize that the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1954">Gojira</a></em> was a dark somber allegory rather than a cheesy "monster on the loose" film, since its original American release as <em>Godzilla</em> (with Raymond Burr) was recut to be exactly that. A subtitled release of the film the Japanese saw back in the 1950s was not available to Americans until this century. It doesn't help that, due to Western media's overbearing popularity, not to mention accessibility, over Japanese productions, a lot of people are only familiar with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">1998 American remake</a> (which, while mostly hated in its native country, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">was actually quite successful in international markets</a>) and have little to no idea that the franchise, in reality, originated from Japan and has had a firm fanbase way before that movie. This was mitigated <em>a bit</em> with the release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">the 2014 American film</a> — at least in that more people <em>know</em> about its roots, not that they would actually want to watch any of the "shoddy Asian rubber monster movies". Even the 2014 film still receives the effect of this. For instance, plenty of people tend to complain about Godzilla's short appearances, which is actually as much as how he appeared in earlier films.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a>-nominated films are like this, particularly ones nominated for Best Picture. The titles and (usually) the premises become known in the American conscience when they're nominated, and yet, few people can say they've seen more than a couple, maybe even <em>any</em>. This results in many people buzzing about films they have never seen, and probably never will, and this carries on into a new batch of films the following year as the previous winners and nominees are largely forgotten.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em>. American pop culture status has made it so that mainstream audiences are somewhat familiar with the basics of the film. And everyone knows it's the uncrowned <em>queen</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a> films. That, and, playing the Time Warp every Halloween helps. However, again, ask someone who isn't a fan of what the plot of the movie is. Most likely, the answer you'll get is, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimCurry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimCurry">Tim Curry</a> in drag." The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceParticipation">Audience Participation</a> within the film also counts. Sure, people, in general, know you're supposed to use props and yell certain lines when watching the movie. But, ask anyone who isn't a die-hard fan what you're supposed to say and when.
</li><li> How many people have actually seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen">Soylent Green</a></em>? But everyone knows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereIsToKnowAboutTheCryingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereIsToKnowAboutTheCryingGame">it's made of people</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">Film Noir</a> is well known. Few can even list some titles like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMalteseFalcon1941" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMalteseFalcon1941">The Maltese Falcon</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigSleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigSleep">The Big Sleep</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurderMySweet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurderMySweet">Murder, My Sweet</a></em>. But even these famous titles are little seen except by parody and they give a false impression of Noir Cinema since most of them were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">second-class movies</a> and only a smaller number of them have a private detective as heroes (most of them have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a>). In the case of <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, the final line, "The stuff that dreams are made of" has even been used in jewelry commercials, which considering the context of the original scene<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02fne');"><sup>spoilers from the film </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note02fne" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02fne');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Maltese Falcon is fake and when Bogart's Sam Spade says it's the stuff dreams are made of, he's noting that all dreams are as fake as that falcon</span>, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">Comically Missing the Point</a>. For a bonus point, the "Stuff that dreams are made of" line originates from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest">The Tempest</a></em> but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a>, it is associated, as in the case of the Lone Ranger and Rossini, with the Maltese Falcon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Plan9FromOuterSpace">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a></em> is the most famous cinematic example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a>. Yet more people are familiar with it thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EdWood">Ed Wood</a></em> than those who've actually seen it. Outside the USA most people who saw "Ed Wood" are probably not even aware <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdWood">Ed Wood</a> really existed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">and his films were ''really'' that badly made</a>.
</li><li> Certain actors from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfHollywood">The Golden Age of Hollywood</a> were once so ubiquitous that they are little seen by the general public but remain famous on account of countless imitators of their voices, personas, and references to their famous roles:
<ul><li> On an individual level, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDean">James Dean</a>'s career. He's one of the most iconic actors of America, someone who codified the bad-boy teen hero seen in endless American movies. But ironically, the people who tend to see his movies — <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RebelWithoutACause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RebelWithoutACause">Rebel Without a Cause</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EastOfEden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EastOfEden">East of Eden</a></em>, or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Giant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Giant">Giant</a></em> — are actually quite old, and in some cases, of a much nerdier disposition (i.e. cinephiles) than the archetype Dean embodied and inspired (i.e. the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigManOnCampus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigManOnCampus">Big Man on Campus</a> cool kid).
</li><li> Can you describe what one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyTemple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShirleyTemple">Shirley Temple</a>'s films was about without saying something like, "Well, she sang 'Animals Crackers In My Soup' in some movie I don't know the name or plot of"?<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5yd61');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5yd61" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5yd61');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That movie is <em>Curly Top</em>, by the way.</span> She is more recognizable as a 1930s Hollywood glamour icon than the number of people who saw her movies. Ironically enough, it's likely she is now more famous for her turn in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnFord">John Ford</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortApache" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FortApache">Fort Apache</a></em> known among Western fans and movie-buffs who generally tend to deprecate her work as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerChildStar">Former Child Star</a> (whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> were mocked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamGreeneAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamGreeneAuthor">Graham Greene</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Many young people, in general, will often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/RoleAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/RoleAssociation">associate a certain actor or director with their latest work</a> because they never bother to watch any of their earlier and better works or are even unaware of it. As a result, certain iconic actors and directors will often be perceived by younger people as "old, uncool has-beens" of which they don't understand what made them so important or celebrated in the first place? A good example would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro">Robert de Niro</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackNicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, who once appeared in a lot of intelligent cinematographic masterpieces and/or good movies in general, but are nowadays cashing in checks by playing parts in forgettable movies where they just play themselves. (Not to mention playing gimmicky, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Large Ham</a> comic-book roles that were often completely anathema to their former screen personae, which many film historians claim began with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a>'s star turn in <em>Superman</em>.) So in that regard they are still recognizable to many people, but mostly for being a tabloid mainstay or someone interviewed at the red carpet, not for their most acclaimed work.
</li><li> This applies to famous comedians from the silent era, many of whom originated iconic bits of slapsticks and visual gags that <em>still</em> get laughs decades and even a century after they are introduced. These gags are reused in countless movies and TV-Show but few have seen the original:
<ul><li> Everybody is able to recognize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> and knows he starred in slapstick movies. But for modern audiences: how many people have actually ever watched and enjoyed any of his films compared to his international fame? Let alone those who know he didn't really look like the Tramp in real life.
</li><li> The scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SafetyLast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SafetyLast">Safety Last!</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldLloyd">Harold Lloyd</a> is hanging from a clock is far more famous than the rest of this film, let alone Lloyd himself. Only a few genuine trivia buffs can tell that Clark Kent's famous look was based on Llyod's "glasses persona".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BusterKeaton">Buster Keaton</a>: He is most famous today for the landmark gag in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SteamboatBillJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SteamboatBillJr">Steamboat Bill, Jr.</a></em> in which the front of a house's facade falls on him, but his character survives because he neatly fits into a small opening. This gag is repeated countless times and still shows up in visual comedy but his films are more obscure, especially the lesser-known ones (like <em>The Cameraman</em>).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Marx Brothers</a> are famous for their dedicated fans and people who actually sat down and watched any of their movies. To the modern, general public Groucho's face may ring a bell, his and Harpo's names may too, but that's about it. Some of their scenes are well-known, like <em>Why a duck?</em>, the mirror gag from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DuckSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DuckSoup">Duck Soup</a></em>, and the crowded stateroom scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightAtTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightAtTheOpera">A Night at the Opera</a></em>, but not everybody may be able to point to them as the originators. Some younger viewers may know them from being references in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a> movies, and even Woody Allen complained when he made <em>Sweet and Lowdown</em> and his lead actress Samantha Morton claimed not to know who Harpo Marx was.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingJohnMalkovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeingJohnMalkovich">Being John Malkovich</a></em> has an in-universe example with the titular actor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">who plays himself</a>). Everyone in the movie admires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMalkovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnMalkovich">John Malkovich</a> immensely, and they seem convinced that he's one of the world's greatest living actors. None of them can actually name a movie that Malkovich has been in (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">except "that jewel thief movie," which Malkovich insists he wasn't in</a>).

However put certain images and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene">Signature Scene</a> together — A giant chimp in Manhattan who climbs a tall building, beats his chest in defiance and fights off planes while holding a blonde girl in his fest, and dies by dropping off the tallest building in the world, which at the time it <em>was</em> the Empire State Building. Empire State no longer holds that honor but it remains an iconic building thanks to Kong and is still remembered for being "the tallest" at one point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlacesInTheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlacesInTheHeart">Places in the Heart</a></em> — a.k.a. the movie that won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SallyField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SallyField">Sally Field</a> the Best Actress Oscar in 1985 is far less famous today than her embarrassingly narmy Oscar acceptance speech, which thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">Beam Me Up, Scotty!</a> is remembered as "You really like me!" (And who remembers the <em>first</em> film that won her the same honor, 1979's <em>Norma Rae</em>?)

Yet everyone knows who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GrandVizierJafar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GrandVizierJafar">Jafar</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> are, and has seen characters that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeCesare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeCesare">look like Cesare</a>.

A fair share of them remembers the fact that it was a pretty violent series.

Her other nicknames include Dolly and Lo. The book doesn't really live up to its scandalous reputation, either, being that it's a richly written, highly allusive novel about the clash between decadent Europe and modern America.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zorro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Zorro">Zorro</a> presents an interesting case. In the book <em>The History of Mystery</em> by Max Allan Collins, Collins asserts, on page 51, that Johnston McCulley's Zorro rivals Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan for influence. While one can easily find Burroughs novels in mainstream bookstores today, Johnston McCulley's work has fallen out of print. This seems baffling, considering that values dissonance would seem to apply less to Zorro, given that having a Latino (albeit a <em>white</em> Latino) protagonist who seeks retribution for injustice against Native Americans seems progressive. It also seems baffling considering that in the last twenty years, Zorro has had two feature films in theaters, as well as a few TV series, while other properties set in the Old West such as <em>The Lone Ranger</em> and <em>Hopalong Cassidy</em> have remained cinematically inert.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7vudm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7vudm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7vudm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Also note that Zorro's adventures take place even earlier in history than those of <em>Hopalong Cassidy</em> or <em>The Lone Ranger</em>.</span> Also, Zorro costumes still remain quite common for children. Despite all of that, Johnston McCulley's books are now rarely in print.

Plenty of people have read them, but far, far more people are aware of him than have read any of them, or get the wrong impressions from adaptations and sundry works that make him a Victorian superhero. The original Sherlock was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero">Small Steps Hero</a> who largely tackled small cases rather than solving murder mysteries.

Averted with the movies, as the great majority of moviegoers have seen at least one of the <em>Bond</em> films at some point during the last 50 years.

It doesn't help that the novel became more famous (or infamous) for its association with John Hinckley Junior and Mark David Chapman than for any actual content in the novel.

His publisher explains that there are fewer people reading books <em>at all</em> than the number of books sold — but it simply became a fashion to have it at home.

Coming to the original texts after those can yield a lot of surprises. (Silver Shoes instead of Ruby Slippers? Peter Pan and Pinocchio are colossal jerks?) So few people realize that there are original, definitive versions of the stories that they become, in the public consciousness, fairy tales, and folklore rather than the work of individual authors. Moreover, <strong>all</strong> of these works have other media adaptations and variations, some to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationOverdosed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationOverdosed">Adaptation Overdosed</a> — especially in their countries of origin — which haven't been subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a>.

Basically, the main reason it bombed was that it was too much like the books, and not enough like the film most people are familiar with.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFenimoreCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesFenimoreCooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a> was the first American writer to achieve massive commercial success abroad and to exert an influence on the leading writers of his day. <em>The Spy</em> is considered the first substantial novel of American literature and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeatherstockingTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLeatherstockingTales">The Leatherstocking Tales</a></em> are considered classics that for instance shaped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">The Western</a>.

These days, it's a rare bird indeed who have experienced the original Walter Gibson novels, or <em>any</em> of his numerous radio, comic book, and film adaptations (even the Alec Baldwin joint was ill-attended).
</li><li> Pity <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UncleTomsCabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a></em>, now known only as of the origin of the slur "Uncle Tom", which actually has little to do with the anti-slavery novel and everything to do with the pro-slavery minstrel parodies of it. Ironically, <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> was, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, the best-selling book of the nineteenth century in the U.S.

Thanks to later adaptations which gave it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate">Setting Update</a>, many assume that it's written in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> or originated as pulp fiction when it was actually quite respectable and valued by readers across genres in its day and age.

Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">Adaptation Displacement</a> with its more family-friendly 1980s film, most don't realize that the original book is actually a quite adult story with <em>heavy</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerRomance">Queer Romance</a> elements.

That the series has been damn near plagiarized by many much more famous works seems to be unknown to all but Michael Moorcock himself; How many know that the forces of Chaos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> are based almost wholly on those in the Elric stories, to the extent that even the 8-pointed star of Chaos originates from the Elric stories?

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays, and many people will probably be able to quote a couple of scenes, like "To be or not to be" or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorYorick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorYorick">Alas, Poor Yorick</a>. But most will never have read the play or seen it performed on stage. They just know that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodysDeadDave">everyone dies</a>, and it had something to do with Yorick. This can be extended to <em>all</em> Shakespeare plays, though a few of them (including <em>Hamlet</em>) are often taught at schools in English-speaking countries (frequently accompanied by field trips to see them performed). The most blatant Shakespeare example is actually <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. It seems to be remembered by pop culture as a tragic tale of true love, and the "Wherefore art thou Romeo" scene, but otherwise you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who knows the plot in any kind of detail.
</li><li> Everyone knows about Sun Tzu's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtOfWarSunTzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtOfWarSunTzu">The Art of War</a></em>, which could arguably be the most well known military book ever, mostly after it was discovered and adopted by corporate schools and businessmen and repurposed as a self-help book. But they almost certainly haven't read it in full, and probably don't even know that it's very short and reads mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">like a poem</a>.
</li><li> Likewise, Clausewitz' <em>On War</em> and Guderian's <em>Achtung - Panzer!</em> are known for just two things. That they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">important works about military strategy and tactics</a> and that they were written by Germans. In the case of "On War", maybe someone will be able to recall its most famous quote — <em>War is the continuation of politics by other means</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales">The Canterbury Tales</a></em> by Geoffrey Chaucer, though it's pretty common reading in colleges, although even there, a few of the Tales tend to be skipped since for logical reasons, it is incomplete and only a few of the tales are even really good (and some of them are anti-semitic).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost">Paradise Lost</a></em>. Most people know the name and can quote "Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven," though they don't know from the context that it's not supposed to be taken at face value, especially since Satan doesn't really <em>reign</em> anywhere. Hell is his prison, not his palace.
</li><li> Even among communists, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a> was hardly widely read. Anti-Communists frequently act as if <em>Das Kapital</em> (it is famous for its German title as opposed to "Capital", its English title) is the Bible for Commies. In truth, the most widely read work of Marx is <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> precisely because it is short, and it was a summary intended for general readers and so simplifies Marx's complex ideas. <em>Das Kapital</em> is an incomplete work, only the first volume was published in Marx's lifetime, and it's a 500+ page book of dense economic theory full of tables and formulae, not amazing socio-economic rhetoric.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NiccoloMachiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a>. Everyone has heard of him, or at least the adjective that he spawned.

Even most people who have read <em>Inferno</em> never bother to read the other two books. Bonus points if they know it's 'Inferno' written by Dante, and not just <em>Dante's Inferno</em>. More points to people who are aware that it isn't official church canon; then again, it <em>is</em> the (co-)<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Word of Dante</a>.

Only one classical author comes anywhere near managing to avoid this trope — our old friend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">multiple trope namer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aesop">Aesop</a>, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AesopsFables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AesopsFables">fables</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">Bowdlerised</a> as they might be, are still read to kids all over the world. The Coen Brothers managed to adapt <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOdyssey">The Odyssey</a></em> into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OBrotherWhereArtThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OBrotherWhereArtThou">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a></em> without ever reading it.
</li><li> It should be noted that in most of Europe (meaning France, Belgium, and Germany, for instance) Latin works avert this due to being taught in Latin classes, which are popular with students seeking higher forms of language education. With Greek works however it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played straight</a>, while they get passing reference in Latin and some excerpts are read in their translated forms they are only feverishly analyzed and studied in Greek lessons, which scare most people off due to the foreign alphabet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Faust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Faust">Faust</a></em> isn't a straight example, being derived from German folk legends, with no definitive, seminal work moving it into the literary canon. However, most subsequent works did derive from the plays by Marlowe (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTragicalHistoryOfDoctorFaustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTragicalHistoryOfDoctorFaustus">The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus</a></em>, 1604) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Faust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Faust">Faust</a></em>, 1808/1832), and, more importantly for this trope, the majority of people know <em>Faust</em> entirely through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis">Popcultural Osmosis</a>, and few have read any of the source material. Unless you're German. Unlike most classic works on this page, Goethe's <em>Faust</em> is the one book everyone has to read in school in Germany. Even if it's just a few passages. Bonus points for the fact that the younger generation<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1061lm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1061lm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1061lm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">save for Germany as above</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosisFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosisFailure">is more likely to link the name</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenFaust">Faust</a> with various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation">Western Animation</a> series of the 2000s and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>.
</li><li> <em>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</em> by Edward Gibbon. It is a rather hefty beast, running to six volumes. Historians <em>do</em> read it, as it is still considered authoritative in many respects, and also because it is the earliest such work to actually reference and cite sources. We tropers tend to pick up the title through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a>, amplified by the fact that every title with "decline and fall" or "rise and fall" is, ultimately, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking">Stephen Hawking</a>'s <em>A Brief History of Time</em> has sold more than 9 million copies and is probably the first thing people think of when anyone mentions Stephen Hawking (aside from his voice), but is often cited as an example of an "unread bestseller". Hawking mentions this in his 2013 autobiography <em>My Brief History</em>, stating that "It has been suggested that many people bought the book to display on the bookcase or on the coffee table, without having actually read it". Those who have read the book tend to mock others for making a big deal since it is indeed a "brief" history, a short book on physics for the general reader, with highly simplified language free of jargon, and many simple analogies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HunterSThompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> is the first name that anyone thinks of when the term "Gonzo journalism" is thrown about, and "Fear and Loathing in X" has become a veritable pop-culture snowclone, but you'd be hard-pressed to find many who've read the book in question (there's also an element of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">Adaptation Displacement</a> at play here) or any of his other works. In fact, many so-called "fans" of Thompson like him more for the fact that he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a> who liked to smoke, drink, take drugs and shoot his gun a lot, rather than having read any of his novels.

That is, besides <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pygmalion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pygmalion">Pygmalion</a></em>, and even that one probably mostly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFairLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFairLady">film adaptation</a> which has arguably itself moved into this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelBeckett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamuelBeckett">Samuel Beckett</a> is known for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WaitingForGodot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WaitingForGodot">Waiting for Godot</a></em> and most people know two characters wait for Godot, who never arrives. His other plays are not as well known, and the novels, which are what defined his literary career...well, they tend to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesJoyce">James Joyce</a></em> look accessible.
</li><li> Many fairy tales also fall into this trope. Most people know only the classic stories and not the more obscure tales by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrothersGrimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrothersGrimm">The Brothers Grimm</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights">Arabian Nights</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesPerrault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesPerrault">Charles Perrault</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HansChristianAndersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephJacobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JosephJacobs">Joseph Jacobs</a>. Even the more iconic stories are better known in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">bowdlerised</a> versions, made popular by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a>, which often have little to do with the originals. The general public has never read the entire collected fairy tales of these authors from the first page until the last and would probably be amazed that a lot of these stories aren't exactly that child-friendly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nostradamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a>' <em>Prophecies</em>: Many people have heard of Nostradamus and know he predicted future events, but the amount of people who've actually tried to <em>read</em> his "Prophecies" (even in translation) is much, much lower. Anyone who ever did quickly comes to the conclusion that none of it is as clear, accurate and specific as his reputation pretends it to be.
</li><li> Most people have heard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, a.k.a. the guy who invented the gothic horror genre. Not so many have actually read any of his works.

<ul><li> This is true of virtually the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> <em>oeuvre</em>: his film of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> was his very first work to achieve mainstream popular success. The foremost example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>: Because of its attractive star and support from critics, it's not exactly ignored by the press. The name also makes it very memorable. Finally, there's generally a lack of A) canonical vampire slayers and B) female leads in genre programs, so Buffy the character usually finds a niche in pop culture conversations. However, the show <em>itself</em> was never highly watched in its prime. People also don't remember some of the highlights of Whedon's early career, such as writing a good deal of the dialogue for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em>. And practically no one has ever heard of his father and grandfather, even though they were also television writers (and the grandfather actually wrote for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Leave It to Beaver</a></em>!).
<ul><li> Ironically, the above also applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">the 1992 film</a> that introduced the world to the Buffy character in the first place. There are probably plenty of non-<em>Buffy</em> fans who are <em>vaguely</em> aware of its existence, having <em>maybe</em> seen it in a video store once or twice...but they couldn't mention anyone who was in it, despite one of those people being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LukePerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LukePerry">Luke Perry</a>. Or another one of those people being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulReubens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulReubens">Paul Reubens</a>. Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition">two more of those people</a> being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck">Ben Affleck</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilarySwank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HilarySwank">Hilary Swank</a></em>!
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheCW">The CW</a> seems to be all about this. "TV to talk about," but not necessarily TV to <em>see</em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>, for all its buzz, rarely draws more than a couple million viewers a week. Averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em> to an extent.
</li><li> Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AMC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AMC">AMC</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> are standard name-dropping fare for people wanting to seem cultured, but continue to get mediocre audiences (even for cable) for shows with so many Emmys. Though the latter ultimately averted this near the end of the series <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note122ti3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note122ti3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note122ti3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Season 5B was watched consistently by a rather large number of viewers for a cable show, breaking its rating record five times. Most notably, the series finale was watched by 10.3 million viewers, the most-watched finale for a cable show since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em>'.</span> Having its first 5 seasons streaming on Netflix and excellent word-of-mouth no doubt helped to promote it to a wider audience in time for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>. AMC's third hit series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, on the other hand, averted this from the beginning.
</li><li> There are very few people who have seen acclaimed shows like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> in full, yet because it is the general opinion of critics, they immediately proclaim them "the greatest TV show ever made" after watching the first few episodes. This is silly, given that it's a very slow-burning show which takes several episodes to get going. In general, shows on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HBO">HBO</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Showtime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Showtime">Showtime</a> tend to have this problem, in part because they are higher tier networks that people have to pay extra for, thus meaning that most people can't see them legally until they come out on DVD.
</li><li> This often occurs with certain episodes of some TV shows, many people have probably seen these shows since they often relive in syndication and on TV Land long after cancellation, but not necessarily episodes often cited as classics.
<ul><li> Most people could probably say that "Lucy Does a TV Commercial" is commonly considered the best <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> episode, but not anything beyond about it besides the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">obvious said in the title</a>.
</li><li> Similarly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em> episode "Chuckles Bites The Dust" has often been cited as one of if not <em>the</em> funniest TV episode of all time...but how many who are aware of that "fact" have even seen it or any episode of the show? In a similar vein, the show's theme song and opening sequence are far more recognizable than anything about the actual show.
</li><li> Even the case for more recent shows. Everyone who was born before or during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> was on the air has seen an episode in syndication at least once, but that's not necessarily "The Soup Nazi". However, everyone can state the basic premise of the episode or quote the character's famous catchphrase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ellen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ellen">Ellen</a></em> is almost always thought of as "that show where the lead character came out". If you were very young or not yet born in the '90s, you might be forgiven for assuming it was, from beginning to end, a show about a woman coming to terms with her sexuality, when in fact for three seasons it was a somewhat run-of-the-mill Seinfeldian "comedian gets a sitcom"-type show, and it wasn't until the end of the third season that she came out, then spent exactly one season focusing on her being an out lesbian before being canceled.
</li></ul></li><li> Everyone knows <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em> was weird and focused on the question of who killed someone named Laura Palmer, but not much beyond that is remembered. This may be for the best, since it prevents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">the killer's identity from becoming common knowledge</a>, allowing new viewers to properly experience the mystery for themselves. And it actually got terrific ratings in its day, and its third season "The Return" is seen as a fitting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePrisoner1967">The Prisoner (1967)</a></em> was the show with the guy and the giant balloon, right? And he had, like, a jacket, and he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNumberSix">a number</a> or something?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em>: most people know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a> only for their films and even in that case solely for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em>. The amount of people who actually watched the TV series is far lower. It's safe to say that although Monty Python has a small, but dedicated geeky fan base the general public has probably only watched about half an episode of the in total four seasons before deciding it's too weird or they just didn't get it. Probably more people are familiar with their most popular and accessible individual sketches, like the <em>Dead Parrot</em>, <em>Lumberjack Song</em>, <em>Nudge Nudge</em> and <em>The Ministry Of Silly Walks</em>, which are frequently compiled out of context — and often heavily edited — on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DVD">DVDs</a> or web video channels than the more obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReferenceOverdosed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReferenceOverdosed">Reference Overdosed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumor">Anti-Humor</a> sketches.
<ul><li> Similarly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCleese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCleese">John Cleese</a> and <em>maybe</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelPalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelPalin">Michael Palin</a> are the only Pythons most people can recognize by face and name. The others' faces will ring a bell if you've watched any of their episodes or films, but only dedicated fans will be able to name them.
</li><li> There are also many (primarily non-British) people who have never seen the TV show <em>or</em> the films and are (passingly) aware of the Python phenomenon as merely a crude pastiche of countercultural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation">Deranged Animation</a> and quirky humor that only nerds could possibly understand. Many assume it's all completely incomprehensible and don't bother to even watch it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>: Despite being extremely popular among geeks most general audiences will likely only recognize Spock and Captain Kirk and be familiar with the phrase "Beam me up, Scotty", not much else. But at least these characters have some fame among people who don't watch the series. Compared to the original <em>Star Trek</em> the follow-up <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> is far less well known and the only character who might be recognized is Captain Picard.
</li><li> Just about everybody in the world knows who the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> are, but the only incarnation everyone can identify is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em>, to the point that if you mention "Power Rangers" to somebody it will probably be the first thing that comes to mind. But with that being said, it's extremely difficult to find non-fans who can name any of the other seasons. And while most people will recognize the color-coded ranger characters, far fewer will be able to know the human identities behind them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em> is an even bigger victim of this than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em>.

Nowadays, it's best known for being the show Cyrus was on before she later became a solo pop star and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy">Overshadowed by Controversy</a> in 2013 for her infamous behavior. To this day, few people can actually name any of its characters besides the title character (including the "normal" persona of the lead character, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">Miley Stewart</a>) or its other five lead actors (with the possible exception of Billy Ray Cyrus; in the context of being the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">Achy Breaky Heart</a>" guy or Miley's dad rather than being on the show), or know anything besides the basic premise, yet they know it exactly for what the show would spawn into.

Amusingly, not only were none of the original cast members (the show actually premiered in the very late '80s), but the first three weren't even the first pop stars who had their careers launched by the program. ("The Party", anyone?) The 1950s original? Good luck finding anyone under the age of 65 who remembers it for anything other than Annette Funicello boob jokes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraman">Ultraman</a></em>: In the west, the eponymous hero is a decently well-known character with a recognizable appearance and a reputation for battling giant monsters and being very popular in Japan.

</li><li> Anything related to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> prior to its revival in 2005. More people know it for scaring kids enough to make them hide behind the sofa despite its cheesy special effects than for its plotlines or most of its characters, and it's rare for a pre-revival Doctor that isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a>'s (the Fourth, who <em>did</em> have the longest tenure) to be referenced. Additionally, there are a number of individual stories that suffer from this. For instance, more people can tell you that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E7TheWarGames">The War Games</a>" introduced the Time Lords in its final episode than can describe the plot of the first nine episodes of the story leading up to it.
<ul><li> <em>Post</em>-revival most people only know specific plots and characters from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a> eras as the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors respectively — Series 2 through 7. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>'s one season as Nine is only remembered in relation to the characters and plot points that carried over into Ten's tenure — partially because it's never rerun. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>'s tenure as Twelve, despite lasting three seasons, is similarly obscure. The show's merchandising still primarily references characters and dialogue from Ten and Eleven's seasons (and <em>sometimes</em> Nine's) while virtually ignoring Twelve's. For instance, the Weeping Angels still stand alongside Daleks and Cybermen as signature villains of the franchise, but their last significant televised appearance was in 2012. Whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodieWhittaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodieWhittaker">Jodie Whittaker</a>'s tenure as Thirteen (the first canon female incarnation of the character) will finally break Ten and Eleven's stranglehold on the franchise remains to be seen.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalMusic">Classical Music</a> generally suffers from this. The composers have become proverbial household names, their famous works are reduced to a few famous pieces that are repurposed as ad-jingles, ringtones, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> and are often known or heard via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdAlEffect">"Weird Al" Effect</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohannSebastianBach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> is widely seen as a high point of classical music, but the most recognized work by him is the opening tunes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToccataAndFugueInDMinor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToccataAndFugueInDMinor">Toccata and Fugue in D minor</a>. Among aficionados, the authorship is still up for debate to be attributed to him on that piece.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> has a huge body of work, but is mostly reduced to the first few notes of "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik", the "Requiem", the "Queen of the Night" chorus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMagicFlute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMagicFlute">The Magic Flute</a></em>, his 40th Symphony, his 25th Symphony, and Rondo Alla Turca. To most people, he is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> in a wig. And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amadeus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amadeus">Amadeus</a></em> hasn't done his reputation much good either. The general public nowadays has the impression he was a cross between a genius and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> with an obnoxious laugh who spoke with a very thick American accent.
</li><li> Most people can recognize the first few notes of "Für Elise" and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OdeToJoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OdeToJoy">Ode to Joy</a> from the Ninth Symphony, but have never heard the rest of the music that follows. Everyone knows Beethoven's grumpy face and knows he was deaf.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntonioVivaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntonioVivaldi">Antonio Vivaldi</a> is best known for <em>The Four Seasons</em>, but usually only the opening movements of <em>Spring</em>. That he wrote other music too is totally unknown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlsoSprachZarathustra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlsoSprachZarathustra">Also sprach Zarathustra</a></em> by Richard Strauss is best known for the "Sunrise" segment, famously used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>, but the rest of the score is totally unknown.
</li><li> Edvard Grieg's score for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/PeerGynt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/PeerGynt">Peer Gynt</a></em> is often reduced to simply the "Morning Mood", "Aase's Death", "Anitra's Dance" and "In the Hall of the Mountain King". That the work has more pieces than that is usually not known, let alone that he composed other stuff too. On the flip side, his music is far more famous and reproduced more often than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikIbsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenrikIbsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>'s masterpiece, so there's that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IgorStravinsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IgorStravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a> is well known as one of the most famous, important, influential and versatile classical composers of the 20th century. Despite that he is just known for snippets from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheFirebird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheFirebird">The Firebird</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRiteOfSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheRiteOfSpring">The Rite of Spring</a></em> and in the case of the latter only for the huge riot that broke out during the premier in 1913. That he also composed less brutal music is mostly unknown, let alone that the majority of his oeuvre was in fact quite accessible neoclassical music.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner">Richard Wagner</a>. You definitely know "Ride of the Valkyries" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DieWalkuere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DieWalkuere">Die Walküre</a></em> and the "Bridal Chorus" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Lohengrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Lohengrin">Lohengrin</a></em> (though probably without the words), and you might know "The Pilgrims' Chorus" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tannhauser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tannhauser">Tannhäuser</a></em> (though it isn't performed in one chunk like that in the opera) or the "Liebestod" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TristanUndIsolde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TristanUndIsolde">Tristan und Isolde</a></em>, but that will be about it. He wrote 113 compositions, including 13 operas (most of which were rather too long, making their Mainstream Obscurity understandable).
<div class="indent"> <em>Wagner has great moments but dull quarter hours</em> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GioachinoRossini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GioachinoRossini">Gioachino Rossini</a>
</div><ul><li> What little most people know of Wagner's music is because it's been used in other places—<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ApocalypseNow">Apocalypse Now</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> cartoon "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc">What's Opera, Doc?</a>" for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RideOfTheValkyries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RideOfTheValkyries">Ride of the Valkyries</a>," and weddings for the "Bridal Chorus". Check out the Classics section of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippet</a> for these and other bits of Wagner that you never knew you knew.
</li><li> "Liebestod" is an example on its own. It is one of the more famous bits of Wagner, a notable finale and dramatic death scene from someone who put a lot into his dramatic deaths. It is a true test of both the musical director and the female lead to be able to do it justice. Now, how does the tune go?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MauriceRavel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MauriceRavel">Maurice Ravel</a>: Known for solely the "Boléro", which is almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">Black Sheep Hit</a>, as the rest of his oeuvre sounds totally different.
</li><li> Camille Saint Saëns: Apart from "Danse Macabre" and "Carnival Of The Animals" it almost seems as if he didn't do anything else in his life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ErikSatie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ErikSatie">Erik Satie</a>: Hailed as one of the great innovators of classical music, yet apart from "Trois Gymnopédies", which can be heard on soundtracks once in a while, his music isn't that well known to the general public.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdwardElgar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdwardElgar">Edward Elgar</a>: In the UK he is known for the "Land Of Hope And Glory" march from "Pomp &amp; Circumstance", which is still played annually to bring up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a> during the Last Night of the Proms and other official UK national manifestations. In the US he is known for the same melody but associated with college graduations and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Macho Men</a>. So it's safe to say that that one section of the entire "Pomp &amp; Circumstance" march is more well known than anything else he ever did.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GustavHolst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GustavHolst">Gustav Holst</a>: "The Planets" is one of the most popular musical works of all time and has been plagiarized so often by other composers, especially on movie soundtracks that depict science fiction or battles that most people probably assume he stole it from them instead of the other way around. It's also his only famous work, more well known than the composer itself.
<ul><li> Within "The Planets" itself, everybody knows how Mars and Jupiter go, and there must presumably be another five, but...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AaronCopland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AaronCopland">Aaron Copland</a> is one of America's most celebrated composers, yet only "Hoedown" and "Fanfare For The Common Man" may ring a bell when played on a CD.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SwanLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SwanLake">Swan Lake</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a>: the first name people think of when it comes to ballet, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14sm98');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14sm98" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14sm98');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">even before <em>Black Swan</em>,</span> but that's often as far as it goes. Music-wise, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnLb43meASw">Overture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CShopT9QUzw">Waltz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIC0nm4nrI8">Cygnets Dance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> get out in the public consciousness somewhat, but that's out of a running time of around two hours. Comparatively few people have seen the entire ballet (even on TV), or are aware of its characters, plot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PyotrIlyichTchaikovsky">or composer</a>.
<ul><li> As for some of Tchaikovsky's other works, you'd likely recognize the swooning string lines from his <em>Romeo and Juliet Fantasy-Overture</em> and the rousing finale of the <em>1812 Overture</em> (a melody which first shows up early in the piece), but those are mere snippets of pieces which both stretch well over fifteen minutes. And many Americans also run the risk of attributing the latter as a piece written about their own War of 1812 and not Napoleon's Russian invasion, despite the liberal use of the French national anthem and Russian folk tunes to symbolize the warring armies.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz">Jazz</a>: Many jazz icons are well known, but when it comes to attributing individual works to them most people are unable to name one. Even in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>'s case, they'll probably name "Hello Dolly" and "What A Wonderful World", which are just songs, not jazz compositions, and Armstrong is well known for his distinctive singing voice and not as a trumpeter which is what his work in Jazz is based on.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MilesDavis">Miles Davis</a> is <em>that guy in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHat">Cool Hat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShades">Cool Shades</a> who faced his audience backward during concerts</em>. Some may be able to name <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KindOfBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KindOfBlue">Kind of Blue</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BitchesBrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BitchesBrew">Bitches Brew</a></em>, but that's about all most people know about this iconic jazz legend.
</li><li> Dizzy Gillespie's face with the bulbous lips when he played the trumpet is more iconic than the number of people who can identify his name, let alone one track by him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GlennMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GlennMiller">Glenn Miller</a>: One of the most famous big band leaders of all time, yet apart from "In the Mood" and "Moonlight Serenade" most people wouldn't recognize much of his work, and if they know about him, it's for his mysterious disappearance.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveVai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveVai">Steve Vai</a> is probably the most well-known example in rock, since he is constantly cited as one of the best guitarists ever, and yet none of his songs or albums are well known by anyone who hasn't specifically looked them up. Not far behind is Joe Satriani, often compared to Vai, whose album <em>Surfing With The Alien</em> is more famous, yet is not known for any particular tracks.
<ul><li> Vai and Satriani <em>are</em> well-known as sidemen and band members, Vai as a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">David Lee Roth's</a> band from 1986-88 and as a one-time member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Whitesnake">Whitesnake</a>, and Satriani as a sideman for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger">Mick Jagger</a> and as a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chickenfoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Chickenfoot">Chickenfoot</a>. Then again, Chickenfoot is probably best known as that supergroup with Joe Satriani in it, so we're right back to where we started.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Swans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Swans">Swans</a> were merely a cult band for a while. But in 2012 when <em>The Seer</em> was released to great acclaim and in 2014 when <em>To Be Kind</em> hit #37 on the album charts, they became shorthand for "that one obscure rock group with Gira and stuff".
</li><li> Many of the most critically hailed rock and pop albums of all time are mostly known either for their cover artwork, their name, or the one hit song on the record:
<ul><li> Most people recognize <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVelvetUndergroundAndNico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheVelvetUndergroundAndNico">The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</a></em> for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyWarhol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyWarhol">Andy Warhol</a> banana cover, but only rock fans can name any of its tracks ("I'm Waiting For The Man" is the only track to get airplay despite not being single). Thanks to covers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a>'s versions of "There She Goes Again" and "Femme Fatale" and Japan's version of "All Tomorrow's Parties", tracks from the album are known by people who were already fans of those bands before they checked out the Velvets.
</li><li> The cover of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeverMindTheBollocksHeresTheSexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeverMindTheBollocksHeresTheSexPistols">Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols</a></em> is <em>the</em> iconic image of punk but any tracks other than "Anarchy in the UK", "God Save the Queen" and "Pretty Vacant" are fairly obscure. "Holidays In The Sun" was single at the time but has not managed to get the airplay the others did, even after their renewed popularity. Outside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> circles, most people who know next to nothing about the genre have all heard of the Sex Pistols and will likely namedrop them if they have to talk about punk music. Yet in many cases, it will be wrong assumptions. For instance: nobody within the Sex Pistols ever wore a punk mohawk or had a safety pin through his nose, yet many people assume they did, because, hey they are punkers right? Johnny Rotten once said, "I don't know why everybody thought we wore leather jackets, we couldn't afford 'em."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OKComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OKComputer">OK Computer</a></em> has been named the best album of the '90s, but, again, few people can name a single track from it except "Karma Police" or "Paranoid Android" (or maybe "No Surprises"). It remains fashionable to list <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KidA">Kid A</a></em> as one of the best albums of the 2000s, yet nobody comments on that many of the tracks.
</li><li> Not just individual albums, but the whole of a band's oeuvre can suffer from this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a> for example. Epically long and prolific career, but known only for (a) the image of Ian Anderson playing the flute standing on one leg, and (b) the opening guitar riff from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AqualungJethroTullAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AqualungJethroTullAlbum">Aqualung</a></em>, and (c) <em>Living in the Past</em> — a song which the band have often said that they are sick and tired of and regret having written, exactly because it's all many people ever think of when thinking of Tull (made worse by the fact that it was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> song that didn't become a hit until several years after it was recorded).
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed example</a> as almost everyone will at least recognize one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardSnippet">Standard Snippets</a> (the opening riffs of "Back in Black", "Highway to Hell" and "Thunderstruck" in particular) when they hear it. <em>Back in Black</em> is the <em>second-highest selling album <strong>of all-time</strong></em> (behind <em>only</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s <em>Thriller</em>), putting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Akka Dakka</a> in contention for the title of "most-successful band ever", but most non-Australians under the age of 25 would only know them from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Megamind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Megamind">Megamind</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardThompson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardThompson">Richard Thompson</a>, with or without Linda, is a world-renowned guitarist and always has several albums on best-of lists, but few people can name any of his songs. He has been called "the best guitarist nobody has heard of".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slayer">Slayer</a>: "The most talked-about band that no one actually listens to." <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReignInBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReignInBlood">Reign in Blood</a></em> is hailed as their best, but how many people outside the metalhead community have ever tried to listen or analyze it?
<ul><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnalCunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnalCunt">Anal Cunt</a> are a band well known for their (jokingly) obscene titles and noisy screaming (ironically more well known than many legitimate grindcore artists), but very few people have bought one of their albums.
</li></ul></li><li> You know the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRiff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRiff">Epic Riff</a> from "Smoke on the Water" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MachineHeadAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MachineHeadAlbum">Machine Head</a></em>? If you know anything at all about music or have ever heard anyone learning the guitar, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">or even just</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBUvyrmEupM">play rhythm games<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, you know that riff. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeepPurple">Deep Purple</a> is surprisingly obscure nowadays for such a prolific and popular band. And the riff itself is lifted from a Gil Evans jazz piece.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a> is known mostly because of how offended the collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> of the 1990s were at his very existence. A lot of people will know his cover of <em>Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)</em> and his song <em>The Beautiful People</em>, but nobody will know that <em>The Beautiful People</em> is from a concept album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar">Antichrist Superstar</a></em>, that there were two more after that, that they tell a continuous story when listened to in reverse from release order, or who the protagonists of those albums are. Even less will know about Manson battling depression and suicidal thoughts for most of his life, his history of self-harm, or his relationship problems.
</li><li> The song "Linus and Lucy" (the unofficial theme for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> animated specials) actually has a jazz section in the middle that most people never noticed (and it is a shock when people learn to play it).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonardCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LeonardCohen">Leonard Cohen</a>'s name comes up frequently as one of the top songwriters of the past 50 years. But ask the average person on the street if they can name even one song he wrote; don't be surprised if the responses are mostly blank stares. There is a good chance your average person would at least <em>recognize</em> "Hallelujah" if played it due to its frequent covers or uses in TV shows and film, though they might not be aware it's by him. The most famous cover version of it — by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffBuckley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffBuckley">Jeff Buckley</a> on his album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Grace">Grace</a></em> — is in itself a cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnCale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnCale">John Cale</a> (ex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground">Velvet Underground</a>)'s own cover arrangement from one of his solo albums, a fact which very few know about, even though Cale's version was featured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a></em> (as done by Rufus Wainwright).

There are few people out there who haven't heard their name before, but the average music fan's knowledge of them is ignorance at its finest. It's not uncommon to hear fans of mainstream metal call them out as noisy trash, meaning that despite being the most famous name in death metal by far, only those <em>who actually like death metal</em> know anything about their actual music rather than just about their controversial cover art.
<ul><li> Their current singer George "Corpsegrinder" Fisher is one of the most famous people in death metal music, if partially due to his huge neck. What most non-fans don't know is that he was not their original singer or songwriter; Chris Barnes was. In fact, Barnes was responsible for the band's most famous and controversial material, so it's entirely possible that the average person associates Corpsegrinder with songs that weren't even his!

That said, he is still mostly ignored, overlooked or misunderstood by the general public, rock fans, and critics. The number of people who actually listened to his work, let alone enjoyed it, is staggeringly low.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork">Björk</a> is well-known to the public for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">being weird</a>, being from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iceland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iceland">Iceland</a>, and her infamous swan dress. That's it. You'd be hard-pressed to find someone who can name one song from her (except <em>maybe</em> "It's Oh So Quiet", which is both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">Black Sheep Hit</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion">Cover Version</a>). In fact, she's only had two songs enter the <em>Hot 100</em>, and both of them fizzled out in the 80 range.
</li><li> The only thing most people know about girl group G.R.L. (aside from <em>maybe</em> their feature on Pitbull's "Wild Wild Love") is that one of its members committed suicide.
</li><li> Rock and roll singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBigBopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBigBopper">The Big Bopper</a> is remembered for exactly two things: his hit "Chantilly Lace" and dying in the same plane crash that killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens">Ritchie Valens</a>.
</li><li> In the early 2010s, Skrillex became somewhat iconic on the internet, particularly in meme culture, as the face of modern EDM (particularly dubstep). However, his mainstream success has always been very scant, and his only major hits came with the Bieber collab "Where Are U Now" and the Suicide Squad song "Purple Lamborghini" Compare that to DJs like David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Zedd, DJ Snake, and The Chainsmokers, whose songs dominated the charts throughout the 2010s, but never received the same type of attention as Skrillex did for his image and persona.
</li><li> On that same note, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deadmau5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Deadmau5">Deadmau5</a>. He's very well-known to the public for his iconic mask, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canadian</a>, and well, being a DJ. Most people, however, can't even name one of his songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nero">Nero</a> is seen as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dubstep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dubstep">dubstep</a>. Not bad, considering that their album never charted on the <em>Billboard</em> 200.
</li><li> Avicii is one of the biggest EDM names in the world, but mainstream audiences will be hard-pressed to name a song of his that isn't "Wake Me Up!", with "Levels" being a <em>possible</em> exception.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WuTangClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WuTangClan">Wu-Tang Clan</a> is a unique kind of band where the general public is more likely to be familiar with their logo and for being influential to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">Hip-Hop</a> than they are with any of their songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kiss">Kiss</a>. They wore weird makeup and costumes and sang "Rock 'N' Roll All Nite" and "Shout It Out Loud." Which means their only albums remembered by anyone (if even that) are <em>Dressed to Kill</em> and <em>Destroyer</em>, respectively. Neither was the band's earliest or even most popular album. People also don't much remember that their career went through a non-makeup phase between 1983 and 1996, during which they had at least a handful of radio hits. Amusingly, their 1980 concept album <em>Music From the Elder</em> is so obscure that the band members themselves can't remember how to play it!
<ul><li> KISS is so affected by this that most of what people think they know about the band is actually false. Gene Simmons is often thought to be the frontman. That was actually Paul Stanley, though Simmons did have a memorable persona and took lead vocals often. Few people remember that they made a film (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KissMeetsThePhantomOfThePark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KissMeetsThePhantomOfThePark">KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park</a></em>) or that there were more members than just Stanley, Simmons, Ace Frehley, and Peter Criss. Some believe that they were, or at least pretended to be, Satan worshipers, a rumor starting that their name was even an acronym for "Knights in Satan's Service" (the band members have routinely said the name isn't an acronym for anything). Finally, KISS is often thought of as a "heavy metal" band, when in fact their music could be, at best, considered "hard rock", and often included soft, gentle songs like "Beth" or "Forever".
</li></ul></li><li> Derek Taylor is a deceptively influential figure among guitarists whose approach to tapping and legato (accomplished through what he refers to as the "Spock technique") has been copied by many, many players over the years. However, most guitarists using his techniques would be hard-pressed to name anything that he released even though they're familiar with his approach.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HollywoodUndead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HollywoodUndead">Hollywood Undead</a> is very well-known for their creepy masks, the fact that they combine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapRock">rap with rock</a>, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/MySpace">MySpace</a> band, and for making party tracks. But not too many people can actually name any of their songs, nor will they know about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">serious tracks in their later albums</a> that go hand-in-hand with the party tracks. The fact is, they haven't had any hit on any format, but are still well known for their appearances.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EaglesOfDeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EaglesOfDeathMetal">Eagles of Death Metal</a> are best known in the mainstream for being the band playing at the Bataclan Theatre in Paris on at the time of the November 13, 2015, terrorist attacks, or for being a backing band on some songs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kesha">Kesha</a>'s album <em>Rainbow</em>. Far fewer people will be familiar with their music.
</li><li> Great White — best known for being the band playing from the dead Rhode Island nightclub fire.
</li><li> Despite being a highly prolific producer, British musician Mark Ronson is known outside his home country for one thing: being the actual lead artist on the 2015 megahit "Uptown Funk!", which is almost universally associated first and foremost with its far more well-known guest star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrunoMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrunoMars">Bruno Mars</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DestinysChild">Destiny's Child</a> was massive back in their late-'90s to early-'00s prime, but nowadays they are known solely for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Beyonce">Beyoncé</a>'s former band. Even people who do remember their music won't be able to name its other members (even Kelly Rowland, who had a successful career of her own.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ConwayTwitty">Conway Twitty</a> was one of the most enduring figures in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, with a huge catalog of 40 #1 hits (second only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeStrait">George Strait</a>). But could anyone in the modern-day say anything about him other than "that guy that they kept doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gags</a> to on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>" or possibly "that guy with the really deep voice who sang '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercourseWithYou">I'd Love to Lay You Down</a>'"?
</li><li> Nitty Gritty Dirt Band is one of the longest-lasting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> bands, having performed without interruption since 1966, with multiple albums and awards to their name. But could your average person name any song of theirs besides "Fishin' in the Dark" (except maybe "Mr. Bojangles" or "An American Dream", both of which were big pop hits that predated their full-on transition to a country band), or even name one of the band's many members? Some people may not even know anything about them except that time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> mangled their name and the lyrics to "Stand a Little Rain" at an awards ceremony (as referenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WillieNelson">Willie Nelson</a> is an American cultural icon widely known for his hippie appearance, distinctive vocals, and predilection for marijuana. However, the only songs of his most people can name (assuming they can name any) are "Always on My Mind", a polished pop ballad that's something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">Black Sheep Hit</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong">Signature Song</a> "On the Road Again." Almost no one outside of hardcore country fans has heard the landmark '70s albums like <em>Phases and Stages</em>, <em>Shotgun Willie</em>, and <em>Red Headed Stranger</em> that made him an outlaw legend.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloRida" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FloRida">Flo Rida</a> is a rapper mostly known for his top 40 hit songs about partying in clubs like "Right Round", "Low", and "Club Can't Handle Me" but you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who's actually listened to an entire album from beginning to end or someone who can name any songs besides his hits. The same deal can be said for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pitbull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pitbull">Pitbull</a>, really.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Motorhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Motorhead">Motörhead</a> is very well-known across the world, even to non-metal listeners, for its frontman Lemmy, who had a well-documented appearance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">lifestyle</a>, having themes about sex, drugs, and gambling, their song called "Ace of Spades", being influential to the metal in general, and Lemmy ultimately dying at 70. That being said, considerably fewer people have actually listened to their music or can name any other song of theirs besides "Spades" or their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> entrance themes, even if they know about the band. As an example of this, the band is often thought of as being "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Lemmy + 2</a>", as if the other two were throwaways. While it was true that he was the only original member, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerLineup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunnerLineup">the final lineup was stable for over twenty years</a>.
</li><li> Ask anyone in the anime circuit who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Vocaloid">Hatsune Miku</a> is and they'll be able to recognize her and her design in a heartbeat. They may even know some of the more popular songs from the circuit or some of the other non-Miku Vocaloid characters, especially thanks to the influence of things like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HatsuneMikuProjectDIVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HatsuneMikuProjectDIVA">Project DIVA</a></em> series. Now ask them to name the people who actually <em>made</em> the songs. Chances are, they'll at most know the song by the Vocaloid providing the vocals (e.g. "a Miku song"), and only people within the fanbase or devoted fans of specific musicians will know who were the actual people responsible for composing them. (In fact, there are many cases of more casual listeners who listen to the music and are active fans of the characters but don't bother to look into it.) This extends so far that many people outside the active fanbase (including active <em>DIVA</em> players who don't have exposure outside the game) aren't aware that the vast majority of Vocaloid music isn't commissioned by a company and is mainly just indie music by individual people that happened to get popular on the Internet.
<ul><li> Speaking of Vocaloid, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilliousChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/EvilliousChronicles">Evillious Chronicles</a></em> is well-known for the "Story of Evil" arc, beginning with the song "Daughter of Evil," and maybe you'll know that that arc was part of a "Seven Deadly Sins" series... but far fewer people know that the roles the Vocaloids play in these songs became established characters and it was actually the first "Vocaloid-based original canon" that led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">others</a> like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackRockShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlackRockShooter">Black★Rock Shooter</a>,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShuuenNoShioriProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShuuenNoShioriProject">Shuuen No Shiori Project</a>,</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KagerouDaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KagerouDaze">Kagerou Daze</a>.</em> In fact, "Story of Evil" is a very minor part of a sprawling canon, though merchandise, adaptations, and eventually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> noticed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">it was much more well-known than the rest</a> and gave Riliane (who? Oh, right, "Daughter of Evil Rin") and her story arc a big shot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">Wolverine Publicity</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">Germans Love David Hasselhoff</a> is known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein">Rammstein</a> is popular in America" in the German version of this wiki. The band has sparked multiple controversies in its home country that brought it into the mainstream despite most people only know a few songs. So when an American metalhead brings up Rammstein to a German, they're either talking to a metalhead who thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks">It's Popular, Now It Sucks!</a>, or a non-metalhead who doesn't get why people keep asking about this mainstream band in particular.
</li><li> While pretty much everyone on the planet knows who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">Eminem</a> is and what he looks like, as well as being able to name one of his hit songs, few people who aren't into rap music have actually taken the time to listen to a full album from him. Whenever you encounter people discussing his lyrics or rapping ability in-depth, it's almost always amongst people in the hip-hop fandom; if someone knows him for any reason other than his music, it's likely for being everywhere in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the controversy his lyrical content stirred up.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>. One of the most celebrated artists of the twentieth century, virtually everyone knows who Ol' Blue Eyes is, what his voice was like, the fact that he was a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RatPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RatPack">Rat Pack</a>, etc., but comparatively far, far fewer people have actually listened to an album or could name a song of his that isn't "My Way" and maybe one or two others.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup">Bowling for Soup</a> is a decently recognizable band thanks to their part in the early to mid '2000s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopPunk">Pop Punk</a> scene and their involvement in various children's media from that decade like performing the themes to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyNeutronBoyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyNeutronBoyGenius">Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>. Despite this, very few people have actually listened to anything from them besides "1985", or possibly "High School Never Ends" and "Girl All The Bad Guys Want"; none of their albums were even certified.

Since pro wrestling has taken a sharp decline in mainstream popularity since the late 90s/early 2000s, there are many wrestling legends who are so well-known that even non-fans will likely have heard of them (i.e. Hulk Hogan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">André the Giant</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a>) but far fewer people will have actually watched them wrestle a match. And The Rock is better known as "Dwayne Johnson: Hollywood Star" to general audiences rather than as The People's Champion, even though his wrestling career is why he's famous in the first place.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Christianity</a>:
<ul><li> A lot of quotes are attributed to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em> that are actually by others. Many people think certain sayings, such as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">The Lord helps those who help themselves</a>," "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Love the sinner, hate the sin</a>," or "Cleanliness is next to Godliness" are Biblical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">when they really aren't</a>.
</li><li> Most people could probably summarise pretty well the first two books of the Bible — in other words, from Creation to Moses coming down from Mount Sinai with the Ten Commandments. What happens for the rest of the Old Testament, when exactly does Christianity cut off from Judaism... that part is much less well known.
</li><li> And about that Creation story: most people don't tend to know off the top of their head that there are two accounts of creation, and most English-speaking Christians don't know that Noah's "two animals of each kind" were <a class="urllink" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%207&amp;version=NRSVCE">actually fourteen in one (canonical) verse<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19698u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19698u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19698u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though that fourteen was only for the birds and the "clean" animals; the unclean had to make do with only two.</span>
</li><li> Stuff like the Ten Commandments, and other parts of the Book, as well as the Christ-Narrative, told in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels">The Four Gospels</a></em> and which parable and episode come from which is a little obscure. Then there's the issue of translations since the most widely known version of the Bible in the English-speaking world is the King James Bible, which modern Biblical scholars consider inexact as a translation, albeit accomplished as a work of literature and important for the influence on the English language.
</li></ul></li><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Judaism</a>, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalmud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalmud">the Talmud</a>, a text that everyone is aware of but almost no one has actually read. Then again, just because this particular collection of jurisprudence is concerned with religious rather than secular law doesn't make it <em>not</em> a bunch of legal briefs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>:
<ul><li> In a lot of countries, especially nations like India, and even parts of the West, it's quite a surprise that Islam <em>is</em> an Abrahamic religion and that Muslims consider Jesus, or Isa, one of their prophets. This is because, on account of colonialism, Islam is considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orientalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Orientalism">an Eastern religion</a>, within Asia and Europe, while Christianity, and to a lesser extent Judaism, is considered a Western religion, and the origin of Islam tends to blur those distinctions.
</li><li> It's common to assume that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a> is to Muslims what the Bible is to Christians or believe that Islam is similar to Christianity in practice and institutions. In actual practice, Islam in multiple societies tends to be far looser in doctrine and practice, having little in the way of organization and centralization common even in Protestant sects. As such there are not many Muslim adherents who have read their Holy Book all the way through.
</li><li> In the case of the Quran, one must make a distinction between reading the Quran and <em>understanding</em> the Quran. You see, the Quran is conventionally read in Arabic, even in Muslim-majority countries where Arabic is not the local tongue. In Afghanistan in particular, this issue is compounded by the problem of widespread illiteracy. In rural Afghanistan, you can expect to find that the mullahs — that is, the people who are supposed to be interpreting the Quran for the local people — are illiterate themselves. For those who are curious, the three largest Muslim-majority nations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pakistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/India">India</a>, are not Arabic nor do they have Arabic speaking Muslims.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Hinduism">Hinduism</a> is one of the world's largest practicing religions, and the only classical polytheistic religion still being practiced uninterruptedly (as opposed to Graeco-Roman and Norse paganism), having adherents that are more than a billion worldwide. Yet most in the West know very little about the religion, or its famous epics, and the few times Indian religion is represented in Western media, it's either in the context of British colonialist fiction (which is swallowed uncritically by Western Anglophilia) or something like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheTempleOfDoom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></em> which is entirely inaccurate from beginning to end, or it's conflated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> which has far less in common with it than say, Christianity has with Judaism.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">Cricket</a> is a major sport in the Commonwealth, with its World Cup being the third-largest sporting event after the FIFA World Cup and the Summer Olympics. In America, it is usually seen as a very slow game or seen as a quaint British pastime and colonial white-man game.
<ul><li> This is a major surprise to actual cricket fans since, in international cricket, the English team is widely considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperTiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperTiger">Paper Tiger</a> that tend not to do well in major tournaments (having never won the World Cup)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note203cyi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note203cyi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note203cyi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Leading to snarky jokes about the English not being as good as they should be in the major sports they invented, such as soccer, tennis, and cricket</span>. Likewise, some of the most famous teams in cricket history are the West Indies (an all-black team that won major titles in Test and ODI titles and set most of the records, and won the first two international world cups), while the International Cricketing authority inaugurated the first sporting boycott on apartheid, South Africa, in 1968-69 over their refusal to allow England's Basil D'Oliveira to play on tour. While in modern times, the biggest cricketing nations, and the line's share of viewership, comes from the Indian Subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Sri-Lanka), where cricket is played by street-kids across all villages and cities, and in numerical terms, is played by more people, and more non-white people, than baseball and basketball.
</li><li> Part of the reason is that while cricket <em>is</em> a major international sport it is only played by a small number of nations (for a long time it was 9, but then became 12), the fact that these nations include England, South Africa, Australia, the West Indies, and the very large population center that is the Indian Subcontinent allow it to punch far above its weight in terms of viewership and coverage, but with the exception of Australia and England, most cricket-playing nations aren't developed nations so they tend to be under-reported in global sports coverage, and the few cricketers that are known in the Anglophone, are from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorProvincialism">Australia and England</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Golf is a proverbial sport for rich people, politicians, and those with time on their hands. The Golf club <em>is</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicItem">Iconic Item</a> (often used in movies as a weapon), and the most famous golfer is Tiger Woods but most people can't tell you the nuts-and-bolts aside from the fact that getting a hole-in-one is a big deal since it's not as visually dynamic as other games (even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a></em> usually has opponents facing one another across a playing field).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Association Football</a>, or Soccer as Americans call it, is the biggest game in the world, played by more countries and more people than anywhere in the world, and bigger than the Olympics, and yet from watching say American movies and TV Shows (which tend to be the biggest media on the planet), you often find little references to major players and events from the Football world. In America, the game is known if at all for the corruption scandal of FIFA and its president Sepp Blatter, and for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnitedPassions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnitedPassions">United Passions</a></em> film that became a proverbial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxOfficeBomb">Box Office Bomb</a>.

Thanks to advertising, commercials, billboards, their brands are "known" to the general public who know they are games and you can play them, but they aren't actually widely played. The developer Patrice Desilets noted that as commercially successful as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> was, it pales when compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCameron">James Cameron</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em> in terms of audience reach.
<ul><li> Among the general public, if you ask people to name video games, or think about what they think of when they play games, they will usually think of arcade games of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tetris">Tetris</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros1">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>.

</li><li> Unlike other media, like movies, books, TV, and music, video games can only be experienced provided people shell out additional money to have access to consoles, or in the case of PC, the appropriate graphical requirements (and of course some titles are console exclusives and so on, further straining accessibility). Mobile gaming, which exploded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, is the first real common platform, and it has a bigger active gaming audience on a sheer numerical headcount than console than AAA console titles with titles such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TempleRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TempleRun">Temple Run</a></em> being played by more people than say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em> (both of which can be said to be in the same genre) but getting less critical commentary than both.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasons">Story of Seasons</a></em> fans are quick to cite <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HarvestMoon64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HarvestMoon64">Harvest Moon 64</a></em> as the best game in the franchise, and as one of the better games on the Nintendo 64, but few fans have actually played it. Most fans began around <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature">Friends of Mineral Town</a></em> or later. It took a long time for the game to be released on Virtual Console and it is an expensive Nintendo 64 title, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">Keep Circulating the Tapes</a> was a problem for fans who wanted to play it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ZeroWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ZeroWing">Zero Wing</a></em> entered the mainstream because of its hilariously bad translation of the intro...but very few people know anything about the actual gameplay, or have ever played the game itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanzerDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanzerDragoon">Panzer Dragoon</a></em> at least was this. It was visible on many top 100 games lists and is considered to be the best game on the Sega Saturn, but many have not played it. It helps that only 10,000 copies were printed in the US, making it a hard find even then (although to be fair it fared better in Europe and Japan).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> has a large fanbase, but to the general public it's only known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicCharacterForgottenTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconicCharacterForgottenTitle">Phoenix Wright</a> and the <em><strong>Objection!</strong></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meme">meme</a>. Good luck finding someone who isn't a fan that can name any character besides Phoenix Wright, or knows anything about the gameplay.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> is one of the few franchises known to the public and Lara Croft is a gaming icon with as much visibility and recognition as say Mario and Sonic, becoming an embodiment of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">Male Gaze</a> and a symptom of the adolescent tendencies of the gaming public. Yet relatively few have played the original Tomb Raider games that are known among gaming aficionados for their platforming and tricky puzzles as much as its polygon count, and the more critically regarded reboots (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013">Tomb Raider (2013)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTombRaider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a></em>) which dial down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">Male Gaze</a> are likewise little played or less well known than Croft herself. Among non-gamers, Lara Croft <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, and a good portion of the movie audience probably didn't even know her origins in gaming.
</li><li> Platform-exclusives get this big time:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar">God of War</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Uncharted">Uncharted</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> and other Sony exclusive games are widely known in gaming circles but are only played by those who have access to the Playstation consoles, or those few who can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">afford multiple consoles to play multiple games</a>. The same applies to games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WiiSports">Wii Sports</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo">Halo</a></em> and other Nintendo and Xbox exclusives.
</li><li> Even Nintendo's flagship titles are not immune to this. The most widely known and celebrated <em>Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em> titles tend to be older, such as the 2D <em>Mario Bros</em>' and as for <em>Zelda</em>, it's still <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em> which was <em>the</em> 3D Game. The reason is that each console generation gets more competitive than the last, and makes each new title more and more exclusive on account of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConsoleWars">Console Wars</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em> is considered a landmark first-person shooter released on the Nintendo 64 console and often shows up on the best-of lists. Yet most people who play FPS games are more familiar with other landmarks like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> than that game. Not helping is that while <em>Doom</em> and <em>Half-Life</em> are still very accessible via digital distribution platforms, the only legal way to play the original <em>GoldenEye 007</em> today is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">buy an N64 and a copy of the game second-hand.</a> (A remaster of the game <em>was</em> planned at one point, but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewedByTheLawyers">Screwed by the Lawyers</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> is famous for its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">insanely detailed graphics</a>, equally infamous for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">insanely expensive PCs needed to run them</a>, and that's about it. Conversations about <em>Crysis</em> that don't involve its graphics are rare, and <em>Crysis</em> is the go-to example to use for the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">PC Master Race</a>" in a forum argument. It's been described as "the only game that gets talked about more than it gets played".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SystemShock">System Shock</a></em> series is considered one of the best horror-themed shooters to be released on the PC. However, almost nobody has ever played the series prior to its rerelease on Steam and GOG in 2013. There are many reasons to why the series didn't achieve mainstream success from its PC-exclusivity to it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">lack of physical copies</a> since 2001.

While it sold an at-the-time respectable 300,000 copies in the US, its commercial success and mainstream recognition (read: recognition among casual gamers) aren't anywhere near its popularity with hardcore gamers and old-school JRPG fans.
</li><li> The entire fighting game community knows <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em> as the grandfather of fighting games, but it is relatively untouched by the younger generation.

Perhaps because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsHardSoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsHardSoItSucks">the sheer intimidation factor</a>, comparatively few are willing to actually <em>play</em> the games and get familiar with each game's specific quirks and gimmicks.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> also has the added honor of its characters and music being mainstream while the games themselves remain in obscurity, at least outside Japan. With the sheer amount of fan content (fanart, remixes, fanime, etc) it's almost impossible not to have encountered it at least once, knowingly or not. Those who do realize that the fanart and remixes are derivative works <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomEnragingMisconception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomEnragingMisconception">tend to assume that it's from an anime.</a> Even amongst those who count themselves as fans, it's not uncommon for someone to have never actually played the games.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>. Most people remember that there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">a video game back in 2002</a> that involved a bunch of spiky-haired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> characters palling around with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy">Goofy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a>, and a decent number of people remember <em>playing</em> that game. Considerably fewer people could actually tell you anything about the plot of the series past the first game, or name any of its many original characters (Sora, Riku, Kairi, Ansem, Xehanort, etc.).

Despite this, video game fans and websites almost never discuss these games. If they do, it's usually either to complain about casual games or to talk about some kid who spent their parents' cash on a free-to-play game. It doesn't help that few casual series have dedicated fandoms.

To the mainstream, <em>Yo-Kai Watch</em> never evolved past <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">the original series</a>, despite the fact <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatchShadowside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatchShadowside">Yo-kai Watch: Shadowside</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch4">Yo-kai Watch 4</a></em> revamped the cast and gave the character's new designs.
</li><li> While the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series was never really mainstream to begin with, the inclusion of Joker from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros.

<ul><li> Meanwhile, Persona's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">parent series</a> is often only known among Persona fans as... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">Persona's parent series.</a> For those that do know about SMT, they generally only know about its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralitySystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralitySystem">Morality System</a>, that most games in the series are set <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHisSled">that the Abrahamic God features as the Final Boss of multiple installments,</a> or just that it's generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> and quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">"edgy."</a> As far as actually playing it is concerned, it's very niche.

Thanks to various buyouts and rebrandings, they've continued to make new games to varying degrees of frequency, but didn't enjoy as much recognition worldwide to the point that their mascot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Terry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">Bogard</a>'s inclusion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros.

</li><li> The first two games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series qualify. The fan base now primarily consists of people who only know this series from the third game onward.

</li><li> With the disappearance of nearly all western animation from North American television that's older than the late 90s or early 00s, a great many classics, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts">Classic Disney Shorts</a></em>, have fallen into this. The former two still air on channels dedicated to legacy programming like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Boomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Boomerang">Boomerang</a>, but they still fall into this because: A) Boomerang is on a high cable package that many households wouldn't have (especially with the declining number of households that have cable service at all), and B) the airing times are inconsistent and usually during hours when children are either asleep or in school. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24vhyy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24vhyy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24vhyy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They used to air on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> off and on until 2017 but, after 2004 (before then, they aired in primetime too), they aired almost <em>exclusively</em> when kids are at school with no weekend slots aside from <em>Looney Tunes</em> from 2011-2014 where it aired at 6 AM, a time slot where most children are still asleep. By 2015, they had incredibly inconsistent timeslots with <em>Looney Tunes</em> or <em>Tom and Jerry</em> airing any giving week only to be gone by the next.</span> This makes it harder for modern children to familiarize themselves by watching them on TV. And with them hidden so deep away on streaming services that you need to actively hunt for them to find them, few kids today will have watched them directly, only seeing them on merchandise, reboots, or as references by newer media.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi">Bambi</a></em> gets this for similar reasons to <em>Old Yeller</em>. Everyone remembers the first half of the movie or at least the iconic scene where Bambi's mother is killed and he leaves the forest with his father. What many people don't remember is the second half, in which Bambi returns to the forest as an adult and has to save the animals from a human-caused wildfire. If anything else comes to mind, Thumper reciting, "If ya can't say nuttin' nice...don't say nuttin' at all" is what most remember.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BettyBoop">Betty Boop</a></em> is more known today for appearing on merchandise than for appearing in short films. Ask anyone what Betty ever did in her cartoons, besides saying "boop-boop-be-doop" and getting stalked by horny old geezers, and you'll get a blank stare.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CasperTheFriendlyGhost">Casper the Friendly Ghost</a></em> is a friendly ghost who doesn't want to scare others... and that's about it. Ditto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich">Richie Rich</a> who is known... for being rich.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em>: Adjusted for inflation, it's the fourth highest-grossing animated film ever, widely praised as a masterpiece of cinema and art, but not many people today can actually name a segment from it aside from "the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> part", "the one with the mushrooms", "the dancing hippos" and maybe "that scene with the devil guy". Additionally, its unique nature makes it pretty much the least known of the five Golden Age Disney films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelixTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelixTheCat">Felix the Cat</a></em>: One of the oldest, most iconic and enduring cartoon characters of all time. Yet, how many people under 30 have ever seen one of his cartoons of the silent era? Apart from that: how many people could actually tell you anything about Felix's personality? The reason the series even remains known is simply by the power of inertia since the series is so firmly rooted in the public consciousness and animation culture.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Popeye">Popeye the Sailor</a></em>: People know that Popeye is strong, eats spinach, has a girlfriend named Olive Oyl and an archenemy named Bluto. They may also know that he has a friend named Wimpy who loves hamburgers and an adopted son named Swee'pea. They may not know that he starred in both a comic strip as well as over 200 short cartoons from the 1930s to the 1950s, much less be able to name any of them or tell you what happens in them outside of "he gets into fights".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SteamboatWillie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SteamboatWillie">Steamboat Willie</a></em>: Most people know this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a>'s first sound cartoon and the film that launched the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> empire. The opening scene with Mickey whistling and steering the boat has since become the ident for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> Feature Animation early in the 21st century, but how many are familiar with the rest of the plot?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker">Woody Woodpecker</a></em>: Everyone recognizes the character and can mimic his iconic laugh, but actually being able to name any of the side characters or stories is less easy. Many kids today seem to know him more from his association with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/UniversalStudios">Universal Studios</a> theme parks than from having watched his short films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">Yogi Bear</a></em>: He is a bear who is smarter than the average bears, has a friend named Boo Boo and steals <em>pick-a-nick</em> baskets. That's about all the general public of today knows about these cartoons, and they know even less (if anything) about his fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> TV stars of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a> onward such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HuckleberryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HuckleberryHound">Huckleberry Hound</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuickDrawMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/QuickDrawMcGraw">Quick Draw McGraw</a></em>, etc.

</li><li> The number of people who've actually watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> for its plot likely pales in comparison to the number of people who know about the show due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfMemes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfMemes">Fountain of Memes</a> status, courtesy of its bizarre animation, zany quotes, and surprisingly catchy songs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrMagoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrMagoo">Mr. Magoo</a></em> is referenced in fiction a lot as the butt of practically every blind joke.

</li><li> Almost every single journal article about autism references Leo Kanner's original description of autism. Many of them go on to summarize his paper with comments that make it obvious that they haven't read it, such as claiming that he described low functioning autism (in reality, his subjects showed a wide range of ability, with one being clearly high functioning). Hans Asperger's article gets this a bit too since no one seems to notice that modern criteria for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergerSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AspergerSyndrome">Asperger Syndrome</a> are noticeably different from his conception of the condition.
</li><li> Unless you're talking to an actual Constitutional Law scholar, odds are that most people who talk about the Constitution and what different Amendments mean in different contexts have not actually read the entire document or can tell you what all the different Amendments are. This is also true for many European constitutions; you'd be lucky to find an average person on a German street who knows at least 3 articles on the <em>Grundgesetz</em> (the first and most important of them being "Human dignity is untouchable.")
</li><li> Among language-learning circles, this trope tends to go for languages without a large speaker pool but that are tied to an oppressed or otherwise romanticized population. On language-learning websites, many users have languages like Basque, Irish, Ainu, Catalan, Icelandic, and Navajo in their "wanted" lists, or claim a low degree of proficiency, but never get any further because it's so difficult to find materials and, well, they don't really care that much. <br/>Navajo has less to do with the Navajo being romanticizedthey're not, they essentially have no real presence to the rest of the world's consciousness<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25ezmt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25ezmt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25ezmt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_talker#Navajo_code_talkers">aside from being a super-complex Allied code in<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a></span>and more to do with Navajo being a sampler of "weird" linguistic features.

It's also a tonal language with some extremely unusual consonantsthe same ones as Tlingit, whose sounds were borrowed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConLang">Klingon</a> precisely because they don't show up in most human languages. <em>And</em> there are about two textbooks, which you either have to order online or buy <em>on</em> the Navajo Rez, or in a few places nearby.</span>
</li><li> There are many celebrities out there who often appear in tabloids, media, and TV shows, and whose faces and names will be recognized by many, despite most people not being able to actually explain <em>why</em> they are exactly famous. Socialites like Zsa Zsa Gabor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">Paris Hilton</a> and people who became well known due to just <em>appearing</em> a lot in the media without actually doing something for it are a good example. But the phenomenon can also be observed with other celebrities. Often people will recognize somebody and want an autograph or take a picture with him, despite the fact that they don't really know <em>who</em> this person is or <em>what</em> he is famous for. They just know him from <em>somewhere</em>. In some cases, they even confuse them with other celebrities.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SalvadorDali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SalvadorDali">Salvador Dalí</a> once told a reporter that he didn't really feel like "the most famous painter in the world", because most people who encountered him did recognize him, but weren't sure "whether he was a singer, a film star, a madman or an author."
</li><li> Similarly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PabloPicasso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PabloPicasso">Pablo Picasso</a> is universally recognized as a quintessential visual artist, his name used as a byword to describe someone's artistic talents (<em>Why you're a regular Picasso!</em>). Yet, hardly any ordinary person would be able to name or specifically recognize a single painting by him.
</li><li> Frida Kahlo is a known face in the feminist movement and hailed as an example of an early feminist artist, but pretty much all the people who praise her and reference her have no idea of what her works were, they seem to only recognize her face... but most of her works were self-portraits anyway. Most notably is her image being used as an example of feminism when her most famous work is her journal rather than her paintings and said journal is stuffed with declarations of her love towards the painter Diego Rivera and all the drama that ensued from it, and it reads more like the diary of a lovestruck teenager. Think about it. The most famous work of a feminist painter is the diary filled with her destructive relationship with a cheating man. But wait, there's more—Frida Kahlo is hailed as a feminist icon because she used to cheat on Diego Rivera and she would also get drunk and smoke, therefore all her feminist cred is based on her habits and none on her work.
</li><li> If you follow the news regularly, there are many people whom you might recognize as "a politician", but if they're not the head of state, it can often be tough to recall precisely who they are and what their official function is. For example, the only member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>'s second-term cabinet that most people can name is John Kerry, and even then, most people only knew about him beforehand because he ran against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> in the 2004 presidential election.

Many forget that she was famous from the very beginning of her career, and <em>not</em> for showing up in the tabloids for no reason. She was Miss May for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Playboy">Playboy</a></em> in 1992 and Playmate of the Year after that, and then became a model for Guess Jeans - despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuesqueStunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuesqueStunner">nearly 6 feet tall</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">weighing 150 pounds</a> (making her the single tallest and heaviest Playmate in the magazine's 60+ -year history), and thus totally anathema to the "waif" models so popular in the 1990s. These were noteworthy accomplishments, relatively small though they were. But then her (much older) husband died, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByControversy">the court battle for his estate overshadowed everything else</a>... and <em>then</em> came the grotesque weight gain and the reality show...

But ask a random person on the street to name even one machine, and chances are they cannot. Sometimes, you'll get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em>. On rare occasions, you'll get <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/JurassicParkDataEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/JurassicParkDataEast">Jurassic Park (Data East)</a></em>. If anyone can name anything past that, then they're either 1) a pinball fan, 2) a trivia person, 3) saw a machine when younger and remembered it fondly, or 4) stumbled across a machine by accident and remembered its name. Because of the near extinction of arcades, pinball is notoriously difficult to find—even veterans who have been playing pinball for decades have trouble knowing where to find them—and so most people are unaware that pinball machines are still being designed and manufactured today, and by at least five companies.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28imtc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note28imtc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28imtc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Stern">Stern</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerseyJackPinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerseyJackPinball">Jersey Jack Pinball</a>, Heighway, Spooky Pinball, and Dutch Pinball, with several startups with their first games in development.</span>

While these characters may show up in mainstream every once in a while, expect them to not have any information beyond being "anime" characters, even when the closest thing to "anime" some might have gone as far as a promo video or cutscene.
