</p><p>Probably one of Hollywood's biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a>, the Former Child Star is a star of TV or film whose career was at its peak in their formative years. Alas, such an unorthodox childhood can leave its mark on anyone (especially if they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">Not Allowed to Grow Up</a>), and it always does in fictional depictions of the Former Child Star. In adulthood, they may be a struggling actor who finds it hard to be taken seriously when everyone remembers them as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">that one kid from that one show</a>," if they're remembered at all.
</p><p>It doesn't help that puberty is a fickle beast and there is no guarantee that a cute and adorable kid will have Hollywood looks as an adult. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson">Emma Watson</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielRadcliffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielRadcliffe">Daniel Radcliffe</a> may have matured nicely since their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> days, but there are countless others whose adolescent years weren't nearly as kind, making it that much harder to find acting work as adults.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>As for those who left showbiz, many wind up mourning their glory days in a dead-end job, caught up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexDrugsAndRockAndRoll">Sex, Drugs and Rock &amp; Roll</a>, or (dis)gracing the covers of tabloids after a run-in with the law. Sadly, a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as the troubled biographies of some real-life Former Child Stars will show.
</p><p>It should be noted that the worst examples of this trope in real life come from kids whose home lives were unstable to begin with: abusive, exploitative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">stage parents</a> and/or a family history of addiction will make a child actor particularly vulnerable to the excesses of Hollywood. There are others who grew into relatively-normal adults, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodieFoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JodieFoster">Jodie Foster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostInSpace">Bill Mumy</a>, because their parents took care to give them a stable upbringing under the circumstances.
</p><p>No doubt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingUpSucks">Growing Up Sucks</a> for them... especially if they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualPurity">treated as though they never did</a>.

</p><p>This trope applies not only to theatre and motion picture, but also to several sports, such as gymnastics, and arts, such as ballet, where the athletes rise to the top very young and the career is likely to be short.

One of them is an ex-convict who apparently did time for taking the fall for Krusty.

</li><li> One of the recurring themes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> is that this ends up happening to <em>all</em> "Boy Adventurers" when they grow up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest">Jonny Quest</a> himself, for example, is now a paranoid junkie.

<ul><li> This happened to Sarah Lynn, the actress who played the youngest daughter on the title character's old show <em>Horsin' Around</em> (a <em>Full House</em> clone in its own right).

</li><li> Goober, the annoying house guest in <em>Horsin' Around</em> didn't turn out too well in adulthood either. The actor who played him (as BoJack so helpfully pointed out to Todd in one episode) ended up molesting some Laker Girls, and in the third season, it's revealed that he's become a sleazy nightclub owner and a drug dealer. Ironically, he's voiced by Fred Savage, a former child star who's had a well-adjusted adulthood despite not being as popular as he was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWonderYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWonderYears">The Wonder Years</a></em>.

He enjoyed the job but left the show when they threatened to phase him out in favor of a hip new kid character named Cousin Lorenzo, and set out to find a <em>real</em> family. The reason no one seems to recognize him is that the episodes produced after Grizzly was introduced were stricken from the airwaves. Being a former child star would probably explain a few things about Grizz, like his tendency to be a people-pleaser and occasional desperation to impress people and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">make new friends</a>.

When Scooby and the rest of the gang meet them, Andy and Mandy are content to not be involved in the business anymore and would rather focus on things like tennis and prom dresses (respectively); the pair do, however, remember Flash fondly and visit his grave from time to time. While there is some trouble in their life during the episode, it's because their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">mother Susan</a> would love nothing more than to see them make a comeback, while they just want to live normal lives.

The winner of this match would be awarded the use of the Deathmatch time machine to rewind the clock and extend their careers a while. Muniz won, but the machine malfunctioned, transforming him into an old man. Ironically, both Muniz and Iler would both grow up to be aversions.
<ul><li> Infamous straight example Macaulay Culkin had a grudge match against Hailey Joel Osment specifically because Osment had seemingly avoided his fate. An especially unfair match since Osment was <em>12</em> when this match took place, while Culkin was 20.

Though her musical career has rebounded (though not quite up to its former heights), her personal life around the mid-late '00s was such a trainwreck and her reputation in utter tatters, that she was eventually placed under the conservatorship of her father. She got therapy and pulled her life around and is a loving and supportive mom to her sons, such as indulging in their interests (like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>) or when they were younger allowing them to leave the cameras if it was too much.

More specifically, Furlong had trouble with drug abuse; Stahl was missing for several days and dropped off the acting radar due to his drug use; Dekker was arrested for DUI after running over a cyclist; Bale went ballistic and his rant on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">Terminator Salvation</a></em> became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>, as well as his domestic assault charge around the same time (he bounced back, though, with his later films).
</li><li> For some time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JakeLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JakeLloyd">Jake Lloyd</a> seemed to be very bitter and cynical about his role as Anakin Skywalker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em>, but since he went through high school and college with his classmates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">teasing him about it</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">other people</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">constantly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed">accusing</a> him of ruining <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, it's kinda hard to blame him for feeling so disillusioned. However, a later interview between him and a <em>Star Wars</em> fansite (as well as a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=697006523681359&amp;set=a.108672092514808.4720.100001160524846&amp;type=1">photo on his own Facebook page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) has shown that he's mellowed out since then and confirms that - contrary to popular belief - he does not hate the franchise after all the harassment.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> was ultimately a bigger star as an adult solo act, but he didn't completely subvert this trope. The abuse he suffered under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">his dad's</a> thumb as a child star affected him so very much that once he was able to stand on his own, he became obsessed with experiencing the childhood he never had growing up. Thus, most of his adult pursuits and interests were juvenile in nature and a way for him to "live as a kid" (i.e., building an amusement park on his property and holding slumber parties), and were reasons he became saddled with accusations of child molestation that hounded him for the rest of his life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WolfgangAmadeusMozart">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</a> was very much like Michael. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">His parents, particularly his father Leopold, made him and his sister Maria Anna child prodigies</a>, but most of his popular works <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">date from his later years</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland">Judy Garland</a> had some success into her twenties, still usually playing teenage roles, but she could never really transition into serious adult roles, and once her teenage stardom days were over, it was the beginning of the end for the "little girl with a great big voice." She developed a drug addiction, which stemmed from being given barbiturates by MGM to keep her active and working longer during her child star years. Her increasing difficulty to work with and nervous breakdowns certainly didn't help, as well as her greedy and jealous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a>. Two failed comeback attempts, five marriages, a few suicide attempts, and many health problems (including heavy smoking and drinking) later, she passed away from a barbiturate overdose at the very untimely age of 47 in 1969 (although because of her health problems, she arguably looked at least ten years older).
</li><li> Brad Renfro was 12 when he made his film debut in the critically-acclaimed film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheClient">The Client</a></em>, co-starring with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SusanSarandon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SusanSarandon">Susan Sarandon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyLeeJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyLeeJones">Tommy Lee Jones</a>.

Sadly, he spiraled into drug and alcohol abuse and died from a heroin overdose in January 2008 at the age of 25.
</li><li> The three lead kid actors on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiffrentStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DiffrentStrokes">Diff'rent Strokes</a></em> — Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges, and Dana Plato — became infamous for brushes with the law as adults. Plato ultimately died at 34 of a drug overdose which was ruled a suicide. Gary Coleman, meanwhile, struggled to recover before tragically dying at 42 from head trauma. Bridges, meanwhile, is a regular on TruTV's <em>The Smoking Gun Presents</em>, along with former <em>Partridge Family</em> cast member Danny Bonaduce, another example of a former child star who fell into serious problems as an adult (both Bridges and Bonaduce appear to be getting their lives on track at this point). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyCooksey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyCooksey">Danny Cooksey</a>, who played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver">Sam</a> in the final season, seems to have escaped the woes of his older cast mates, probably from a mix of good parenting, a successful voice acting career (and a failed music career), and a fairly normal adult life and marriage.
</li><li> Bobby Driscoll, who was Disney's golden boy during the 1940s, is a very sad case. He was in several Disney movies, and particularly famous for his roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SongOfTheSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SongOfTheSouth">Song of the South</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> (in which he played the title role), but was abruptly let go in the middle of the 1950s (allegedly at least partly because he developed terrible acne as he entered puberty, requiring heavy makeup to hide it). He was ridiculed in school for being a child star, acting roles dried up, and he became addicted to drugs. In 1968, he was found dead in an abandoned Manhattan building and the body wasn't identified until a year later. He was 31 years old.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnissaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnissaJones">Anissa Jones</a>, notable for playing Buffy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyAffair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyAffair">Family Affair</a></em>, was another sad case. When the show ended its run in 1971, she tried to find work in films, but no roles were coming. Brian Keith, who played her uncle on <em>Family Affair</em>, wanted to give her a part in his new TV project, but she no longer wanted to work in TV. Jones later fell into drug addiction and died in 1976 of an overdose at age 18. One contributing factor to her problems may have been that the producers and writers literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/NotAllowedToGrowUp">didn't let her grow up</a>  even though she had hit puberty by the time the series ended, she was still forced to act and appear as a preteen.
</li><li> Other than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKateAndAshleyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryKateAndAshleyOlsen">Olsen Twins</a>, just about all of the child/teenage actors who starred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em> have fallen out of the limelight.
<ul><li> Jodie Sweetin, in particular, stands out as an example of this trope played straight. Facing an inability to find further work and a traumatic social life due to being typecast as Stephanie Tanner, she became an alcoholic and a habitual user of marijuana, cocaine, LSD and most famously, meth. However, she seems to have gotten her life back on track, has published a memoir about her drug addiction, and is now seeking a comeback.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeifGarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeifGarrett">Leif Garrett</a> is an example of this, a child pop star who got embroiled with drugs and scandals. Currently a commentator on TruTV's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldsDumbest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WorldsDumbest">World's Dumbest...</a></em> alongside fellow former child stars Danny Bonaduce and Todd Bridges.
</li><li> There is an interesting contrast between the two stars of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuestFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuestFromTheFuture">Guest from the Future</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliaGuseva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliaGuseva">Natalia Guseva</a> acted in a few more movies but decided to become a scientist instead. Now, she not only works as a biochemist, but also is still involved with the fan community, and is raising a daughter. Meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexeiFomkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexeiFomkin">Alexei Fomkin</a> had a few more roles but got into drug problems, which caused him to lose roles and spiral further downward. He quit acting and moved to a village, which seemed to be straightening him out. Sadly, he died in 1996 when his apartment burned.
</li><li> Fellow Soviet child starlet, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katya_Lycheva">Katya Lycheva<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a contemporary of Guseva's, was not only loved for her work in children's films at home: she was also a goodwill ambassador who toured the United States at age 11 in 1986 and was part of the opening ceremonies of the Goodwill Games. Soon afterward, she withdrew into a reclusive lifestyle and stated in one rare interview that she prefers not to talk about her past fame.
</li><li> Robert Blake starred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OurGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OurGang">Our Gang</a></em> comedies (originally under his given name Mickey Gubitosi), then later starred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InColdBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InColdBlood">In Cold Blood</a></em> and had the title role on the TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baretta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Baretta">Baretta</a></em>, and years later was acquitted of his wife's murder, but lost a civil wrongful death lawsuit filed by his children.
</li><li> For a while, it looked as though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmandaShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmandaShow">Amanda Bynes</a> was shaping up to be an aversion; she had stated that she didn't like drinking or going to clubs and instead preferred to hang out at home with family and friends. That changed in 2012, however, when she was involved in several hit-and-run and reckless driving incidents, and continued into a series of increasingly erratic Twitter posts, including asking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Drake">Drake</a> to "murder her vagina". She was eventually <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Bynes#Legal_issues">diagnosed with schizophrenia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which explains the behavior, and was on involuntary psychiatric hold for several months in 2013.
</li><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> Ai Kago joined Morning Musume, one of the most popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Groups</a> in Japan, at age 12, and her popularity flourished when she was selected to join other units under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject">Hello! Project</a> name. However, as she grew older, she became dissatisfied with her image and started smoking to feel "older", though she was underage at that time. As a result of that (and entering a relationship with a man 10 years her senior), she was kicked out of Hello Project. While she did try to make a comeback, her career has continued to spiral downwards with numerous scandals including having an affair with a married man and dating a man rumored to have ties with the yakuza.
</li><li> Much of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleRascals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleRascals">The Little Rascals</a></em> (the original short films, also known as <em>Our Gang</em>), giving rise to the so-called "Our Gang Curse."
<ul><li> Norman Chaney (Chubby) suffered from a glandular ailment that caused him to weigh over 300 pounds (hence the nickname). He was given surgery to treat his condition but died of complications from said surgery. Depending on the report, he was either 18 or 22.
</li><li> Donald Haines and Bobby Hutchins (Wheezer) were WWII-related fatalities. Haines was killed in action at the age of 23 at the Kasserine Pass in Tunisia, while Hutchins (a member of the Army Air Corps) was killed just a few days shy of his 20th birthday when his plane crashed on landing during a training exercise.
</li><li> William Laughlin (Froggy) died in a scooter accident at the age of 16.
</li><li> Clifton Young (Bonedust) fell asleep while smoking and died in his hotel room from smoke inhalation at the age of 33.
</li><li> Carl Switzer (Alfalfa) was murdered over a gambling debt at the age of 31. Years later, his 42-year-old brother Harold Switzer (Slim/Deadpan) killed himself after killing his girlfriend.
</li><li> Scotty Beckett died of an overdose at the age of 38.
</li><li> Richard Daniels (Mickey) died alone in a hotel room of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 55.
</li><li> Kendall McCormas (Breezy Brisbane) committed suicide at age 64.
</li><li> Matthew Beard (Stymie) led a life of crime and drugs. Although he successfully cleaned up in the 1960s, he ultimately succumbed to a stroke at the age of 56.
</li><li> Darwood Kaye (Waldo) was killed by a hit-and-run driver at the age of 72.
</li><li> Jay R. Smith (Jay) was stabbed to death in Las Vegas at age 87 by a homeless man whom he had befriended.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyDandridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyDandridge">Dorothy Dandridge</a> was arguably the most successful former Rascal, even getting an Oscar nomination, but still fell on hard times and died of an overdose at 42.
</li><li> Several cast members died prematurely of cancer either in their late 50s or early 60s. These include:
<ul><li> Mary Kornman at age 57.
</li><li> Allen Hoskins (Farina) at age 59.
</li><li> Jackie Condon at age 59.
</li><li> Janet Burston at age 63.
</li><li> Sherwood Bailey (Spud) at age 64.
</li></ul></li><li> There were even some cast members who, despite leading normal lives, died relatively young nonetheless. They include:
<ul><li> George McFarland (Spanky) aged 64 from a heart attack or an aneurysm.
</li><li> John Collum (Uh-huh) at the age of 36 from a heart attack.
</li><li> Elmo Billings at the age of 51 from a stroke.
</li><li> Darla Hood (Darla) at the age of 47 of acute hepatitis from a blood transfusion given during an appendectomy.
</li><li> William Thomas (Buckwheat) at age 49 of a heart attack.

</li></ul></li><li> Those who did not die either tragically and/or prematurely mainly worked in menial or low-key jobs, making this a straight version of the trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Sawyer Sweeten, between the ages of sixteen months and ten years old, played Geoffrey Barone on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em> alongside his twin brother and older sister, who played his siblings. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/24/everybody-loves-raymond-actor-sawyer-sweeten-dies-aged-19">Sadly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> at the tender age of 19, for reasons that are not quite clear.
</li><li> Tatum O'Neal, the youngest person to ever win a competitive Oscar, never came close to recapturing the success she had with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaperMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaperMoon">Paper Moon</a></em>. She continued to stay in the spotlight for the rest of the decade but never achieved much success in adulthood.
<ul><li> Averted with her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleDarlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleDarlings">Little Darlings</a></em> co-star Kristy McNichol, who transitioned from child and teenage roles to adult comedies, particularly her role as Barbara Weston in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmptyNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmptyNest">Empty Nest</a>.</em> She retired from acting after her last role in 1998 and has lived a quiet life.
</li></ul></li><li> Butch Patrick, best known for playing Eddie Munster on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters">The Munsters</a></em> had a few more roles after the show was canceled, but then disappeared from the limelight. Since then, he mostly went onto having a normal life, and making appearances at conventions, though he did seek rehab treatment for drug addiction in 2010.
</li><li> Peter Robbins, the child actor who voiced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Charlie Brown</a> in the early specials (including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a></em>), is having troubles these days, getting arrested for threatening his girlfriend and stalking her plastic surgeon. The judge even sentenced him for mental examination after he went on a foul-mouthed tirade against the judge in court. Robbins was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. In 2015, he was sentenced to 4 years and 8 months for criminal threats.
</li><li> Carl Steven, the actor that played young Spock in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIIITheSearchForSpock">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></em>, and was the voice of Fred Jones in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/APupNamedScoobyDoo">A Pup Named Scooby-Doo</a></em> retired from acting in the mid-90s and seemed to be an aversion of this trope until around 2009 when he became addicted to heroin after being given it following a tonsillectomy. He later began stealing to support his addiction and was charged in 2010 of armed-robbing several pharmacies. He was sentenced to 13 years in prison where he died in July 2011 of a heroin overdose.
</li><li> Jason Davis, best known for voicing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Mikey Blumberg</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a> was arrested in 2011 for possession of a controlled substance. Sadly, in spite of seeking out help from Dr. Drew prior to his arrest and other attempts at rehab, he died of an overdose in February 2020.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosTheBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosTheBoss">Who's the Boss?</a></em>: While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlyssaMilano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlyssaMilano">Alyssa Milano</a> has done all right in her transition from child to adult roles, Danny Pintauro disappeared for the limelight for a long time. He has since revealed a history of meth addiction and is now HIV-positive.
</li><li> Filipino actor Jiro Manio was a child prodigy whose career peaked at the age of 10-11 when he appeared in the film <em>Magnifico</em>. Unfortunately, he got hooked on drugs as he hit his teens, and as the acting roles dried up, he was largely considered as a has-been before he reached the age of 20. He had recently made headlines after being found in a disheveled state, wandering around in Manila's airport after running away from home about four days prior. He went to rehab and exited in June 2017, but was arrested in January 2020 after allegedly stabbing another man three times.
</li><li> Another Filipino child star, CJ Ramos, reportedly developed a drug problem after he left show business in his late teens. At 32, he was arrested in July 2018 for drug possession, but that somehow led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection">Career Resurrection</a> as a cast member on <em>Ang Probinsyano</em>.
</li><li> Much has been said about Skylar Deleon being a "former <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> star convicted of double-murder," but the truth is he had only appeared as an extra in one episode. Nonetheless, he did act a bit as a child and teenager, before getting involved in crime as an adult.
</li><li> As far as child actresses go, Margaret O'Brien <em>ruled</em> the 1940s and early 1950s, boasting an impressive resume by the time she turned 12. As an adult, her film roles were few and far between, and she was only marginally more successful after transitioning to television.
</li><li> Jonathan Brandis was another sad case. He played young Bill in the original 1990 miniseries for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/It1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/It1990">It</a></em>, and later Lucas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV">seaQuest DSV</a></em>. However, his career fell on progressively hard times after that, something his friends say contributed to his heavy drinking and depression. He passed away on November 12, 2003, at the age of 27, after hanging himself.
</li><li> Blake Heron, best known as Marty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shiloh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shiloh">Shiloh</a></em>, didn't go onto much else, and tragically passed away on September 7, 2017, at the age of 35. He had struggled with drug addiction since the age of 12 and had recently completed rehab for heroin addiction.
</li><li> Tuesday Weld, a popular child/teen actress of the 1950s and early 1960s struggled with this hard, largely due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a> putting pressure on her as the breadwinner of her family. She had a nervous breakdown at age 9, struggled with alcoholism by age 12, and attempted suicide at least once. She emancipated herself at 16, and kept acting through her 20s, but eventually started turning down high-profile roles, and was completely out of the spotlight by the '70s, largely by choice. She's now a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">Reclusive Artist</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> actors:
<ul><li> While he wasn't exactly a star, Mark Salling was 14 when he acted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildrenOfTheCorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildrenOfTheCorn">Children of the Corn</a> IV</em>. After his appearance as Puck, Salling faced legal troubles after being accused of sexual battery by an ex-girlfriend, and later charged with possession of child pornography. He committed suicide on January 30, 2017, invoking the trope.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NayaRivera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NayaRivera">Naya Rivera</a> (Santana) had been a screen actress since she was a child, including a guest spot on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em> and a major role on Redd Foxx's last sitcom, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRoyalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRoyalFamily">The Royal Family</a></em>. After a rocky marriage that included domestic violence charges against her, Rivera died at 33 in a boating accident.
</li></ul></li><li> Tommy Kirk was best known for playing Travis Coates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OldYeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OldYeller">Old Yeller</a></em>, Joe Hardy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHardyBoys">The Hardy Boys</a></em> television serial, and Wilby in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShaggyDog">The Shaggy Dog</a></em>, among other appearances for Disney (including the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMickeyMouseClub">The Mickey Mouse Club</a></em>) in the late 50s/early 60s, but was fired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> himself in 1963, after he was caught in a relationship with a 15-year-old boy (Kirk was 22 at the time) and the boy's parents threatened to sue. As his career spiraled down, he turned to marijuana, alcohol, and prescription drug abuse, almost dying of an overdose at one point. He claims to being so high on a regular basis, he remembers very little about his later films. He lost out on a role in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a> film <em>The Sons of Katie Elder</em> after being arrested for marijuana possession, and he eventually went broke after spending his money on drugs. He career continued to dry up so badly, he took a couple of non-union jobs in the early-70s, almost losing his SAG card. He then finally gave up acting and sobered up, while officially coming out as gay. He was later inducted as a "Disney Legend" in 2006 (along with other original Mouseketeers), continues to make occasional appearances at fan conventions, and largely takes the blame for his own career downfall.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Sergey_Shevkunenko">Soviet child actor Sergey Shevkunenko's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> once-promising career degenerated into a string of assaults, home burglaries, drugs, weapons violations resulting in several prison sentences. In 1995, he was shot to death at age 35 along with his mother in the apartment they shared. Their murders remain unsolved.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Benitez#Life_after_acting_career">Manuel Benitez (AKA Mark Everett)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had roles in films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeeWeesBigAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeeWeesBigAdventure">Pee-wee's Big Adventure</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StandAndDeliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StandAndDeliver">Stand and Deliver</a></em> in his youth. After acting, he would go on to deal drugs, murder his girlfriend, and kidnap their son. He was later gunned down by police after holding his son hostage in a restaurant.
</li><li> Neil Hope, part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">large cast</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiJuniorHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiJuniorHigh">Degrassi Junior High</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DegrassiHigh">Degrassi High</a></em> did not act after the show ended in 1993. After his family drank away his TV earnings, he drifted into odd jobs and was an alcoholic, like his character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Wheels</a>, whose life was ruined by alcohol. He had become so isolated by the time of his death in 2007 that his family was unaware until <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/28/arts/television/neil-hope-dies-at-35-degrassi-actor-whose-life-unraveled.html">five years later<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Martin Stephens was a very in-demand child actor in the 50s and 60s, getting to act alongside stars such as Lana Turner, Stewart Granger, Deborah Kerr and Maureen O'Hara. At first with small parts, he really became famous for his starring roles as David in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VillageOfTheDamned1960" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VillageOfTheDamned1960">Village of the Damned (1960)</a></em> and Miles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInnocents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInnocents">The Innocents</a></em>. Although he kept acting into his teens, his final film was a small role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWitches1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWitches1966">The Witches (1966)</a></em> and he retired for good. He later confessed he'd been pushed into it by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a>, and did experiment with drugs a bit in his twenties, but ended up living a quiet life as an architect.
</li><li> His <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInnocents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInnocents">The Innocents</a></em> co-star Pamela Franklin made her debut in that very film and, although she achieved a lot of fame with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrimeOfMissJeanBrodie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrimeOfMissJeanBrodie">The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie</a></em> when she was nineteen (including a BAFTA nomination), those are still by far her most remembered roles. <em>The Legend of Hell House</em> typecast her as a scream queen and she retired from acting for good in the 70s after getting married. She now owns a first editions bookstore in West Hollywood.
</li><li> Maia Campbell is a heartbreaking case. Having been the daughter of famed author Bebe Moore Campbell, she found success by starring in <em>In The House</em> and appearing in popular works such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoeticJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoeticJustice">Poetic Justice</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210">Beverly Hills, 90210</a></em> and had gotten married and had a daughter. During the height of her success, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which she would habitually refuse to seek help for and instead self-medicated with drugs. A subsequent divorce, losing custody of her daughter and the 2006 death of her mother devastated her even as the two women were estranged at the time. In the years since then, she has unsuccessfully sought help from life coach Iyanla Vanzant, been arrested for disturbing the peace, had several videos surface of her displaying erratic and harrowing behavior while intoxicated in public and denied help from others concerned for her well-being.

In 2008, he was prosecuted for careless storage of a gun, receiving a sentence of three months' probation; later in the year he was convicted for possession of narcotics with the intention of trafficking, receiving an imprisonment sentence of six months. In 2010 he was fined for consuming alcohol in a public place. In 2011, he was convicted of threatening behavior with a weapon and jailed for 30 days, and received another conviction in that year for cashing forged bank checks. In 2016, he would be charged for his involvement in a bank robbery. Come 2018, production began on the documentary "Life After the Navigator" on his troubled post-film life.

</li><li> The main cast of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movies seem to have avoided the worst aspects of child acting.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RupertGrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RupertGrint">Rupert Grint</a>'s major claim to eccentricity is owning an ice cream truck, saying that if his career after the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies are finished falls through, he can always fall back on a career as an ice cream man.

</li><li> As for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson">Emma Watson</a>... much like her character, she has done very well in school work and has since decided that after her work with the movie series is done, she'll take a career break to finish her college degree as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NataliePortman">Natalie Portman</a> did. As of 2014, Watson graduated from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IvyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IvyLeague">Brown University</a> with a degree in English Literature. Film critic Leonard Maltin famously said that Watson was in "the early stages of babehood". Now that she's most certainly an adult and effectively an adult actress (and a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador to boot!), she is considered to have reached that milepost.

</li><li> Early productions of <em>Oliver!</em> featured Steve Marriott in the title role. Marriott infuriated his family by choosing music over acting, given that he'd already established success, but went on to be the extremely popular frontman for Small Faces and Humble Pie. However, his death in a house fire, probably from falling asleep with a lit cigarette, invokes the trope.

However, her mother never let her expand her career until she was 18, so she rarely performed outside Colombia and avoided events or appointments that could interfere with school. When she became an adult, the little exposure she had as a child let her become an international star as many people outside Colombia didn't even know about her and saw her as a new artist. While she definitely sexified her appearance, she did it after turning huge, and with much more modesty than other female pop artists of her generation.

After that, he worked regularly on both screen and stage until shortly before his death in April 2014 at the age of 93.

She seemed to be an aversion until numerous convictions for impaired driving, a stay in rehab, and some health problems defined this trope for her. She cleaned up, however, and has transitioned to adult roles, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack"> Orange Is the New Black</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RussianDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RussianDoll">Russian Doll</a></em>, which she also created.

In her teens she found herself doing more voice-overs, as she became camera shy and directors didn't like her braces. She has said she didn't intend to continue voice acting, convinced her distinctive high pitched voice would one day change. She studied to be a civil engineer but has kept up the voice acting. She was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">Reclusive Artist</a> until voicing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy</a> brought her to the limelight.

Then, he blew up and became a superstar. His ego soon followed and he became more known for his drinking, partying and love of strippers/prostitutes than singing. He made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerResurrection">comeback</a> in 2015 with the album <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Purpose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Purpose">Purpose</a></em> (with three straight #1 hits), and only time will tell if he'll stay there for long.
</li><li> Linda Blair played this trope straight for a while, but then subverted it. She's still best known for her role as Regan MacNeil in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">The Exorcist</a></em>, which scored her an Oscar nomination, and while filming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExorcistIITheHeretic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExorcistIITheHeretic">the sequel</a>, she was busted for possessing and selling cocaine. She found it very difficult to book roles after that, but cleaned up her act, and went onto making some more film and television appearances, mostly in trashy B-movies though. Today, she's living pretty well and makes appearances at horror conventions. She's also known for being a major animal rights activist, with her own charity called the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.lindablairworldheart.org/">Linda Blair World Heart Foundation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlyssaMilano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlyssaMilano">Alyssa Milano</a> began her career as a child star on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosTheBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhosTheBoss">Who's the Boss?</a></em> and had a brief stint as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> in Japan.

</li><li> Ken Weatherwax, who played Pugsley in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">Addams Family</a></em>, retired from acting after the show's cancellation, as he had no interest in being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Typecasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Typecasting">typecast</a> as the "funny fat kid". Unfortunately, returning to normal school was a struggle due to the minimal education he received onset, and he dropped out at 17 to join the military. After a few years in the service, he returned to Hollywood to work as a studio grip and served that role for 20 years. He quit primarily to care for his ailing mother, but also because he had grown tired of the hedonism and long hours of show-business. After her death in 2002, he went through bouts of homelessness and severe depression and contemplated suicide until a chance encounter introduced him to religion. Weatherwax became a born-again Christian and served happily with his church — while making occasional convention appearances — until passing away from a heart attack in 2014 at the age of 59.

<ul><li> The prognosis on former (child) stars on sports depend a lot on the sports in question, and especially on if it is a spectator sport if not. Many athletes who are involved in non-spectator sports, where a professional career is not an option, must plan their exit strategy already when they are on the top. Even career athletes do come one day to the point where they have to think of their exit strategy.
<ul><li> Individual competition sports (track and field, swimming, weightlifting, archery, etc.) athletes usually avert this trope completely, usually picking an academic or professional career after their active sports career. They usually plan their exit strategy well already on the prime of their career or exit while on the top.
<ul><li> Golf takes this aversion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Elite golfers regularly remain competitive well into their forties, and occasionally even into their fiftiesand that's when they're pitted against younger players. The U.S. has a very lucrative tour for men's golfers 50 and older, and several other such tours operate (most notably in Europe and Japan); players tend to stay competitive on those tours until their early sixties. (Women's golf has only recently started to launch senior tours.) On top of that, elite golfers of either sex can continue to rake in money from the sport even in retirement, thanks to endorsements and golf-related business opportunities, especially in course design. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackNicklaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackNicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a> has made many times more money just in designing courses than he did as one of the sport's greatest players.
</li></ul></li><li> Individual match-up sports (martial arts, tennis, boxing, etc.) may either avert or play this trope straight, depending on their exit strategy.
</li><li> Team competition sports (sailing, sledding, rowing, skydiving) usually avert this trope.
</li><li> Team match-up sports (football, ice hockey, basketball, baseball, etc.) usually (and sadly) play this trope straight, unless they are forced to exit their career prematurely [and have an exit strategy].
</li></ul></li><li> Ironically played with in the life of Micky Dolenz. He was the child star of <em>Circus Boy</em> for several years, after which his parents took him out of show business entirely to avert this trope. By all accounts, it worked... far better than when he gained and lost fame AGAIN as one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a>.
</li><li> Tero Niva, a very promising Finnish young actor, instead chose to become a software engineer rather than a professional actor.

</li><li> Intentionally played with by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, most famous as a Disney Channel star playing the squeaky-clean <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HannahMontana">Hannah Montana</a></em>. By age 18, she had semi-nude pictures of her posted on the internet, danced on a pole at the Teen Choice Awards, and became known for her taste for drugs when a video of her trying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GRatedDrug">salvia</a> spread online. She was expected to slide further into substance abuse and obscurity... before <em>Bangerz</em>, an album with a heavy hip-hop influence and references to all the drugs she was doing, was released, for which she did a famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicktastic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a> performance at the 2013 Video Music Awards - an attempt to invoke this trope as a conscious artist image. However, Miley, by all accounts, is quite well-adjusted out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> - she says the drug-addled trainwreck persona is, while closer to the truth than her child star personality, just something she does on stage; she has stated her interest in feminism, made fun of the moral panic about her, and even mentions she sticks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">social, non-addictive drugs</a> (ecstasy and weed) rather than the cocaine, booze, and heroin that has ruined the lives of so many child stars. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">Dolly Parton</a>, her father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyRayCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyRayCyrus">Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SnoopDogg">Snoop Dogg</a> and her frequent collaborator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlamingLips">Wayne Coyne</a>, among loads of journalists and interviewers, all say that she's actually a very normal, intelligent girl.
</li><li> The same applied in spadeloads to child star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharlotteChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharlotteChurch">Charlotte Church</a>, who shot to fame as an eleven-year-old cherub who sang hymns and religious-themed songs in a pure and angelic voice. The problem was that she grew up and maintained her voice and her singing career, but had a fan base that still only appeared to want a sweet innocent child singer. Supported by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">British Newspapers</a> that scented a narrative to make a story out of, fans were unreasonably disappointed and even outraged when she turned eighteen and was seen doing terrible things like going out for a drink and going out with boys. In short, Charlotte grew up into a perfectly normal and well-adjusted young woman, but a lot of fans refused to accept this.
</li><li> Downplayed with Kathryn Beaumont. When she gave up acting she became a teacher, but it's harder not to think of her as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AliceInWonderland">Alice</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Wendy</a>.
</li><li> Kirk Cameron, after a long run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrowingPains">Growing Pains</a></em>, several teen films in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, and gracing the cover of many a teen pinup magazine, became a born-again Christian. This led to much-publicized friction on the <em>Growing Pains</em> set.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4veud');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4veud" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4veud');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">During a <em>Growing Pains</em> reunion special, he apologized on-screen for his behavior at that time, indicating that he had trouble reconciling his new faith with his work. Cameron's former castmates accepted it.</span> He faded from the limelight but continued to act in Christian-themed productions and devote his life to ministry work, until he made controversial anti-gay marriage remarks. This led to a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1exVZ3hg08">video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by former child stars, poking fun at the comments and supporting gay marriage.
</li><li> German actress Romy Schneider (most well-known for her Sissi movies, which were a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalResearchFailure">Historical Research Failure</a> romanticized biopic on the otherwise tragic life of the Austrian Empress Elisabeth) got into acting when 15 years old, under the tutelage of her mother. In a bit of a version of this trope, she decided for herself to act, despite her parents (both rather famous film and stage actors of their time) being against it. Eventually she got tired of being typecast as squeaky-clean (potentially royal) teenagers (roles handpicked by her stepfather who wanted to capitalize on her as much as possible and her mother who wanted her to keep a wholesome virginal image) and left Germany/Austria as soon as the last movie of the "Sissi" trilogy was finished because all the prospect roles she was being offered were pale imitations of her Sissi character. Later she'd take up the role of Empress Elisabeth again as a personal favor for her friend director Luchino Visconti in his film <em>Ludwig II</em>; where she now played Elisabeth as a mature, serious, and cynical woman. Radically different compared to the cute teenage (and historically inaccurate) "Empress Sissi" she hated portraying in her youth. Romy worked continuously in France, Italy, and sometimes the US because the filmmakers there offered her more serious roles than in her native Germany and Austria, and achieved much acclaim there on both the screen and on stage; and boy did the Germans hate her for this perceived "betrayal" and "corruption" of her youthful virginal image. Romy's life was beset with failed marriages, the death of her only son (in an eerie coincidence with the life of the actual Empress Elisabeth), and a huge debt incurred by her stepfather who invested her money into his own chain of restaurants. She died at age 43 from heart failure and is still well-known today both for her youthful roles as virginal naive aristocratic heroines and her later, more mature and darker works.

</li></ul></li><li> Aversions:
<ul><li> Huntz Hall stayed with the Bowery Boys series until the very end, and though he had the odd career hiatus, he continued to find acting jobs until the early 1990s. Not that he needed the money, as he had become wealthy through investment in offshore oil and gas drilling.
</li><li> Gabriel Dell transitioned to adult roles in the Bowery Boys films before leaving the series in 1950. He spent three years at the Actors' Studio, and had perhaps the most successful solo acting career of the Dead End Kids, finding steady work on Broadway and in films and television (he was a regular supporting player on <em>The Steve Allen Show</em> in the late 1950s) until the early 1980s.
</li><li> Bernard Punsly<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7j07n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7j07n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7j07n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Not "Punsley" as it was often misspelled</span> retired from acting in 1943 at the age of 20 and became a doctor (even as an actor, he would read medical textbooks between takes), maintaining a private practice and being a hospital chief of staff in the greater Los Angeles area. He was also married just once, for over fifty years (ending with his death aged 80), and had two children.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8vqxt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8vqxt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8vqxt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Though Punsly claimed never to watch his old films, feeling he had grown out of them, he did join Huntz Hall, the only other living former Dead End Kid, for the unveiling of the group's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Kimberly J Brown was a very successful television child actress in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">the late 90s</a>, famous for her work as Marnie in the original three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloweentown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloweentown">Halloweentown</a></em> films, <em>Quints</em> (all on Disney Channel), and a long-running stint on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight">Guiding Light</a></em>. In 2006, Disney controversially replaced her as Marnie for <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnToHalloweentown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnToHalloweentown">Return To Halloweentown</a></em> for unknown reasons, and Kimberly didn't have another notable role until 2013 when she was a regular on the short-lived <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LowWinterSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LowWinterSun">Low Winter Sun</a></em> on AMC. However, despite her faded career, she's maintained a very normal personal life and is very accessible to her fans on social media.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos">The Sopranos</a></em> finished its run, Robert Iler (A.J. Soprano) did a few bit roles on television but largely retired from acting to become a professional poker player.
</li><li> Dylan and Cole Sprouse had very successful child acting careers that included roles <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BigDaddy">Big Daddy</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GraceUnderFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GraceUnderFire">Grace Under Fire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> that were capped off with a six-year run on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSuiteLifeOfZackAndCody">The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a></em> and its spin-off <em>Suite Life on Deck</em>. After <em>On Deck</em> finished, the two took a break from acting to attend New York University. Once they graduated, Cole returned to Hollywood and landed the role of Jughead on the hit series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale">Riverdale</a></em>. Meanwhile, Dylan is still in retirement while he runs <a class="urllink" href="http://www.allwisemeadery.com/about">his own meadery<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Canadian child actor Gil Filar, best known for playing Boobull in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNoddyShop">The Noddy Shop</a></em>, retired from acting as a teen and became an author.
</li><li> Two of the Phoenix brothers provide a straight example and an aversion.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RiverPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RiverPhoenix">River Phoenix</a> had a skill for acting far beyond anyone else in his generation, but couldn't cope with the pressures of fame and hated that he was part of a system he despised. He turned to drugs and wound up dying of an overdose in 1993 at the age of 23.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoaquinPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoaquinPhoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a>, however, transitioned successfully into a critically-acclaimed adult acting career in such films as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gladiator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gladiator">Gladiator</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WalkTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WalkTheLine">Walk the Line</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMaster">The Master</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Her" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Her">Her</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Joker2019">Joker (2019)</a></em>, the latter of which gaining him an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Award</a>. Although he played up to the trope with his extended breakdown in the fake-autobiographical <em>I'm Still Here</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Tony DeFranco became a teen sensation in the early 1970's when he and his siblings - The DeFranco Family - scored a #1 hit with the song "Heartbeat - It's a Lovebeat". A couple of follow-up singles later (none of which did as well as their initial hit), and the DeFranco Family faded into obscurity. However, as fleeting as his fame was as a singer, Tony DeFranco has enjoyed more sustained success in his second career in real estate.
