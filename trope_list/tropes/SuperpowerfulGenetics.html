</p><p>Normally, heredity is a messy affair; it's often described as a game of chance. Thanks to Darwin, Mendel, Watson and Crick, it can be explained a good deal better, but much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a>, what traits a child will inherit from each parent are mostly random. Not so with superpowers. Children of "supers" can have a limited number of things happen:
</p><p></p><ol><li> Develop identical powers to their parent(s).
</li><li> Develop radically different (and usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">insanely powerful</a>) powers from the parent(s).
</li><li> Develop powers that are a twist on their parent's powers, or a combination, if both parents are supers (though this happens much less often than the above two).
</li><li> Inherit their parent's <em>skills</em>; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Lamarck Was Right</a>.
</li><li> Inherit no powers or skills at all, then eventually manifest them.
</li><li> Inherit no powers or skills at all, for keeps this time; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages">Muggle Born of Mages</a>
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Super-power inheritance tends to happen more often than could be ascribed to chance; a non-powered child of even a hero and a normal person is an exception. Super-powers seem to be "more dominant than dominant" (more common than genetics should allow).
</p><p>If a parent's powers are caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics">gene splicing</a>, or from being born a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">mutant</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">part</a> or full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">alien</a>, then it gets interesting. Specific powers actually have a higher chance of <em>not</em> being inherited. In such cases, the child usually gets a completely different power, or at best one that's only tangentially related. This becomes much likelier if both parents have different powers. Only occasionally will they just have a combination of their parents' powers; this tends to happen if the parents' powers are very simple, or if the series was designed around the child, and the parents were brought in as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">Secret Legacy</a>. If this happens often enough, it may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">revealed</a> that all the powers of that family are just different expressions of the same gene as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin">Meta Origin</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> repeatedly shows that hybrids of humans and super-powerful aliens produce insanely powerful offspring. Lampshaded by Vegeta, when he notes that he trained intensely to unlock his Super form, while his hybrid kid can do it for fun. If a child is conceived after the father has unlocked said Super form, that child will be able to do so with essentially no effort, in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Lamarck Was Right</a>. If the child was born beforehand, it's quite a bit more difficult. They're crazy powerful regardless, though. The only real exception to this out of ALL the half-saiyan children is Vegeta's daughter Bra, who he apparently chooses to dote on rather than train.
<ul><li> Before any of that, this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in the Cell saga, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was created from the genes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics">most of the heroes</a>. This gave him all of their strengths and their deadliest techniques.
<ul><li> In the future, descendants of Vegeta and Goku don't even realize the significance of their Super forms other than noting their hair turns yellow.
</li></ul></li><li> The author admitted he had no idea what to do with or even how to handle a female Super Saiyan so he just ignored Bra.
</li><li> Frieza and his father owe their devastating power to the fact that they are an unique mutant offshoot of their race. When Frieza decides to combine that devastating inherent power with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">actual training</a> , the results prove to be dramatic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>, insane Nen-potential seems inherited just like insane physical potential.
</li><li> Tenchi Masaki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> is slightly over one quarter Juraian (his father happens to be a descendant of his maternal grandfather). Juraian's are an alien race with a tendency to develop Jedi-like powers with training (the royal family being stronger as well). He's also <em>the</em> most powerful "Juraian" in existence; capable of manifesting three "lighthawk wings", one of the most powerful defensive/offensive attacks known. A typical Juraian <em>space ship</em> is capable of manifesting only <em>one</em>.
<ul><li> OVA Tenchi is most likely disqualified from this as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's the avatar of his dimension's <em>god</em></span>. However, the one from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a></em> more than qualifies as it's said that his own Juraian power was passed down from his mother, who was pretty damn powerful in her own right.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, the Musk Dynasty bore offspring through wild, powerful animals that had been thrown into the Spring of Drowned Girl, thus turning them into women. Their children would then inherit traits exhibited by, or closely related to, their mothers' natural form. Hence, Mint's superhuman scent, hearing, and speed (born from a wolf); Lime's grotesquely overpowered physical strength (born from a tiger); and Herb's ability to fly and discharge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">his ki</a> in devastating streams (born from a dragon). One episode of the anime hinted that children of a cursed parent will inherit that parent's curse—but that episode was all one of Ranma's nightmares, so it's not canon.
</li><li> Type 1 was intentionally done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">the Kings of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Ancient Belka</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>. The modifications on their bodies were not only meant to turn them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Persons Of Mass Destruction</a>, but to force the powers they gained unto their future descendants as well.
</li><li> A number of ninja clans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> have special genetic powers referred to as "kekkei genkai", or "bloodline limit". These include eyes that can copy others' abilities, being able to manipulate and regrow your own bones, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a> which are formed by combining any two of the basic five elemental affinities (for example, Water + Wind = Ice), etc. There are also abilities that <em>seem</em> like this, but are actually just well-kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">clan</a> secrets, such as the Nara clan's ability to manipulate shadows.
<ul><li> However, genetic powers aren't always passed down. The best example of this is the First Hokage's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">wood release</a>, which was entirely unique to his DNA, with none of his descendants inheriting it. Another partial example would be the Fourth Kazekage, since only his youngest son inherits his power of magnetism.
</li><li> Unlocking the Rinnegan, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ultimate form of the Sharingan</span>, requires combining the genes of the Senju and the Uchiha clans, the respective descendants of the Sage of Six Path's two opposing sons. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Madara Uchiha awakened his Rinnegan by stealing a small piece of Hashirama Senju's flesh and grafting it onto his own body. Sasuke Uchiha later also later gets the Rinnegan (but only in his left eye; the right remains a Mangekyo Sharingan) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">just in time for the last battles of the series</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo">Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo</a></em>, Maitel is a 3rd cousin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Medusa</a>. Naturally, this means he can turn people to stone too.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily">Joseph Joestar</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> could use his grandfather's sun channeling abilities from a very young age, although he had to train them for them to be effective against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Pillar Men</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Quincy powers are hereditary, leading to an clan-wide obsession with bloodlines.
</li><li> Ichigo and Karin can see ghosts, Yuzu can see faint outlines of them, and Ichigo eventually became a Shinigami with an extremely high amount of spirit energy. Why? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Their father Isshin is a retired Shinigami, and has all the same powers Ichigo does, at a Captain's class. Ichigo also inherits hollow and Quincy powers from their mother's side that make his attempts to master his abilities very complicated.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> come about in this way, thanks to the 'bloodline' of the original experiments. It's possible for a weapon to show up in a family that hadn't had one for a very long time, which we see is what happened with Soul Eater himself. For some reason, the Nakatsukasas had come to expect that the eldest child would inherit the Morph Weapon abilities. When this did not happen, things did not end well. Kid falls definitely into the 'will eventually inherit' category, as BREW so helpfully showed off.

<ul><li> The children of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> members Reed and Susan Richards show two variations.

<ul><li> Valeria is currently a super-genius; at three years old she was already Reed-class, and it's later confirmed that this is her power. Franklin is currently partially powered after the last time he pushed his omnipotence into overdrive, essentially recreating the multiverse with his family. At his maximum, he is potentially one of the most powerful beings in the entire multiverse; characters who can make Galactus sit up and beg were afraid of him for a while. When he has powers, there's usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainingBolt">Restraining Bolt</a> (imposed by him or others depending on the timeline) on them that limits him to helpful but not god-tier psychic abilities.

Many other DC characters avoid this trope by having their successors or apprentices come with their own origins.
<ul><li> This was played with when Flash Wally West fathered twins. Although both had powers based on speed, his son's ability was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">super-accelerated growth of muscle tissue</a>, and his daughter could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntangibleMan">vibrate through objects</a>. Then it got even weirder when their powers went berserk, and for a very brief time, they had what seemed to be time-based powers instead: he could turn into prehistoric animals and she could accelerate the flow of time. Now she has basic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> and he's unpowered.
<ul><li> You can always say in this case that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">the Speed Force did it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Another example of a superpowered lineage could be found in the DCU <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Manhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Manhunter">Manhunter</a></em> series. Kate comes from a long line of metahumans. Her great grandfather Hugo Danner, grandfather Arnold "Iron" Munroe and father Walter Pratt were all superhuman. While Kate herself is not fully-superhuman, she is unusually strong and tough and it is implied that she is a borderline metahuman. Her son Ramsey inherits powers that easily exceed any of his ancestors. He is also an extremely rare fifth generation metahuman.

While her mom did use her powers to save people she always remained anonymous never taking on a superhero identity, and was murdered by her mutant hating husband when he learned she was a metahuman.
</li><li> The whole Force family is made up of superpowered individuals whose meta-genes tend to activate in strange ways not resembling other family members, and who have had activated meta-genes at least since the age of the Roman Empire. The family disapproves of flashy heroics and prefers to help the world in smaller or more subtle ways, such as working as a doctors for metahumans that normal doctors don't have the ability to treat and most of them live on the family farm in British Columbia.

Blindside's status as twice orphaned means and the fact that his last name doesn't match up (both Hoods were Thurstons, Blindside's name is Tyson Gilford) means he has trouble confirming this.
</li><li> The main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> tend to have superpowers corresponding to those of their parents. Many of these "powers" are magical or technological gifts.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, Molly Hayes initially appears to have not gotten the mutant gene despite her parents both having it. Early on in the story however, she is discovered to have super strength (while both parents had mind controlling powers, and <em>her</em> strength turns out to be psionic in nature). Karolina has exactly the same alien powers as her parents which her mother points out means that none of them can hurt each other. Chase is the son of two brilliant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> types, but his abilities run more to minor cleverness, street smarts and punching things. Gert has a pair of travelling also mad scientists (but more biology based) for parents and though she is gifted with their intelligence, her power is actually something they engineered for her - being psychically linked with a bio-engineered Deinonychus (think <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> Raptor).

The premise of the comic is an elementary school for children with superpowers, many of which have heroes as parents. The main character, however, is a new student, the child of two of the most powerful heroes in the world, who has no powers whatsoever. (His parents are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">simply convinced that their son's powers have not yet manifested, as he will be as powerful as they are</a> - as it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he doesn't, but his clone is a vastly powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a></span>.) As the story has developed, it is becoming increasingly clear that the character is the school's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> in training.

He argues that eventually, competition for mates, evolution of powers and crossbreeding of metahuman with metahuman will lead to the piling on of powers over several generations, creating more and more powerful superpowered children until eventually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GooGooGodlike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GooGooGodlike">Goo Goo Godlike</a> scenario and the probable destruction of planet Earth.

And not only are they ludicrously powerful psychics (depending on the state of Cable's techno-organic virus), with Nate being stated to have the raw power of Dark Phoenix at the tender age of 17, they also have a host of other powers: Rachel's capable of manipulating time (sending her mind through it and travelling through it); Cable's virus comes with a host of technopathic powers/physical enhancements, more limited temporal powers, and possibly teleport (it's ambiguous how much at full power is him and how much is tech); and Nate Grey is a fully fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> directly compared to the above mentioned Franklin Richards, he can step in and out of time as he pleases, see the future (or at least, a number of possibilities), and transform into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">Energy Being</a> and back as he pleases.

That being said, at least one version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Wanda</a>'s origin had it that her "natural" mutant ability was some form of energy manipulation, like her father, but she "attuned" to the magical energies around Wundagore Mountain, resulting in her "Chaos Magic". (This was before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Dr Strange said there was no such thing as Chaos Magic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">then denied that he would ever make such a claim, OF COURSE Chaos Magic is real</a>).

Nightcrawler is likewise (supposedly) the child of an ages-old mutant clan with interdimensional powers, and Angel is implied to be from an angel-like mutant bloodline as well.
</li><li> Clan Akkaba are descendants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Apocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>, and each member has inherited variations on his powers. The greater families, including the Slades, have a weaker version of Apocalypse's shape-shifting and longevity, and a minority also possess his grey skin. The 'Lesser' members have different and unique powers, such as Jack Starsmore, who can instead breathe fire. More rarely, shapeshifting members randomly gain additional mutations, such as Frederick Slade, who has pink hair, solid green eyes and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> teleportation, shared with his descendant Blink</span>.

Cassie Lang shares the same growth powers as her father Scott, however this was from her stealing Pym particles and not inheritance (her father's superpowers weren't genetic). While Patriot has no powers from birth, he does get superhuman strength from his grandfather (formerly one of the Captain Americas) via blood transfusion. Meanwhile, FF foe the Wizard is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> with no powers, but being around gravity-manipulating technology most of his life lets him have a daughter who controls gravity innately.

The X-factor and Inhuman genes <em>cancel each other out</em>, leaving Luna an effectively baseline human. Her dad, driven crazy (well, crazier) by the loss of his powers thanks to M-day, exposed her to a heavy dose of Terrigen Mist to correct this "error". Thankfully, it worked. Luna survived (though she developed a bit of an addiction to the Mist) and gained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">empath</a> powers.

Generally, these powers have nothing to do with their parents' powers (except the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Burnout</a> inherited his father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> powers for about a week).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zenith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zenith">Zenith</a></em> is a slight subversion; he does get his parents' powers, just not <em>all</em> of them, and they don't work all the time.
</li><li> Marvel's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals">Eternals</a></em> avert this; they can breed with mortals, but the kids are just normal humans. This plays a part in Ikaris' tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> (here's a hint; he took the name Ikaris in honor of his late son).
<ul><li> Eternals breeding with Eternals rarely produces offspring, but they are full Eternals—except for the Titanians, who originally only had half the power of the Earth Eternals, and whose current population are descended from both sides of the "family", resulting in wildly varying power levels and longevity. Then there's the Ritter twins, children of an Eternal and a Deviant (another offshoot of humanity with constant mutations); they appear as normal humans but can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a> into either one or two Eternal-powered beings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos">Thanos</a> wields far greater power than the average Titanian Eternal due to a mutation that also made him look like a Deviant. His mother tried to kill him when he was born since she (rightly) believed he would be a monster later in life, but his father spared him because he (also rightly) thought an Eternal/Deviant mutant had great potential.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a>.</em> Invincible's super-powered alien dad explicitly has genes that beat up and take over the genes of whatever he mates with, creating offspring that are almost identical to himself, powers included. Case in point, he also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSkittyOnWailordAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotSkittyOnWailordAction">mates with a humanoid praying mantis girl</a> and produces a child who looks perfectly human except for his purple skin. And even the purple skin vanishes with age, making him look fully human.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superman">Superman</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Man of Steel has no canonical descendants, though the issue has been explored in many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld">"imaginary" stories</a>. Classically his children with a human wife have all his powers at half power level. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanAndBatmanGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanAndBatmanGenerations">Generations</a> storyline affirms this with halving occurring with each successive generation. One Elseworlds had one of Kal-El's Ancestors land on Earth and take over, with each successive generation being less powerful to the point that Kal-El himself had no powers and his father was barely superhuman.
<ul><li> The current <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanRebirth">Superman (Rebirth)</a></em> story subverts this, with Jon Kent being both canonical and potentially even more powerful than Superman himself.
</li></ul></li><li> More recent examples of his offspring include a child of Superman and Wonder Woman who ended up being an alternate version of the Phantom Stranger. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCOneMillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCOneMillion">DC One Million</a></em>, his offspring apparently retain their powers through successive generations and gain new ones by intermarrying with various species including a 5th dimensional being, forming a Superman Dynasty. Superman himself returns in this timeline after hundreds of thousands of years transformed by exotic energies and gaining the ability to bestow additional powers on his offspring. The Superman of the 853rd century, a direct descendant of Superman, is like our Superman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">on steroids</a>.
</li><li> The aforementioned <em>Generations</em> storyline has an odd instance of a type 5 in Superman's son Joel Kent who would have had his powers had he not been exposed to Gold Kryptonite in the womb. Much to Joel's bitterness and dismay, his younger sister was not exposed and ended up a type 1.
</li><li> Hinted at in another 'maybe' story. Superman officially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">died ten years before the story begins. While a reporter is talking to a now-married Lois Lane for an anniversary article on events, her baby boy is seen crawling around. After her husband comes home, the baby is playing by the fireplace with a piece of coal. The next frame shows the baby in the same place playing with a diamond. No, they did not find a body ten years before.</span>
</li><li> In the <em>New 52</em>, Superboy was revealed as the clone of the future son of Superman and Lois Lane, Jon Lane Kent, who was raised by a metahuman hater called Harvest to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon">Living Weapon</a> - and both he and Superboy were, for whatever reason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">massively powerful psychics</a>, though they were hinted to have more classic physical superpowers too. No one had any particular idea as to why.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Hulk's</a> kids are an interesting case. His son, Skaar, inherited both his parents' power sets - giving him the power to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">control the earth</a> in addition to the Hulk's powers. His twin brother Hiro-Kala only got the tectonic powers. His daughter Lyra, created via genetic engineering, got only a measure of the Hulk's superstrength; instead, she developed the ability to attune herself to gamma radiation - in combat, she can almost always position herself exactly where she needs to be. Unfortunately, thanks to deliberate tampering in her creation, the angrier Lyra gets, the <em>weaker</em> she gets.
<ul><li> It's later revealed that Hiro-Kala <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is a Hulk as well, but has never hulked out. And his transformation is triggered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove">by love</a>.</span> Also, his tectonic abilities are absurdly powerful by his race's standards.
</li><li> And it turns out all Gamma mutates are descended from a single common ancestor who had the latent genetic trigger that causes gamma radiation to grant superpowers as opposed to nasty radiation sickness.
<ul><li> Not all; Bruce Banner's mentor, Professor Gregory Crawford, who discovered said genetic trigger while examining Bruce's blood, found a way to copy it through genetic manipulation, which he used to turn himself into the Gamma mutate Ravage. It's also suggested that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHulk">Red Hulk</a> and Red She-Hulk didn't have the genetic marker themselves, and were only created and stabilized after significant genetic modification.
</li><li> Betty Ross (Red She-Hulk) has the genetic marker, as Modok had previously turned her into the gamma-mutate the Harpy to use her against the classic Green Hulk (her Red She-Hulk status being a result of combined gamma and cosmic ray exposure).

His mother's electrical powers were given to her later in life, so they must have caused genetic changes, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Doctor Nirvana's</a> experiment.

</li><li> Avoided in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross">Charles Stross</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMerchantPrincesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMerchantPrincesSeries">The Merchant Princes Series</a></em> - the single superpower is caused by a recessive gene, and the inheritance is consistent.
</li><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">Wild Cards</a></em> anthology series. Superpowers are caused by the Wild Card virus, which can be passed on by either parent, and is always passed on if both parents have it. However, only 1% of infected people become super powered "aces," regardless of how they were infected. This means the child of two aces is 9% likely to become a deformed mutant, and 90% likely to die a horrible death.
<ul><li> One ace character must break off his engagement to his childhood sweetheart when he finds out she has the virus too— and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">can't even tell her why</a>.
</li><li> There is one case of an ace having a daughter with identical powers, but this is explained by saying he psychically manipulated her genetic structure in the womb. If there was a trope for Suspiciously Specific Superpowers, that guy would be the Trope Maker.
</li><li> The Psi Lords of Takis have inheritable powers, which is to be expected since they are the products of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperBreedingProgram">Super Breeding Program</a> specifically geared towards perpetuating their telepathic abilities into successive generations. The traits appear to be dominant, but can still breed out over generations. For example, Dr. Tachyon's grandson (by way of ordinary humans) Blaise exhibited stronger-than-normal mind control, but no other telepathic abilities, suggesting that Psi Lord powers are not all derived from a single gene.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, it's quite common for a magical child to be born to two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a> parents, which <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfBeedleTheBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfBeedleTheBard">The Tales of Beedle the Bard</a></em> explains as so-called "Muggle-borns" actually having wizarding ancestors somewhere in the family tree. Which seems to indicate that magic is a recessive trait. However, nearly every person with at least one magical parent is magic themself, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages">Squibs</a> exist but are incredibly rare. This doesn't fit with a recessive allele, but a dominant one doesn't actually make <em>more</em> sense. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> abounds, naturally, most of which points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">this is magic we're talking about</a>.
</li><li> A version occurs in one of the <em>Serendipity</em> books when a pegasus mare mates with a mortal stallion. When she turns out pregnant, a wise old mare explains that the child could be born with either legacy. Turns out he's born with tiny, tiny wings, obviously unable to let him fly - but still the mother thinks perhaps they'll grow. However, by the time she must leave (for if she stays, she too will lose the ability to fly), the wings are as small as ever. She wings away into the clouds, trying to ignore the cries of her terrified child. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But the series being full of magic and generally using happy endings (even with bittersweet overtones), the foal comes up after her, in those few minutes having sprouted (through willpower alone) wings large enough to carry him.</span>

It's indicated in <em>Damia's Children</em> that more powerful Talents usually but not always have more powerful children. Sometimes a powerful and a 'weak' talent can produce some truly remarkable results.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series, wizardry is known to run in families, though it probably has more to do with inherited traits The Powers think make a good wizard more than any "wizardry gene" since the power has to be offered by them and accepted through the Wizards Oath. In Nita's family there's Dariane, her aunt and offscreen, her great-grandmother, all on her father's side.
</li><li> Both the ability to manifest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni">Deryni</a> powers and the Haldane potential (apparently a variant) are transmitted genetically; the trait is dominant, so only one parent needs to have the trait for an offspring to inherit it. Thus, so-called "half-breeds" are just as powerful as full-blooded Deryni. Deryni generally need to be taught to use their powers; carriers of the Haldane potential need no training, but must have the potential triggered by a outside action. This is usually done in a ritual, the specifics of which vary slightly from one generation to the next; certain heirloom objects are used, and new ones may be added.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a>, Force Sensitivity is clearly heritable.
<ul><li> It's kind of annoying how each new child of the Skywalker line is touted as having the Strongest Potential Ever. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">I, Jedi</a></em> Corran learns that the creation of illusions and permutations of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JediMindTrick">Jedi Mind Trick</a>, ability to absorb and convert or channel energy, and the inability to use telekinesis unless currently channeling energy are all Halcyon family traits, and his grandfather was a Halcyon. Over time he manifests each trait. Jedi who are not Skywalker-descended can have non-Jedi siblings and relatives whose weak Force-Sensitivity manifests as things such as a bit of "luck" and accurate hunches.
</li><li> It seems like that if a Force-Sensitive is cloned, the clones will themselves be Force-Sensitive, as shown with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight">Jorus C'baoth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">Joruus C'baoth</a>. Though the clone's origins are mysterious enough that it is entirely possible Palpatine created and discarded dozens of C'baoth clones before getting one with the original's power. The clone also makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">clone of Luke</a>, but the Luuke clone might not have been a Force user.
</li><li> When Vader clones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">Starkiller</a>, the clone retains the original's extremely strong abilities (the original could pull a Star Destroyer from the sky, while the clone can disintegrate anyone around him with a Force wave and super-charge a ship turret to blow up a Star Destroyer). Additionally, Vader's attempts resulted in dozens of failed clones who still exhibit powerful abilities.
</li><li> One of the drawbacks of cloning Force Users though (therefore why neither the Jedi nor the Sith do so to shore up their numbers) is that cloned Force Users tend to be mentally unstable.
</li></ul></li><li> Several of the creators of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom">Old Kingdom</a> invested their power in specific bloodlines.

This is part of a villain's plot in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>White Night</em>, when some of the White Court start killing off female magical practitioners too weak for the White Council to notice, on the logic that this will interfere with future generations of wizards and they can afford to wait.</span>

Centuries worth of selective marriage among the nobility have led to the High Lords all being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">insanely</a></em> dangerous, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">the First Lord even more so</a>.
<ul><li> Complicated by the fact that sufficiently skilled crafters can pass control of their pokemon on or before death, giving multiple meanings to "inherit their power".
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElvenbane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElvenbane">The Elvenbane</a></em>, powerful elvish spellcasters produce children who are powerful, weak casters produce weak children, and intermarriage between strong and weak produces a child of intermediate power. At least in the first book, it's never explained where powerful spellcasters came from in the first place, but their attempts to stay powerful through the generations have led to severe inbreeding. Human spellcasting is also inherited, but in defiance of the trope it's an indirect and imprecise pattern. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11067');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11067" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11067');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Elves and humans aren't even from the same world, so the implication is that human magical power is determined through standard genetics, with multiple genes influencing power levels, and elvish magical power is determined through something else entirely.

<ul><li> Lampshaded in a narrative comment on how the elves don't really understand human inheritance or fertility.

C. Hodgell, the Highborn of the Kencyr can at times be so psionic that their powers blur the boundaries of reality.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mistborn">Mistborn</a></em> setting, genetics plays a direct part in whether or not someone is born with Allomantic or Feruchemical powers. As a result, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Lord Ruler</a> set up a deliberate program and laws to control the superhuman genetics, with only nobles being allowed to have Allomancy, and killing any of the "skaa" commoners who possess these powers (and going so far as to mandate the execution of any skaa woman whom a nobleman sleeps with) as well as genociding anyone with Feruchemy.

For example, the twins Will and Jill Murray are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technopath">Technopath</a>, respectively.

In addition, both the Desoto siblings have inherited their grandfather's abilities, although he can control both light and shadow (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's also the first costumed Hero, Captain Starlight</span>). Chad Taylor's ability is nearly identical to his father's, and he even manages to replicate some of his father's tricks.

It's eventually revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her primary ability is very similar to that of one of her uncles', who also happens to be a professor at her university</span>. Hershel/Roy's ability is remotely similar to their father's, although not for reasons they initially think (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they initially assume that, since Titan is a strongman, then this is why Roy has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>; however, Titan's true power is adaptation, and so is Hershel's, except, in the latter case, he manifests Roy as his stronger alter-ego.

Each branch of the family has a different special quality (Lucians are leaders and schemers, Ekatrina are genius scientists, Tomas are gifted athletes, and Janus are great artists) due to their ancestors (siblings Luke, Katherine, Thomas, and Jane Cahill) each taking one-fourth of a serum (meant to cure the bubonic plague) which gives the imbiber all of those qualities. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The fifth branch, the Madrigals, don't have any genetic special quality, since their ancestor Madeline Cahill was born after the serum's creator had died.

He possesses Vulcan anatomy, as well as their telepathic powers. In fact, the only time the physical aspect of his human ancestry comes up is in regards to his viability as a blood donor for his father.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Deanna Troi</a> is half-Betazoid/half-human.

Deanna seems to have inherited a watered-down version of these, being mainly empathic, but able to communicate telepathically with other telepaths. It comes up on the show that most Betazoid descendants with three-quarters human ancestry do not generally exhibit any psionic ability.
</li><li> In one very peculiar instance of non-genetic superpower inheritance depicted in the episode <em>True Q</em>, a young, seemingly human, woman born to two parents who were secretly members of the Q Continuum is herself a Q, complete with functional omnipotence that she is unaware of. To all available tests she seems to be human. But Q causes her to invoke her powers by triggering a warp core breach while she is in Engineering, leading her to instinctively use her powers to stop it.

Sheppard himself says about the puddlejumper that "a lot of fighter pilots would kill to fly this thing; it's like it reads your mind..."

</li><li> Genestealers are a weird one. Their genetics are predictable in how a bloodline works and the abilities that are passed down, though the immediate generation after the first don't get any powers. Initially you have a genestealer infect its target. This new host becomes part of the group mind of the genestealers and becomes compelled to mate. The host looks normal, but the offspring will be bald and have slight bit of carapace and more than human speed and strength. This offspring later mates with other half-breeds to produce a full-blooded genestealer complete with 4 razor sharp claws and the ability to infect new hosts like its genestealer grandparent.

Morgan's daughter Pearl <em>does</em> have significant channeling powers, described as a prodigy, but is still outdone by Misty's daughter Maya as of <em>Spirit of Justice</em>. But it could be due to their age difference (10 years), as Pearl was able to channel spirits at will at the tender age of 8, while Maya, 18, could only channel her sister's soul and with a low chance of success.

<ul><li> Ranger has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> like her genetic mother Medic Mouse, but lacks her distinctive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a> and instead developed a suite of more offensively oriented powers such as energy projection and super strength.
</li><li> The second Voltage Vixen is an exception, having succeeded her mother, the first Voltage Vixen.
</li><li> Coriolis (weather control) and Ferric (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a>, literally) are cousins and their great-grandfather looks younger than you'd expect someone exposed to nuclear tests in the 50s. But their other siblings and cousins seem to lack powers.
</li><li> Teragauss's two oldest kids have manifested powers radically different from his own magnetic control. His son Pooka turns intangible and invisible while daughter Merrow is hydrokinetic.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, every descendant of the Fire Nation royal family is an extremely powerful bender or will be one. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2th7j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2th7j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2th7j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Zukos daughter Firelord Izumi hasnt been confirmed to be a bender nor has her unnamed daughter </span>Bending is stated to generally run in family lines, but there are also plenty of examples of benders whose parents never had the ability and children born of benders who don't inherit it.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, Aang (Avatar/Air Nomad) and Katara (Waterbender) have three kids: Kya (Waterbender), Bumi (Non-Bender <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who gains airbending from Harmonic Convergence later</span>), and Tenzin (Airbender). Tenzin and his wife, Pema (Non-bender), have 4 children. All of them but the youngest are Airbenders, with the youngest being predicted to be another Airbender.
</li><li> To add to the confusion, there was also an episode with a pair of identical twins where one was an earthbender and the other was just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a>. The other set of identical twins in the franchise, Toph's grandsons Wei and Wing, are both earthbenders.
</li><li> Mako and Bolin are brothers, and both benders, with one an Earthbender and the other a Firebender. This is the same distribution as their parents' races, with their father from the Earth Kingdom and their mother from the Fire Nation.
</li><li> Advanced bending talents, such as metalbending, also appear to be genetic. Toph created the talent, but both of her daughters and three of her five grandchildren are also metalbenders, with the remaining two being a non-bender and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">post-Convergence, an airbender</span>; in-series, the probability of an earthbender having the knack for metalbending is one in a hundred, meaning that if it's <em>not</em> genetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Toph could have made an absolute fortune betting on ostrich horse races</a>. Meanwhile, exiled crime boss Yakone, even after Aang removes his bending, supposedly passes his gift for bloodbending at times other than the full moon to his children, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tarrlok and Noatak/Amon</span>, but since he trains them it could just be his tutelage rather than an intrinsic talent. And <em>nobody</em> knows what's up with lavabending; apart from a few Avatars, only Ghazan and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bolin</span> use it, neither of them have any kids in the series, and whether <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bolin</span> being half-Fire Nation was a factor is never brought up because Ghazan's pre-Red Lotus backstory is a mystery.
</li><li> The three Avatars whose parents we really know anything about all had two bending parents as well. Kyoshis dad was an Earth Bender and her mom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixedAncestry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixedAncestry">was a renegade Air Bender</a>. Aang never knew his parents but they were both benders. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, all Air Nomads were benders due to their spiritual enlightenment which was later made canon by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiseOfKyoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiseOfKyoshi">The Rise of Kyoshi</a></em>. Korras parents were both seen Water Bending in her show.
</li><li> Bending is actually a combination of genetic and spiritual factors. Which element you can bend is genetic (if all your family have been firebenders, you're not going to be able to earthbend), but the ability to access that bending is spiritual. So theoretically, a long line of racially mixed non-benders could unexpectedly produce a child who could bend any element. The only limitation would be that no one but the Avatar can bend more than one. So in the case of identical twins, it would be a personality difference preventing one from bending.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDragonJakeLong">American Dragon: Jake Long</a></em>, the gene that gives you dragon powers is apparently recessive as it skips a generation. This means Jake, his sister, and his grandpa all have dragon powers while his mother doesn't.
<ul><li> The most probable explanation is that males <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_imprinting">imprint the gene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (turn it off before passing it along in a gamete). Jake and Haley were both lucky enough (25% chance of both inheriting it) to inherit the gene and since it came from their mother the gene was turned back on before being passed along.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> plays this to a lesser extreme: the eponymous character's father was a rocket scientist, her mother was a brain surgeon, her grandmother was a kung-fuing underwater-demolitioning aviatrix, her brothers are practically miniature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">mad scientists</a>, so Kim Possible would be a world-saving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheFu">She-Fu</a> cheerleader.
<div class="indent"><strong>Kim</strong>: I guess my genetics rock.

The season 2 episode "Baby Cakes" confirmed when earth ponies Mr. and Mrs. Cake have twins who are a pegasus and a unicorn, which Mr. Cake explains by saying that he has unicorn ancestry, and Mrs. Cake has pegasus ancestry. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">"That makes sense, right?"</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMouse">Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures</a></em> uses this in "The Bride of Mighty Mouse", which depicts an alternate future where Mighty Mouse and Pearl Pureheart are married and have an infant son who inherits his dad's powers.
