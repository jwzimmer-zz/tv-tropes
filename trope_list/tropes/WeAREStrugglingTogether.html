<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, one of the major problems that the Survey Corp has with the royal government is that they don't know <em>why</em> the government is doing anything. Why suppress technology? Why hide knowledge of the Titans and the world before the Walls? They could be doing it all for the good of humanity, or they could just be desperately trying to retain their own power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In chapter 61, Commander Pixis fakes a report saying that the next Wall has fallen in order to gauge the council's reactions. When they immediately order the gates sealed and half of humanity sacrificed to save themselves, he decides that they don't deserve to lead</span>.
<ul><li> The next arc throws a gut punch to the readers by showing just how divisive and corrupting a conflict of values can be when it applies to the overpowered main characters; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren decides he wants to destroy the concept of slavery, even if it means mass-genocide of slave races (which includes <em>all</em> of his friends) and most of human civilization.

This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth In Web Manga</a>. Other historical examples are also mentioned, including the political fracturing of Italy and the decline of the (neither)Holy (nor)Roman (nor)Empire.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoardingSchoolJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoardingSchoolJuliet">Boarding School Juliet</a></em>, the White Cats are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun">catty</a>, politicking mess of factions only barely organized around a monarchy...but they know who their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarJustBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarJustBefore">real</a> enemies are.

</li><li> It's even mentioned as being part of the Kyoto Group (the main benefactor for all the Japanese rebellion factions) main motivation for funding so many groups. Lelouch forces them to pledge their complete allegiance to him, by which anything other than minor resistance factions have been rolled into the Black Knights.
</li></ul></li><li> In the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Freezing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Freezing">Freezing</a></em>, the world is being invaded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>, and yet most of mankind's hopes are more interested in rankings and beating the crap out of each other. Well, that's what you get when the fate of the world is in the hand of temperamental teenage girls.
</li><li> All of the military factions (Mustang, Grumman and General Armstrong at least) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> agree that King Bradley needs to be 'dethroned' and seem to understand that part of each other- yet when it all comes down to it the cooperation starts to disintegrate into 'who-will-get-the-big-seat-afterward' plotting rather than standing as a more united front.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, there are several important factions. One, Negi's group. Two, Cosmo Entelechia. Three, Megalomesembria politicians led by Kurt Godel. Mahora academy seems to be involved to some extent. The goal: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">save everyone possible when the magic world collapses</span>. Negi and Fate are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Archenemy">archenemies</a>, Negi thinks Kurt is too practical (and Kurt thinks Negi is foolishly idealistic) and Fate's group just wiped out most of the military as part of their plan to "help". And it's not clear what Mahora is doing, but they definitely disapprove of Fate's destruction of the gates. It's getting to the point that Negi and Fate are only fighting about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who can do a better job of saving the world</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>, about the only thing Katsura and Takasugi seem to agree on is that the current government has to go. While the extremist Takasugi is cutting deals with intergalactic crime syndicates or mass producing weaponry, Katsura's plans typically involve something petty like secretly flipping all the Shinsengumi's toilet paper rolls upside down.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV">OAV</a> 'Seven Days of Fire' starts off with a rebellion against the maintenance chief over privileges (basically, fishing and girly magazines). Within days, there are literally dozens of splinter groups, each with its own agenda (some pro-chief), soon resorting to violence (with paper fans — this is Japan). Director Mamoru Oshii hung around a lot of radical student groups during his college days; one gets the impression that he wasn't left with a very high opinion of radicalism.
</li><li> Early episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersHeadmasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersHeadmasters">Transformers: The★Headmasters</a></em> had elements of this trope between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolTrain">Trainbots</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Headmasters</a>, until they had to team up to save Japan from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Sixshot</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread">Vandread</a></em>, the various factions/groups that the crew of the Nirvana come to assist them in the final episodes of Season 2, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s fleet shows up. Prior to this, they were either being harvested by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, or were at odds with each other.

</li><li> In Bolivia, the Bolivian Communist Party outright refuses to support Che Guevara's call for an armed struggle, saying that the time is not right and they need to build a political base first. Che suspects that this is an excuse, and that the the Soviet Union, who by this point regarded Che as a rogue agent, ordered the Communist Party not to help. Che and his band end up fighting the government of René Barrientos alone.

The biggest problem the titular general has turns out not to be the invading Americans, but his fellow generals and his president's cabinet who are far more interested in securing their personal or business interests rather than defending their country. Too often, he goes and finds them either idle and abed with a woman or celebrating a local feast when the Americans are on the advance. For their part, the Americans are rather amazed at how much discord there is in the Filipino ranks to the point that they laugh themselves silly when they learn that General Luna was killed by his own allies for reasons unrelated to the war.
<ul><li> This continues into the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoyoAngBatangHeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoyoAngBatangHeneral">Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral</a></em>, with what's left of Luna's friends and allies butting heads with Aguinaldo's loyalists. For example, Aguinaldo and Del Pilar surround the house of Jose Alejandrino with troopers prior to a talk where they desperately need to secure his cooperation. He makes them wait anyway and, after the talk, demands answers about the circumstances of Antonio Luna's death.

While everyone agrees that everyone needs to work together in order to win the imminent Last Battle, most factions are also of the opinion that this needs to happen by them conquering the world. For instance, the Seanchan follow mostly the same prophecy everyone follows — but their version disagrees with everyone else's, maybe by as little as one sentence out of an entire book, so they believe they need to subdue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChosenOne">Dragon Reborn</a> in order to have a chance of winning. The Dragon Reborn controls about half the continent, which required forcibly overcoming many struggling factions, embodying this trope right there. The outcome is predictable. Others such as various Aes Sedai factions see the need to cooperate, but only so long as they control everything behind the scenes (even if it means they have to <em>kidnap and abuse the Chosen One</em>.)

However, to quote the novel itself, "the Underground wasn't a political party. What's more, it wasn't even a front of political parties". Its members couldn't even agree as to whether or not the mind control has to go. Factions range from blatant fascists (who want to overthrow the government and keep the mind control towers) to "biologists" (who just want to destroy the towers, but don't mind keeping the government — so they can't even agree about that), and there are factions within factions as well. It is explicitly pointed out that many prominent Underground leaders are either agents or secret allies of the government. The protagonist ultimately doesn't even bother trying to rally them, instead striking a deal with one of the less secure government leaders for inside information, recruiting a few of the more sensible Underground members and blowing up the mind control center without consulting anybody else. It is implied in later Noonverse novels that he and his allies then had to put down rebellions by some of the other groups, even though the country was already a terrible mess by then due to mind control withdrawal and such. It also doesn't help that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the protagonist destroying the towers also ruined the efforts of human agents to gradually improve the situation on the planet.

Most of this can be blamed on Borsk Fey'lya and his attempts to gain power, but he's not alone. Garm Bel Iblis, after Bail Organa's death, had actually split off and formed his own rebellion against the Empire, since he thought Mon Mothma was becoming too authoritarian.

</li><li> While the Alethi Highprinces don't fight each other on the Shattered Plains (where they are all camped, and which has become the <em>de facto</em> center of the kingdom), back home their armies still fight each other over land, uniting only when foreigners try to invade.

<ul><li> First and foremost, we have Dalinar, the only one trying to fight honorably and unite everyone against the coming darkness. Sadeas spends the entire book undermining him every single way he can.

Understandably, all the districts despise the Capitol for what they do to them and their children... However, the Hunger Games became so ritualistic that the districts are more preoccupied with training their chosen children so that one of them can survive and beat the kids from the rivaling districts, rather than trying to overthrow the Capitol and end the oppression once and for all.

Stannis attempts to ally with his younger brother Renly, accurately citing that he (Stannis) has the proper claim anyway. Renly essentially replies "no one wants you as a king (including yourself), <em>I</em> do want to be king and am popular enough to do it, and I have the biggest army." Robb Stark tries to make alliances with both Stannis and Renly, and even Balon Greyjoy, but Stannis sees Robb declaring Northern independence as treason, Robb himself won't give up his own crown, and Balon sneak attacks the North due to a (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed">misplaced</a>) grudge he had against Robb's dead father. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All of which allows the Lannisters to win</span>.

Air Marshal Harris, the head of Bomber Command, meets with the Army commander, General Roberts. The meeting concludes with Harris reluctantly agreeing to provide 150 planes. Later, Roberts finds out from his own commanders, Admiral Mountbatten and Captain Hughes-Hallett, that the Air Force has gone on record as refusing to provide the aircraft because, in Harris's words, the Army stated they weren't necessary. Mountbatten angrily confronts a confused Roberts and demands to know what was said during his meeting with Air Marshal Harris:

Normally, the teamwork tasks make it clear that the teams are supposed to work together to complete the task, but in one such task in Series Four the teams were each given individual tasks relating to a bath (one was assigned the task of filling it with as many objects as possible, another to cover it with clingfilm and, in the case of the three-member team, the third was asked to fill it with water) without, initially, telling the other members of the team what their task was. Unfortunately, one team failed to realise it was still a team task and events degenerated into absolute chaos, with at least two members ending up not just undoing but outright <em>sabotaging</em> their fellow team mate's efforts while the third simply watched without lifting a finger to intervene. Conversely, after some initial confusion the other team quickly realised they were supposed to complete all tasks, with one member helping the other after he'd completed his part. Unsurprisingly, the cooperative team did better than the in-fighting team.

</li><li> He also asserts that after Britain failed to break up the EEC from the outside, they resorted to joining it, as from the inside "We can make a complete dog's breakfast of the whole thing. We have now set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch... and the Foreign Office is terribly happy. It's just like old times."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackSails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackSails">Black Sails</a></em> is practically <em>built</em> on this trope. The pirates want two things: treasure and control of Nassau, but the endless in-fighting among themselves as to how they procure and <em>keep</em> these things means they never manage to hold onto them for very long. A prime example occurs in season four: to regain control of the island, the pirates decide to free all the slaves living in the interior. But in a bid to preempt the slaves defecting to the pirates, the estate managers have already separated the slave families and decreed that if any one estate revolts, family members will be punished elsewhere. This leads to a disagreement between Flint and Billy: whether to retreat from a single estate so as to keep the trust of their would-be allies, or to forcibly free and enlist them despite the reprisals that would be visited upon their families. A fight breaks out, and by the time everything is under control, the slaves have formed their <em>own</em> uprising, one that doesn't want anything to do with Nassau's legal residents <strong>or</strong> the pirates.

<ul><li> The Scarlet Empress actually encouraged this infighting among her subordinate governing and administrating organizations, so that they would be unable to effectively overthrow her and have the less-than-instant decision-making process of a multi-person body give the enemies of Creation time to re-invade. Which was all well and good, until she disappeared...
</li><li> Which is the smallest cast on the trope in the setting. On a grander scale, Creation, the normal world that is, has at least three whole groups of mortal enemies roughly as strong as itself, bent on its destruction; that is, Old Unseated Gods, Old Dead Gods (who, being dead but unable to cease to exist, just wish for everything to cease to exist so they can as well) and Mutating Energies Of Aether. Creation would be surely doomed if only those three forces wouldn't hate each other with roughly the same passion and fight on every opportunity, because their image of what <em>should</em> be are so different. Only two times in history have two of those forces seriously joined an effort against Creation, and both times they did landed a mighty blow. Ironically, the first attempt still in many parts failed because of poor coordination. (Mutating Energies attacked lands struck with super-Plague engineered by Dead Gods; they really should have made sure all of Creation's defenses were down...)
</li><li> As for the defenders of Creation, they're not even pretending to be on the same side. Broadly, the Dragon-Blooded are the ruling power of Creation, and by and large most of them are as interested in plundering the riches of their vassals as they are in guarding Creation.

And then the returning Solar Exalted...no. There is no "the Solar Exalted," there are about a hundred and fifty individuals who are reincarnated heroes of the First Age with the power to reshape the world, all of whom are either developing their own agendas, becoming pawns in someone else's agenda, or just trying to survive (and "surviving," for a Solar, tends to wreck a <em>lot</em> of people's plans).

The various Service Groups are meant to be all on the same side, yet are likely to spend more time getting in each other's way rather than serving the Computer, and Communists play into the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian">People's Front Of Judea/Judean People's Front</a> archetype at the best of times. Not to mention the First Church of Christ Computer Programmer, which is otherwise basically just a bunch of Computer loyalists.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> The wildly assorted powers of Chaos regard the destruction of the Imperium of Man as one of their main goals, especially the Night Lords and Iron Warriors legions, but as one might expect of Chaos, they are, well, chaotic, and spend as much time fighting each other and anyone who happens to be nearby as working against the Imperium.
</li><li> The Imperium, meanwhile, considers the destruction of everything that is not the Imperium to be its main goal. Precisely how this should be achieved is a matter of dispute between the Astartes, the Imperial Guard, the Sororitas, the Inquisition, the Adeptus Mechanicus, the Ecclesiarchy, and so on — and that's before you get to the divides in individual factions. Fortunately (for them) most of the Imperium don't think these divides take precedence over killing the nearest alien/heretic/mutant.
</li><li> Mix in divides within the divides within those factions. i.e. the Inquisition is split into multiple branches and each of those branches ends up arguing both with each other; and individual Inquisitors within those branches tend to argue with each other as well (along such lines as radicalism vs orthodoxy and so on). All in all it gets rather messy.
</li><li> The Imperium <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">intentionally invokes this</a>. All organizations and individuals are taught to foster an inherent distrust of each other, and the command structure is designed to be as loose as possible while retaining some level of cohesion. On one hand, this makes the Imperium a bureaucrat's worst nightmare, and allocations of military and humanitarian aid are haphazard at the best of times. On the other, this means that the Imperium is ironically <em>less</em> vulnerable to inside threats, as if not a single high-ranking official with his own agenda could be a huge problem. This is the same reason why Imperial Guard regiments are often incredibly specialized and Imperial Navy fleets aren't allowed to carry troops that would be useful in land battles. As for what reason that <em>is</em>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Well, let's just say it was a harsh lesson learned long ago</a>.
</li><li> Also the defining quality of the Orks; they like to talk about Da Orks iz gonna tak ova', but are constantly infighting. This is taken to a quite hilarious extreme with the Orks, as the generally accepted view is that if the Orks were ever to stop in-fighting and actually unite they'd probably easily defeat everyone else. However all that is required to stop any Ork force of any size is to take out the Ork in charge of it; the inevitable fight for dominance between subordinate Orks being all but guaranteed to cause the whole enterprise to fall apart. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBeastArises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBeastArises">They did manage to band together as one, just the one time</a>, and they nearly stomped the Imperium (holding Terra itself at gunpoint with a heavily armed <em>moon</em>) until they managed to kill the organizer, at which point things returned to the usual chaos.
</li><li> The Tyrannids subvert this. While different hive fleets will attack and eat each other if they meet on the same planet it doesn't diminish the overall strength of the Tyrannids one bit. The winner simply consume the loser's biomass and uses it to become much stronger. Arguably, the Tyranids are heavily involved in this trope with regard to the other species as well. Given that the Tyranids are believed to be flat out on their way to consume the entire galaxy and everything in it then you'd perhaps expect that at the very least the likes of the Eldar, Tau and the Imperium could see their way clear to putting aside their differences and uniting against the common foe. But this being 40k they tend to be too busy trying to get one over on each other to worry about diversions such as galaxy-devouring swarms.
</li><li> The Craftworld Eldar mostly avert this. Anything less than full unity would mean their quick and horrible deaths. That said, disagreements between Farseers have been known to result in conflict from time to time, as both will be convinced that their path is the one that will lead to future Eldar prosperity.
</li><li> Dark Eldar play it very straight, however. Most Dark Eldar exist in Kabals which are perhaps most simply described as a cross between tribe-like social constructs and paramilitary organizations. Given that the way of advancing in Dark Eldar society is (in most cases) to murder the person above you and take their place the leaders of the Dark Eldar literally can't trust any of their subordinates (who may be plotting against them) and the subordinates can't trust their leaders (as the leaders might kill them off out of fear of a plot). This results in senior Kabal members having to hire independent mercenaries known as Incubi to act as bodyguards against their enemies (i.e. basically everyone else). Dark Eldar society, and life on Commorragh generally, is effectively one long struggle for power and survival where the weak are subjugated and enslaved by the strong and the strong are constantly having to fight to stay at the top. One wonders how they manage to cooperate long enough to successfully pull off any raids at all or, indeed, where they find the energy to do so after all that in-fighting.
</li><li> This is (or, at least, was) totally averted by the Necrons. Being near-mindless automatons under the sway of the C'tan, they existed only to wage war against the living. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">later revealed</a> as more arose that there were actual separate dynasties, lead by individual Necron Lords who were a little bit loopy <em>before</em> going into stasis for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">about sixty or so million years</a>. While the Necron typically devote more time to fighting non-Necron forces than each other, aided by the spread out nature of their dynasties' locales, there's nothing stopping them from warring against their fellows.
</li><li> Even the Tau, ostensibly united as they are under the banner of "The Greater Good", are quite prone to this, especially when two Tau disagree on what the Greater Good actually is and what course of action must be followed to reach it. Most prominently, the breakaway Farsight Enclave faction has routinely engaged in armed conflict with the Empire proper when not under immediate threat from an outside force, but far more sinister examples also exist. Fire Caste armies will clash over petty differences between their Ethereal leaders, or the Water Caste will purposefully undermine their comrades to avoid threatening diplomacy. In once particular case, a famous Shas'O and his bull-headed nature was threatening to reignite warfare between the Tau and the Imperium after long and arduous negotiations by the Water Caste. Rather than risk losing all of their hard work and getting millions of soldiers on both sides killed, the Water Caste conspired with the Imperial Guard to get the Shas'O and his cadre wiped out, cold-blooded betrayal costing the lives of hundreds of their most loyal soldiers was a worthy price to pay for continued peace.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> does this with multiple factions. In addition to the Greenskins and Chaos (who are just as prone to infighting as their futuristic examples above), we have the Empire of Man. Made out of multiple different provinces each ruled by an Elector Count, the Empire is a mass of politicking, backstabbing, deliberate obstruction, and more. The election of an Emperor from among the Counts is often the subject of some contention with at least <em>some</em> of the counts, and the provinces sometimes squabble amongst themselves. The Empire has actually collapsed into civil war on more than one occasion, though against an outside threat they (most of the time) manage to pull together in order to fight it off...before going back to being at one another's throats. This came to a disastrous head in the End Times arc that ended the game, as despite the various races of the setting having to work together in order to stop Chaos from destroying the entire world, multiple different agendas and crises and disagreement on <em>how</em> exactly to save the world resulted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">Chaos claiming victory</a> and opening a Chaos portal that consumed the whole world.</span>

However, when the Chaos Gods launched a concerted attack, Nagash betrayed Sigmar at a crucial moment and cost them the battle, allowing Chaos to invade every Mortal Realm simultaneously, which made the other gods withdraw to their own realms. Part of Sigmar's strategy to reconquer the Mortal Realms from Chaos is to rebuild this alliance, working together to destroy Chaos once and for all.

<ul><li> The Traditions can agree on exactly one thing — they all hate the Technocracy and want it gone. The fact that just about every one of the nine Traditions loathe and despise the other eight <em>may</em> just be a large part of the reason why the Technocracy (which is all about working together for the greater good — well, for a given value of "good," anyway) has been kicking their butt for the last six hundred years...
</li><li> However, by the time of the books, the Traditions have been better at cooperation for quite some time. Apparently, differences in outlook seem smaller when you are on the brink of destruction (they still don't like each other, but they are working together).
</li><li> Also, in their own books, it is shown that the Technocracy isn't half as unified as it looks. The five main groups are constantly politicking, both internally and against the others.

There are thirteen tribes that struggle against each other; they have a combined set of rules called the Litany but all have different ideas on which rules are <em>important</em>; there's also a lot of struggle <em>within</em> most tribes; and the fact that all werewolves are prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">berserk frenzy</a> if mildly provoked doesn't help. As a result, the werewolves have all but annihilated all non-wolf shape-shifters, and completely wiped out one of their own tribes, the Bunyip.

The Clans are also divided into two groups: the Crusaders (led by Jade Falcon) believe it is their right that they should conquer Terra, and the Inner Sphere, while the Wardens (formerly led by Wolf) believe they should be its protectors, not conquerors.
<ul><li> Clan Wolf actually split between the Crusader and Warden factions after the invasion failed, becoming the Wolf Empire and Clan Wolf-In-Exile respectively.
</li><li> There's also a split between the "Home Clans" and "Invader Clans," the Home Clans being the ones who didn't get to participate in the invasion and the Invader Clans being the ones who did. Adding in the Warden/Crusader divide and the individual Clan enmities that go back centuries, and Clan politics gets very messy indeed.
</li><li> The Inner Sphere is all about this once the Clans come knocking. Even a full year into the invasion, the various Successor States find it almost impossible to work together (with the bizarre exception of two of the biggest enemies, the Federated Commonwealth and the Draconis Combine), and almost everyone is hatching some plot to turn the whole thing to their advantage (aside from the afformentioned FedCom and DC leaders, who actually grasp the scale of the Clan threat). And then you have ComStar, who's actually working <em>with</em> the Clans in the hopes that the war will finally allow them to bring their version of peace and enlightenment to the Inner Sphere. And within the individual Successor States, there are elements who just can't see their way clear to working with former enemies.
</li><li> And then within the Sphere, the Free Worlds League might as well adopt this trope as their motto. The League has fought about as many wars among themselves (either scions of the family making a play for the Captain-General's throne, or Andurien rebelling against the League's authority... again...) as they have against their neighbors. And even when they're not actively warring, there are battles between the Captain-General and Parliament, between different states in the League,and then there's Andurien making everyone's life miserable by heel-dragging. The various states have invoked the Home Defense Act (an act that in theory was to make sure that the provinces weren't denuded of troops by Federal demands, but has been used in practice to essentially veto provincial participation in wars they didn't want to be part of) so many times that the League can only reliably count on Federal troops for any given military campaign.

What drives most of the plot is the requirement that independence be approved by all 13 state delegations, and it takes a LOT of dirty, dirty politicking to get enough votes.

<ul><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Foundation</span> council actually splits up into two factions; one faction supports the efforts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Makoto Naegi</a> to reform the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Remnants of Despair</span> enemy agents, while the other faction believes that the enemy agents should be executed.

<ul><li> It's mentioned that one of the biggest problems the demons have in their Eternal Conflict with the angels is that their egos get in the way of them working together, and on at least one occasion an <em>almost</em>-successful invasion of Heaven has fallen apart at the last second because the Lords of Hell started quarrelling amongst themselves before they could secure victory. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Diablo attacks Heaven in the fourth act, he is the Prime Evil, a combination of all seven Lords of Hell in one being, and nearly succeeds in shattering the Crystal Arch, the very pinnacle of Heaven.</span>
</li><li> Also comes up in the <em>Reaper of Souls</em> expansion when a human noble and some peasants try to start a revolution against Westmarch's king at the same time an army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">Reapers</a> are leading an anti-human genocide. Your character suggests humanity should be uniting against the threat posed by the Reapers instead of bickering and killing each other... and is promptly attacked by the rebels, who've decided you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">With Us or Against Us</a>.

In the fifth game, the four allies finally split off, with the humans and servile allying with the Trakovites and the drayks and drakons forming the Ghaldring faction.
</li><li> If we take ambiguously-canon "midquel" <em>Cataclysm</em> as canon, this happened to <em>both sides</em> after the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em>. The death of the Taiidani Emperor and the ensuing power vacuum resulted in a swift descent into out and out civil war ending in the messy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe">Balkanisation</a> of three quarters of his regime's former territory, with the newly-formed Taiidani Republic squaring off against multiple Imperial Loyalist factions -most of whom are implied to hate each other as well- plus a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerRegimePersonnel">Former Regime Personnel</a> who've turned warlord or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirate">Space Pirate</a>.

</li><li> Part and parcel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImperiumNova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImperiumNova">Imperium Nova</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, getting the races to co-operate is the main objective, with even those who are not actually at war with each other proving to be very unhelpful. In the most extreme case, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the quarians have launched their attack on the geth</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">despite the Reapers actually starting their invasion in other parts of the galaxy</a>. Unless Shepard has done literally everything right with regards to both species, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the genocide of one of them is inevitable, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">despite most of the geth having actually wanted peace for the past several centuries--the remainder having sided with the the reaper Sovereign back in the first game, being Shepard's primary enemy back when the quarians were barely surviving on their own</a>.</span>
</li><li> This trope is also very much in evidence with the Illusive Man, who both averts it and plays it straight. The aversion happens during his first in-game appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, wherein he orchestrates the rescue and recovery of Commander Shepard and forms an alliance with them to combat the Collectors, who are in fact slaves of the Reapers. However, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, he plays it painfully straight as Cerberus spends a lot of effort and resources openly opposing the Alliance and Council rather than joining them, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> partially explained by his being indoctrinated,</span> (the DLC Prothean character, Javik, says that this happened during his cycle too, suggesting that divide and conquer is one of the Reapers main tactics).
</li><li> In fact, one of the few powerful characters who <em>does</em> recognize that personal goals need to be put on hold for now is the ruthless crime lord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Aria T'Loak</a>, who gives Shepard useful advice and prioritizes the overall war effort above her own short-term gains. Furthermore, thanks to starring in the <em>Omega</em> DLC, she actually <em>gets</em> what she wants as well as helping the war effort.
</li><li> It's easy to ignore the Salarian threats about curing the genophage, since they quickly come crawling back when they realize the Reapers are threatening them. Depending on your actions in previous games, <em>most of the Salarian military</em> (and potentially their own <em>Council Representative</em>) will basically give the finger to their government and rally themselves behind you.

One of the soldiers guarding your war room even comments on it, saying that humanity would say the same thing if the positions were reversed. Why should other races risk their worlds falling to save Earth (which has already fallen)?

If two party members get into a fight over things like jealousy over a party member showing more affection towards a third person, petty fights in the middle of missions, using abilities that aren't pleasant on other party members (such as the Tank using them as a human cannonball or the chef using them as improvised flamethrowers via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireBreathingDiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireBreathingDiner">Fire-Breathing Diner</a>) or some negative character traits (laid-back Miis hiding behind another Mii to avoid damage or stubborn Miis refusing healing), lead to infighting, causing things like characters sulking, which reduce their attack, healers having less effect on the offending party or both characters getting into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBallOfViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBallOfViolence">Big Ball of Violence</a> which damages a random enemy, but also causes some damage to the involved Miis.

There's also a fourth faction, the Githzerai, who refuse to involve themselves in the war, because the Githyanki hate them even more than the King of shadows, and would put their conflict with the King on hold in order to wage war against the Githzerai, allowing the King to grow in power unopposed.

The Marauders have been for the last fifty years or so killing anyone they see, whether EDF or civilian. It can't end well.

You'll usually see a bunch of Christian or Muslim armies rushing off to get some Piety points by participating in a holy war, but unless two nations are explicitly allied, their armies won't support each other in battle. So it's not uncommon to see a pile-up of Catholic or Muslim armies around the targeted city, which would stand no chance of repelling them if they all attacked together, but instead each force will wait its turn to be the one to try to claim all the glory for itself. And if some of those armies belong to factions that are at war with each other as well, you may be treated to the spectacle of a bunch of religious zealots ostensibly on the same side tearing into each other.

</li><li> This is the main theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tyranny">Tyranny</a></em>: Even though the evil overlord has successfully conquered the world, there are now job openings for governors and mayors of the multiple conquered districts, and all the former generals are throwing their armies at each other trying to grab these claims. Meanwhile, the forces of 'good' suffer from this problem even more because their deep-seated grudges have left them isolated enough for the overlord's armies to bulldoze through. You play as a commissar who was sent to deliver a message to the two overlord armies (one is Viking Nazis and the other is Wasteland Bandits) that are infighting over the last disputed district: work together and get the job done, or the Overlord will use their limit break to destroy the district, killing both armies and the last of the resistance. They don't. It's up to YOU to be the tyrant, pick a side, and unify them properly, or everyone dies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Or you could take a Third Option and join the Rebels. When your boss later calls on you to explain yourself, you can cite this trope for justification... and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeinAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeinAudacity">IT ACTUALLY WORKS</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldofWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldofWarcraft">Wrath of the Lich King</a></em>, the Horde and Alliance agree on one thing: We need to destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lich King</a>. That doesn't stop them from insulting each other, stealing supplies from each other, and it certainly doesn't stop the war that they have been fighting. They even manage to restart their own war while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IgnoredEnemy">The Scourge</a> is still up there trying to wipe them out. If not for the Ashen Verdict, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">comprised</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Death</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Knights</a> and the Argent Crusade, you would be dead. That's right, you're killing your allies, while the Ashen Verdict is saving the world and actually doing what you guys came up here to do in the first place. And the moment the Lich King bites it the war becomes more prevalent. Even the giant dragon ripping out from the core of Azeroth while setting half of the land on fire isn't going to stop them.
</li><li> Averted for the most part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em>; the Council is made up of most of the G20 countries and a few others that give you money and support to keep everyone alive, but will bail if their country's panic level gets too high and they have to focus on keeping the peace. However, several lesser factions continue their infighting despite the full-scale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">Alien Invasion</a> over their heads, as you learn from Zhang in the <em>Slingshot</em> DLC who defects to XCOM over the Triads squabbling for money and power. <em>Enemy Within</em> introduced EXALT, who wanted to use the alien technology to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">does nothing to stop the aliens from doing the exact same thing and sabotages XCOM while they're trying to stop them</a>.

Three other groups pose a serious threat to the alien occupation, but as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Bradford</a> puts it, "together they'd make one hell of a fighting force — too bad they hate each other."

Making contact with each group, building their trust through joint missions, and incorporating them into XCOM is a large part of the game's strategic layer. On the aliens' side, the titular Chosen are competing with each other for the glory of being the one to recapture XCOM's Commander for the Elders and be granted rulership over Earth once the aliens' plans are fulfilled. A lot of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBanter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBanter">Boss Banter</a> consists of digs against each other, and it takes the "Honor Among Thieves" Dark Event for the Chosen to actually share the intelligence they accumulate in their campaigns to track down XCOM's base of operations.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Digger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Digger">Digger</a></em> summarizes the trope nicely:

Each plan has exactly one person who is completely behind it...and beyond that it gets very fuzzy, with most of the other characters either being doubtful of any of the plans' chances or outright apathetic to the whole thing. Mix in interpersonal drama, hot-tempered teenagers, and an <em>extremely</em> complex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron">relationship situation</a> and "opposition to Lord English" doesn't look so much like a side as a hot mess. The tension reaches a head when Vriska and Meenah end up coming to blows rather dramatically over nothing more than getting on each others' nerves.
</li><li> Making matters worse, there is one side against Lord English which plans on conquering everything and ruling with an iron fist afterwards. All the other anti-Lord English sides are <em>also</em> at odds with one another to the point of coming to blows about how to deal with <em>that</em> problem.

<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Reds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Reds">Reds!</a></em>; the socialist revolution in the United States in the 1930s proves to have sufficient ideological flexibility to enable opposing points of view to be heard (both among competing left-wing ideologies and more conservative voices that nevertheless oppose the military junta they're all fighting against) while still ensuring an overall socialist victory, and ultimately proves more successful in this regard than the rigid ideological inflexibility of the Soviet Union. The relationship between the Soviet Union and America following this, however, plays the trope straight, since they ultimately split due to ideological differences and spend as much time plotting against each other as their capitalist enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/TwitchPlaysPokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/TwitchPlaysPokemon">Twitch Plays Pokémon</a></em> is essentially tens of thousands of people simultaneously attempting to button mash their way through a single copy of <em>Pokemon: Red</em>. There is several subgroups fighting each other because of personal interests, like having a Vaporeon or a Lapras, but ultimately, everyone, after fighting themselves over those things, collaborate on the greater goal of finishing the game. Even if they don't know what the next step is, as long as someone comes with a clear and straightforward next step, they will struggle together.

<ul><li> The Great Recovery Coalition was formed by President Floyd Olson by uniting his Progressive Party with the Socialists and the Commonwealth Party, in order to overcome the Great Depression. However, under his successor Fiorello LaGuardia it falls apart — first off, the Socialists and more radical Progressives are infuriated by LaGuardia making the "corrupt bargain" of agreeing to cut off excessive federal spending to Socialist-run California in exchange for the Republicans agreeing to support a universal healthcare bill, and they break away from LaGuardia's more moderate wing of the party. Meanwhile, LaGuardia engages in a power struggle with Commonwealth leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">Huey Long</a>, causing that party to spin off in its own agenda.
</li><li> The Republicans have their own internal problems as well. On the one hand, there's fiscal conservatives like Robert Taft and Herbert Hoover who despise the welfare state that the GRC set up. On the other, there's more liberal-moderate members like Alf Landon and Franklin D. Roosevelt who realize that it's not going away any time soon and should be accepted.
</li><li> When civil rights legislation starts getting pushed through Congress in the 40s, the Commonwealth starts splitting between racial moderates willing to settle for heavily amending the Civil Rights Act so that it's barely effective, and hardliners who want to block the bill altogether.
</li><li> It's noted that Gandhi's calm and peaceful leadership is the only thing keeping the Indian independence movement from breaking apart due to infighting between the Communist wing and the various religious/nationalist groups.
