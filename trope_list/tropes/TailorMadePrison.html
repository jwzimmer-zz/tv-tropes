</p><p>The purpose of the Tailor-Made Prison in a story is usually one to give a villain street cred: they must be <em>really</em> bad to merit it. Also, a previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> can be considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommutingOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommutingOnABus">Commuting on a Bus</a> when in the prison.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> had the Diclonii in underground research facilities, for lack of a better term, trapped in meters thick full body casings much like Iron Maidens, being fed through IV tubes, with a perimeter marking that no one was allowed in lest their hands get to them. The only reason that any of them got out is because either a) someone stupidly dropped a PEN inside of the circle or b) they were let out to take care of the Diclonius released in a)
</li><li> Lab 5 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> combines this with a sort of "Area 51" kind of place. It is guarded by living suits of armor containing the souls of serial killers believed by the public to have been executed, as well as fierce chimeras. One prisoner in all versions is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">Mad Bomber</a> Zolf Kimblee who has his hands in "minature stocks" which prevent him from using his powers. In the first anime, the homonculus Greed was imprisoned there for about two centuries until a fortuitous explosion frees him. At this point, the lab takes on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">Cardboard Prison</a> qualities, as he proceeds to free the other prisoners. It was custom-designed to hold alchemists, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Homunculi</a>, after all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em>, the defeated and captured members of Yami (an organization of villainous martial arts masters) are sent into one of the series of so-called "Big Locks" - massively built prisons designed specifically to keep the Yami members inside for good. But it's later revealed that this trope is subverted. The prisoners are fully capable of just walking out of the prison. The only reason they stay there is because of their pride as martial artists, which dictates that they must obey the winner's orders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">All For One's</a> cell in the Tartaros prison has him restrained in a chamber full of weapons that will fire on him all at once if he so much tries to use his Quirk.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> it seems to be standard practice to create prisons made entirely out of seastone, which is not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium">indestructible</a> but also serves as the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">Kryptonite Factor</a> for Devil Fruit users.
<ul><li> Impel Down serves as this; the World Government puts some criminals down in Level Six, and everyone is supposed to forget that they ever existed. In fact, most people don't even know that Level Six itself exists, including most of the prison's inmates, thinking that it stops at Level 5.

</li><li> The very first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> movie featured Kain, an amorphous evil entity which broke out of his subspace prison at Galactic Police Headquarters and then escaped into the past to try and kill Tenchi's mother.

He was fed a nutritional paste (nothing solid, since he could even use a solid bowel movement as a deadly weapon) that was piped in a bowl that was set in the floor. He eventually escaped by slamming his head into a wall until he broke off a tooth and then feigned unconsciousness, using the tooth fragment to kill the guard who came to check on him.

<ul><li> Carl Draper, at times The Master Jailer, or Deathtrap, was originally the architect of a tailor-made prison for Superman's convicted criminal enemies, who could not be kept in in a standard prison. The prisoner's own powers were used to keep each other locked up. This fell apart when Draper got mad that no one -not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang">Lana Lang</a>, who he was obsessed with- acknowledged his work, and he became a threat to Superman - ironically the only person who gave him credit for his work and skill- and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>.

He built the prison when Superman challenged him to create a prison that even he couldn't break out of.

When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flashes</a> drew him into the Speed Force, he was kept in a place with only red sunlight until he was able to build a set of armor that converted it into yellow sunlight. When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/InfiniteCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/InfiniteCrisis">Infinite Crisis</a></em> ended, the Guardians Of The Universe locked him in a special Sciencell inside a red Sun Eater, which was itself guarded at all times by fifty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lanterns</a>. Then after he was rescued by the Sinestro Corp and landed in the future, he was sent back to Earth Prime. This was maybe the most hellish prison of all, since he got what he wanted and was sent home, only to find his parents knew everything he'd done and he was hated and unloved by everyone, unable to get back to the comic book world - not that he wanted to. When he finally <em>did</em> get drawn back, he tried to kill Conner Kent and ended up imprisoned in the Source Wall for his trouble.
</li><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewKrypton">New Krypton</a></em> arc, Lex Luthor designed all kind of tailor-made prisons for Kryptonians.

For example, the crazed serial killer Zsasz is permanently restrained due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> psyche, Poison Ivy is kept in a glass prison with no space for her to control plants to break herself out, and Mr. Freeze is given a modified meat locker for his cold body. Not that any of these ever stop the more unpredictable criminals like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> from breaking out at will more easily than the power specific villains.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>: Reed Richards once tried to end the threat of Doctor Doom for good by trapping <em>both</em> of them in a Tailor-Made Prison; this being the only way he could be sure Doom would never escape. The team discovered Reed's sacrificial plan in time to rescue him, but Doom got out too. Note that Reed only trapped Doom inside of that prison because he didn't think <em>Hell</em> would be secure enough, and he was right. Doom <em>has</em> been known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapedFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapedFromHell">to escape from Hell.</a>

</li><li> Also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueofAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueofAmerica">Justice League</a></em>, the Queen of Fables was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorceress">Evil Sorceress</a> who had formerly been trapped in a book of fairy tales, and could reshape reality to her whims using the same tales and other imaginative fantasy, turning Manhattan into an enchanted forest and cursing Wonder Woman with a thousand-year slumber. Wonder Woman recovered, however, and did away with the Queen by trapping her in a very different book, the U.S. Tax Code, where she'd never find anything to use as a weapon.
</li><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em>, The Corrosive Man was sealed away in a special room that constantly sprayed him with material that suppressed his acidic abilities. He ended up covering his hand long enough to allow him to use his powers and escaped.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, the only way to imprison The Absorbing Man, a supervillain whose body becomes any form of matter he touches, at one time was to put him in a cardboard box and put it in a prison cell since he would otherwise become the materials of the cell (like stone and steel) and smash his way out. Unfortunately, there was eventually a water leak that dripped on the box, allowing him to change into water, move to the cell floor, change into stone and break free.

The arc ends 130 years <em>after</em> the films. Morne survives the first nearly-4,000 years thanks to the Tailor-Made Prison of Lord Dreypa, which works as basically an indestructible Bag-of-Holding version of this trope. How does she get out?

</li></ul></li><li> In the Crimson Dawn arc of the X-Men comics, Psylocke is forced to concentrate all her telepathic power on the Shadow King (an extremely powerful and malevolent psychic entity which feeds on the hatred of humanity) in order to keep him permanently trapped in the Astral Plane.
</li><li> Some time later, after the Shadow King escapes and comes looking for vengeance, Psylocke ends up trapping him inside a mutant that eats psychic energy. Because she'd already lobotomized said mutant, there's no way for the Shadow King to get out again.

</li><li> Almost every comic book has some sort of "super villain" prison where they set up specific cells to confine the villain depending on his abilities. The Sinister Six from various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> incarnations are usually confined in this way.

Not only is it nearly impossible for the villains inside to escape, but even if they do, they're still in <em>the Negative Zone</em> with no easy way home.
</li><li> An older one is the Cube, literally a giant cube-shaped prison in the middle of the desert. It was intended to hold superpowered supervillains, especially those possessing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>.
</li><li> The Vault was <em>designed</em> as a Tailor-Made Prison by the government to hold super-villains, but it turned out largely ineffective, becoming more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">Cardboard Prison</a>. Fortunately, the government eventually realized its flaws, and shut it down, which led to smaller, more efficient facilities being designed.

Due to the nature of its construction, there are only two ways in or out: one is through Niflheim/Helheim, which as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnderworld">a Realm of the Dead</a> siphons life and power off spirits in particular - something Surtur, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeing">Energy Being</a>, is particularly vulnerable to. The other, the only real flaw in the entire prison, is through a relatively small crack in Nidavaellir, which is covered by the Seal of Muspelheim. Despite numerous escape attempts, and Surtur's most powerful servants, the Great Captains, remaining at large, it's held for over a million years. Unfortunately, the events of Book 1 lead to the Seal being cracked, and a lot of Book 2 is spent trying to prevent it from cracking further (or at least, not until everyone's prepared to deal with the consequences).

Not only are the prisoners stripped of their Cuties Marks, but hey are also shackled with limiter collars (which keeps non-pony criminals in line as well). The prison itself is also practically inescapable, and trying to flee is a death sentence for Black Collars (who are on the death penalty anyway), as the Dazzlings who patrol the moat are allowed to eat the black collars if they ever try to. Any other color prisoners are immediately hypnotized by their songs and sent back to the prison. Past the moat is an entire forest full of plunder vines that will capture and ensnare prisoners (or rather anyone not wearing Royal Guard Armor) the moment they get too close, draining their magic and leaving them easy to capture when the guards make their rounds. Being a pegasus (or any flying creature) makes no difference since there are spiked clouds in the prison's airspace that are enchanted to gravitate towards prisoners, ensnaring them before shocking them into unconsciousness.

So the gods turn his sons into wolves ripping each other's guts out and tie him up with said guts, entomb him in an isolated cave beneath the world, and place a snake over his head that constantly drips venom into his eyes to keep him distracted. He is sprung by his children on the eve of Ragnarok. His monstrous children that is - not his humanoid children, whose intestines bind him.
<ul><li> Fenris Wolf, Loki's monster son, was imprisoned with a specially crafted, unbreakable, ribbon-like chain, made from women's beards, cat's footfalls, bear's sinews, the roots of mountains, fish's breath and bird's spit. The reason that these things can't be found anymore is because the dwarves had to use them all up to create the chain.

<ul><li> As appropriate to this trope, the Yozis have struggled for Ages to free themselves from their prison. Their most recent attempt was the creation of the Infernal Exalted, though it remains to be seen whether this plan will work any better than their previous ones.
</li><li> While this trope applies to all the Yozi to some extent, Oramus, the Dragon Beyond the World has an even more extreme example. With nigh-omnipotent control over the concept of Boundaries (physical and abstract), the gods and Exalted feared that any binding, no matter how clever, wouldn't be enough to lock him away permanently. Thus, in addition to the surrender oaths and being placed in Malfeas, they also fashioned him into his own prison, breaking his seven wings into restraints that he couldn't simply ignore or command.

<ul><li> The so-called Trap Books featured prominently in the game also might count. They work like Linking Books; however, due to a slight alteration, they link to a non-space between universes where a person can end up trapped forever, unable to move or interact with anything, their only view of the outside world being the panel they touched, and only if the book is open. A Trap Book only holds one, however, and if another person touches the panel while the book is occupied, the two switch places.

In the second (and larger) fortress, a number of usually inescapable prison chambers are found above, usually with some bones in them.

You can also get trapped in your own Maze and attempt to find your way out.

Most of those shown are used by the Fire Nation:
<ul><li> The Boiling Rock, which includes firebenders, uses special "cooling cells" to imprison rowdy firebenders. The cells were so cold they couldn't muster up the heat to firebend. Zuko used his fire breathing to keep warm and remove the fastening bolts from the inside.
</li><li> Waterbenders were likewise kept suspended in metal cages far from the ground and water, as well as having hot, dry air pumped in. When they were given water, their arms and legs were fastened. Hama got out by learning to manipulate the blood in living beings.
</li><li> Earthbenders are imprisoned on an offshore metal rig. They eventually broke free by using the coal from the boiler room to earthbend. Later, Toph gets trapped in a steel cage, with her captors convinced that she can't escape because she can't bend metal. However, this just helped Toph to discover metalbending. Next time, she was locked up in a prison... made of wood. Thankfully, Katara was with her and she was able to collect enough sweat to waterbend blades that cut through the bars.
<ul><li> Folks in <em>Korra</em> were able to get around it by making cells from platinum, which doesn't have any of the impurities that make metalbending possible.
</li></ul></li><li> Even airbenders can't escape the Fire Nation's obsession with tailor made prisons. When Aang was captured by General Zhao, he was bound hand and foot in taut chains to avoid him airbending. Though he could still blow with his mouth, he was trapped so completely Zhao threatened they would keep him imprisoned until he died to avoid the hassle of searching for the next Avatar.

</li><li> In the finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>, the Thanagarians put the League into these: Superman is put under a red sun lamp to drain his powers; J'onn is encased in a forcefield to stop him shapeshifting or phasing through the walls; Flash is subjected to high gravity so he can't move and build up any speed; and Wonder Woman is tied up in the Lasso of Truth, which she can't break to escape. Wonder Woman is able to escape her cell without breaking the Lasso and release the others.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Lord Batman</a> creates restraints to hold the League, which League Batman finds impossible to get out of, since his counterpart thought of every trick he would use to escape. He also had some extra precautions, like a shield over Superman's eyes to stop him using his heat vision. However, he only thought of everything <em>Batman</em> would do, and Flash tricks him into letting him out by faking a heart attack.
</li><li> Doomsday from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em> was imprisoned in one by Project Cadmus after Justice Lord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superman">Superman</a> lobotomised him, as he was literally impossible to kill. He escapes from it with the help of a wronged minor villain, goes right back to getting his revenge on Superman, is encased in magma from a volcanic eruption, and banished to the Phantom Zone.

Presumably her cell was made tough enough that she couldn't use her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandBlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandBlast">powers</a> to break out on her own.
</li></ul></li><li> In the TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness">Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness</a></em> episode 'Owl Be Back', there are two; an owl-shaped cage for Fenghuang, and a panda shaped one for Po when it's feared he's turning evil. It also lampshades the above example by stating Po "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">obliterating</a>" Tai Lung <em>put the guards out of work</em>, and one in particular really holds a grudge toward Po about it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> the heroes create a Firewall to seal off Megabyte's entire infected sector of Mainframe.

Hexadecimal, on the other hand, easily overloads the Firewall and leaves Mainframe at Megabyte's mercy.

Sonic lets himself get captured in order to break a comic artist out of Robotnik's newly constructed prison, but he overestimated Robotnik's stupidity. Point of fact, Robotnik had built an entire specialized wing of the prison just for Sonic, meticulously designed to counter every one of his abilities and activate upon seeing his blue fur. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sonic still escapes in the end by duping the system's color-trigger with a poster of himself taped to Grounder's back, which causes the security system to attack Grounder and Scratch, leaving him to get away</span>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a>'s company is hired to make these for all the new supervillains (which is ironic, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingBothSides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingBothSides">he was also involved in their creation</a>). Sandman's was designed to use air pressure to keep him from escaping, while Rhino's released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantSedation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantSedation">tranquilizer gas</a> if he tried. Their escape was due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoElectro">Electro</a> blowing the power to the whole prison.
<ul><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonEpisode">Opening Night</a>" we see Rhino and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Mark/Molten Man</a> in a separate area of the prison. Presumably this means that Mark's cell is also designed specially, but we do not see how. (Not that it makes much difference, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">he can't control his power</a> anyway.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, it's revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> and the Red Skull have been stuck in what is one of these, "outside of time", since the ending days of WWII.

<ul><li> Dr Octopus was kept in a prison cell that were made to hold his tentacles.

She escaped when a ditzy janitor let her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">borrow his tape player</a>.
<ul><li> Superman in the DCAU has several point been held up in cells that had red sun light sent in to cancel out his powers. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hawkgirl betrayed the team in the Justice League</span>, each of the team was put in a personalized cell to counter their powers, as mentioned above.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Fire-based</a> super villain Volcana got this treatment. Her cell was a hermetically sealed vacuum filled with fire-retardent gases, with the only source of oxygen being a face mask hooked up to a tube, which can be cut off if she gets any ideas.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>, Professor X is called away to deal with a situation at the Tailor-Made Prison holding his brother (usually best known as the Juggernaut), whose security has been tampered with. Since the prisoner's supervillain name often gets prefixed with "the unstoppable" for very good reason, he's kept asleep in a liquid-filled tank without his helmet and <em>still</em> chained up just in case. Tension mounts when the safeguards need to be shut down and restarted properly, which allows him to start waking up...though in something of a subversion, while he does snap his chains without even trying hard, he's rendered unconscious again at just about the last moment before he can <em>really</em> start to move. (It turns out that the whole threat of Juggernaut getting loose was merely a distraction to get the Professor out of the way, allowing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a shapeshifted Mystique to infiltrate the school and acquire Cerebro's files on the X-Men</span> without getting caught.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em>, the Plumbers planned on placing Vilgax in one of these. To prevent Vilgax from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulating anyone into helping him to escape</a> the Plumbers were going to send him to an entirely automated prison complex with him as the sole inmate.
</li><li> The Electric Eel on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Underdog">Underdog</a></em> was captured in a large glass jar, which neutralized his "electric shocking power."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SamuraiJack/TropesSeason5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SamuraiJack/TropesSeason5">Samurai Jack</a></em>, Lazarus-93 was kept in a prison drifting through outer space. There was an entire crew tasked solely with monitoring it and containing it if it ever broke loose, and onboard was a weapon designed specifically to kill Lazarus if things got out of hand. The prison-spaceship also has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostWoods">Lost Woods</a> design in which anyone who wanders through the hallways will wind up in random areas of the ship, presumably as a means to keep an escaped Lazarus from emerging outside. This all goes awry when the ship impacts an asteroid—while the ship is physically unharmed from the collision, it sends the ship off course and onto Earth, upon which Lazarus breaks out and kills everyone else on board, requiring Jack and his new friend Ashi to defeat it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> When we are first introduced to Plasmus, his human form is submerged inside a tank full of a green liquid, completely unconscious, because as soon as he is removed from said tank and wakes up he transforms into a huge purple monster that starts destroying everything in its path.
</li><li> When the Hive Five are hunting Kid Flash, Madame Rouge specifically instructs them to not feed him or speak to him, and to hold him in a "level 4 containment field" at all times. Unfortunately, this conversation happens <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate">after</a></em> they've captured him and are keeping him in a regular cage, which he phased out of several times to grab food, having completely missed that he can phase through solid matter.

<ul><li> Professor Tite-Gripp's prison in the Mega City Maximum Security Prison for the Criminally Motivated resembles any normal jail cell, with the exception of the gargantuan manacles that leave him suspended from the ceiling, intended to prevent him from using his massive bionic arms to smash his way out of jail. However, he's escaped several times, so it seems the cell isn't foolproof (though it may have more to do with the incompetence of the guards and Tite-Gripp taking advantage of mealtime — the only time they unshackle him).
</li><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerParasite">Power Parasite</a> Absorbo Lad is captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperTeam">Justice Alliance</a>, they use a giant juicer-like machine, trapping him inside a glass case and squeezing out superpowers he's stolen in the form of a drink. It doesn't last long, as Absorbo Lad <em>eats</em> the device's wiring to absorb the Justice Alliance fortress' electrical power and escape through electric current.

<ul><li> Back in the 19th century the worst prisoners spared from death penalty were boxed in into tiny alcoves that were then bricked shut save for a window through which they were fed. In practice this was a far more cruel punishment than death, as it meant slowly wasting away from infections - apparently the builders thought that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobodyPoops">Nobody Poops</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Or they didn't care</a>.
</li><li> Countess Elizabeth Báthory de Ecsed of Sixteeth Century Hungary (aka "The Blood Countess") was a brutal serial killer who tortured and killed hundreds of young girls over several years. Scholars say there may have been as many as 650 victims, but evidence was only found for 80 of them. When caught, her accomplices were executed or sentenced to life in prison, but she was never tried for any crimes due to her noble status. Instead, she was placed under house arrest for the rest of her life, where she was immured in her bedroom with only a small opening to provide her with food. She died after living this way for four years.
</li><li> Stammheim Prison was the first supermax prison in Germany, purposely built to keep captured members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists">Red Army Faction</a>. As with many improvements in public security of the period, it was a huge failure; the captives were quite able to communicate with each other and even had firearms smuggled inside their cells.
<ul><li> The guns in question were allegedly used to commit suicide. However, persistent and not entirely baseless theories have circulated that, actually, the Baader-Meinhof gangers were executed by the German government. (Andreas Baader, for instance, fired his gun at least 3 times and supposedly shot himself in the back of the neck so the bullet exited his forehead.) So, how much of a failure the prison was is debatable.
</li></ul></li><li> Robert Maudsley, a British serial killer, was sent to prison in 1973. Whilst there he tortured and killed several people, allegedly cannibalising one, until in 1983 it was decided he was too dangerous for a normal cell. He now is kept for 23 hours a day in a glass cell where the bed is a concrete slab, the toilet and sink are bolted to the floor, and the only other thing he has is a chair and desk made from compressed cardboard. He is escorted for one hour a day to an empty yard to exercise under the supervision of six guards. The cell was made eight years before Silence of the Lambs used it for our other famous cannibal.
<ul><li> The regime has been relaxed a little in recent years, however, and Maudsley is allowed a stereo in his cell and on rare occasions is permitted contact with people besides his guards, including at least one press interview.
</li></ul></li><li> The alternate name for the page, "The Oubliette", is a dungeon in the shape of a well or bottle (hence "bottle dungeon") with a trap door at the top to let people in via a rope or rope ladder. Seeing how these were only talked in the 1880s it's very likely these alleged "dungeons" were likely places to store ice or ammo for siege weapons like catapults.
