To cope with the murder, Riz keeps making the scenario prettier and cleaner in his head, including believing that Tem <em>wanted</em> to be eaten alive, and that he willingly gave himself to Riz.</span>
</li><li> Played for laughs numerous times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>.
<ul><li> Happōsai's memories of any given set of events (and of his own appearance in his youth) are usually rather different from what really happens. Same with Genma, too.
</li><li> When Kunō suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">amnesia</a>, and sees female-Ranma for the "first" time again, his brain spontaneously generates a romantic love story of their past as a couple. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpotting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpotting">Nobody (but him) is amused</a>.
</li><li> Akane "chooses" to remember Ranma giving a fairly cogent explanation of one of his harebrained schemes as "blah-blah-blah you have small breasts blah-blah-blah" in order to justify her thumping him. The explanation involves pressure points on an adult teacher's breasts.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> when Kyon has to lie to his friend to explain how he ended up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">compromising (though technically innocent) position</a> with Yuki. He explains that she, being anemic, fainted, and he was forced to catch her. This was probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">more believable than the truth</a>, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassRepresentative">Class Representative</a>, Ryoko, attempts to kill him, and he catches Yuki after she jumps in front of large spikes to save Kyon.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MartianSuccessorNadesico">Martian Successor Nadesico</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTargetSexuality">Yurika</a> is convinced that as kids Akito would chase her around while calling her name, while Akito reminds her it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">the other way around.</a>
</li><li> During the Battle City arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, Kaiba bemoans the fact that Yugi is still regarded as a better duelist than him, even though Kaiba won their last encounter. The fact that Kaiba only won due to threatening to kill himself if he lost (at which point Yugi, who had been on the brink of victory, resigned) has conveniently been omitted from his memory.
</li><li> In the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PhiBrainPuzzleOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PhiBrainPuzzleOfGod">Phi Brain: Puzzle of God</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Pinochle</a> believes that after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Daimon Kaito</a> broke a promise with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a> Freecell, Kaito then started badmouthing Freecell behind his back to make himself look better. This turns out to have been a lie that Pinochle told himself until even he started believing it, thanks in large part to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact">Orpheus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Ring</a>. The truth is that while Kaito did break his promise, it was <em>Pinochle</em> who spread rumors about Freecell so that Freecell would have to become his friend by default.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em>, Ryuko Matoi's hatred of her arch-rival Satsuki Kiryuin grows to the point that Satsuki takes the place of Ryuko's father's killer in her flashbacks. The real killer, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nui Harime</span>, doesn't look anything like Satsuki.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>, Ritsu tries to guilt Mio into joining her band, asking her to remember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise">The Promise</a> they made years ago when they saw an amazing rock concert together. It turns out that only Ritsu was gung-ho about the idea, Mio made no such promise, and they watched that concert on TV.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ritsu:</strong> Was all that a lie!? <br/><strong>Mio:</strong> No, your story is.
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo">Tenchi in Tokyo</a></em> episode, "Tokyo or Bust!", after stopping at a diner somewhere in Japan, Ayeka tells a story to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BikerBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BikerBabe">Biker Babe</a> Masayo that she was hitchhiking to Tokyo to rescue Tenchi from "that stalker woman Sakuya"; in Ayeka's imagination, Sakuya was portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">The Vamp</a> who kidnapped and tortured Tenchi.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce">SD Gundam Force</a></em> episode "Princess in a Black Dress", Zero recounts the Gundam Force's adventures to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fake</span> Princess Rele. He uses a magically-induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a> to recast himself as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> who was responsible for the formation of the SDG, creating the White Bagu Bagu, and defeating Sazabi to save Neotopia. Shute is quick to call him out, as Zero was more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> (A role he shared with Bakunetsumaru), and it was Captain who created the White Bagu Bagu and saved Neotopia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jessie recalls meeting her Wurmple in the middle of a flower field, and herself wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PimpedOutDress">princess dress</a> when she actually caught it when she, James and Meowth were literally hanging onto a tree branch over a cliff.
</li><li> In the Unova arc, Burgundy's resentment towards Cilan was due to a Gym battle that she lost. How she recalls it that after her defeat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating">Cilan outright dissed her</a>. Him not recalling that implies that she exaggerated it.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>. Kaguya found Shirogane's actions during the fireworks arc to be incredibly suave and romantic, viewing him as a proverbial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a>. Shirogane on the other hand remembers himself as being unbelievably cringy, and spends the whole night screaming into a pillow out of embarrassment.
</li><li> After being called out by Jin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SetonAcademyJoinThePack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SetonAcademyJoinThePack">Seton Academy: Join the Pack!</a></em>, Ranka claimed that her desire to form a pack of different animals was due to her experience of being rescued by a human boy in the past. Her flashback portrayed the young boy having beaten up her tormentors (a trio of bears) while standing gallantly like a hero. Thing is, she told this to the very same boy in her childhood, and the truth was far from that: despite Jin's attempt in intervention, he took her place and received the beatings from said tormentors, leaving the young boy stripped to his underwear. The nail of the coffin to this embarrassment is when Ranka licked his wounds and eventually turned him into the animal hater he is today.
</li><li> As far as Matsuri of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AyakashiTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AyakashiTriangle">Ayakashi Triangle</a></em> remembers, he's always looked out for and protected his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Childhood Friend</a> Suzu, which eventually lead him to become an exorcist ninja who could protect her from ayakashi. But as his grandfather reminds him, Matsuri was <em>terrified</em> of ayakashi when he was young, <em>Suzu</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanRelationshipStarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanRelationshipStarter">warded off one harassing Matsuri</a> when they first met, and her taking charge of the spirits he feared is the real reason he's thinks so highly of Suzu.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> regarding Scott. On the one hand, we do see a few instances where Scott is trying to suppress bad memories, namely his mistakes and failures in his relationships. On the other hand, he does subconsciously know what he did wrong and once he actually regains his memories properly, he better confronts them.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted as well. Gideon used The Glow to also tamper with Scott's memories for his own amusement and presumably to slow him down. The most notable example was how Scott and Kim got together (note by the time he actually explains this, he has already gotten the Glow, indicated that his memories were tampered.) How he remembers it is saving her from Simon from another school in a classic beat-em-up and indeed, it's portrayed as if it happened while also showing the breakup with him and Kim. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRetcon">Cerebus Retcon</a> shows the fight between him and Simon, albeit in much less detail (though from what little could be gathered, it could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a> involving Kim). More importantly, turns out Scott did not tell Kim he was moving but got their mutual friend Lisa to do it. Kim was not happy she found out about this through Lisa and confronted him before he left, thus showing the real source of her tension with him.</span>

Mary Jane tells it in a way that she thinks will help Peter's standing at his job at the <em>Daily Bugle</em>, trying to make Spider-Man look good while portraying Peter Parker as a loyal employee and trying to make JJJ look well. In J. Jonah Jameson's account, he is the hero and Spider-Man was probably in cahoots with the robber. Peter's version is the closest to the truth (the would-be robber was a pathetic loser, JJJ embarrassed himself, etc.) but he still conceals the fact that he's Spider-Man and tries to make Jameson look better. He ends up having to pay the tab for all.

As he tells it, Caesar is sitting on a throne in beautiful golden armor looking handsome and splendid while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">battered</a> Vercingetorix bows to lay his arms at his feet. When we saw the scene happen in the first book <em>Asterix the Gaul</em>, Vercingetorix is actually throwing his arms <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">on</a></em> Caesar's feet, and Caesar is dressed poorly, is a bit overweight and looks a total mess even besides how he's howling in pain. This works on two levels. In-story it shows Caesar having a self-serving memory. On a meta level, it provides an example of how patriotic re-imaginings affect the way we look at historical events. In his own account (the only contemporaneous one), Caesar writes that Vercingetorix was handed over to him by the Gauls defending Alesia, who at the same time laid down their arms before him. The depiction in <em>Asterix the Gaul</em> parodies a well-known 19th-century painting reprinted in many French history school textbooks, which portrayed Vercingetorix as the moral victor by placing him on horseback in a dominant center position (with Caesar in the background), by taking it up to eleven.

Each one has a different view of things from who started the affair to how they were dressed on a certain day.
<ul><li> The second season expands to the views of Noah's wife, Helen, and Allison's husband, Cole, who naturally have a far different view of this "romance."
</li><li> Allison tends to think of herself as more the victim in things and sees herself as dowdy while Cole and Noah see her far more attractive and Helen views her as a conniving woman.
</li><li> Noah remembers showing up for a meeting with Helen and their attorneys in a nice suit and professional while she's hostile. Helen remembers Noah in jeans and a leather jacket and a jerk while she was cordial.
</li><li> Noah and Allison each remember being the one who saved Noah's daughter from choking at a diner.
</li><li> Noah remembers coming to dinner with Helen nice and calm and he was doing his best despite being harried at his work. Helen recalls Noah being semi-drunk and cursing. Noah also recalls being okay with his son being gay while Helen saw him as being in denial.
</li><li> Allison and Cole share a kiss that Allison remembers as slow and romantic to reignite their old passions. Cole saw it as rushed and frantic and a huge mistake.
</li><li> A truly dark example in the penultimate episode of season 4. From Ben's perspective, his talk with Allison is warm as he pours his heart out to her, troubled by his issues as a soldier and they make love. We then see Allison's version of events where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a troubled Ben admits he shot a man he knew was unarmed, tried to rape her and when she pushed him away, ended up killing her in a fight.</span>
</li><li> In season 5, Noah and Helen recall the Hindu-themed funeral for a friend with a few folks in light garb. Noah's new girlfriend, Janelle, a black woman, sees nothing but people dressed in white. Also, Noah remembers his ex-father-in-law mistaking Janelle for a waitress because of his memory problems (he still thinks Noah and Helen are married). Janelle only sees a man showing casual racism of her despite her dress (which is far nicer in Helen and Noah's recollection).
</li><li> Noah recalls meeting an actor for the movie version of his book, the guy flashy in a cafe and women coming up to get his autograph. Janelle (not a fan of the guy) just sees some nondescript figure in a baseball cap.
</li><li> Lampshaded during the filming of the movie based on the book which basically tells the entire Noah/Helen/Allison affair as the director is soon fed up by how Noah and Helen keep arguing over how true the events actually were.
</li><li> Lampshaded again when Noah meets a woman he once had an affair with and shocked she later claims he harassed her. He openly says "I have a very different memory of that night" and how he recalls her coming onto him and turning her down. Noah is later forced to admit both their versions are much the truth.
</li><li> Noah's daughter, Whitney, confronts her ex on how he had sex with her in front of another man and jarred he thinks they "made love." Worse is when she asks why he once hit her in the face during a trip in Paris...and he claims to have no idea what she's talking about, saying he never cared enough about her to even strike her.

</li><li> The Vulture describes his "two worst detectives" as a pair of losers in bad outfits and acting like morons. In reality, he only hates them because they're not friends with him and when they show up, they're actually dressed professionally and are excellent detectives; in fact, when he's called on it, it turns out it's <em>because</em> they're profession and great at their jobs why he considers them the worst (he thinks this makes them total geeks).

</li><li> Gabrielle remembers her days as a model as a fantastic time when she was hugely popular and she hated giving it all up to marry Carlos. On a trip to New York, she runs into models like Paulina Porizkova who make it clear that, even by supermodel standards, Gabby was a terrible diva who would have been kicked out of the business eventually.
</li><li> A far more dramatic case is Gabrielle being abused by her stepfather, Alejandro. She told her mother, Lucia, who didn't believe her. In a talk in the present, Carlos is horrified to realize that Lucia has convinced herself Gabrielle was making it all up, not because it's so horrible but that she refused to accept Alejandro would want the young Gabby rather than his own wife. Likewise, a nun Gabby confided in also refuted the idea that Gabby was a troublesome child. The worst is when Alejandro confronts Gabby in the present and Gabby is stunned when the man says it's her own fault as she was always flaunting her body in front of him and "was asking for it." He pays for that with his life as Carlos kills him in a fight.

Especially notable is Hardison's story in which he is a suave ladies' man while Parker remembers him as being awkward and uncouth, going so far as to hoard shrimp puffs in his pockets. Interestingly, in that episode, the four thieves remember Coswell, the museum's head of security, as being cunning, ruthless, and somehow able to foil each of them at decisive moments of their respective heists. Nate remembers the same man as being nervous, socially awkward, and silently pining after one of Sophie's characters.

They are acquitted and the JAG takes Frank down a peg by telling him his record wouldn't make him stand out as a pastry chef.
</li><li> A serious example occurs with Hawkeye in the series finale, "Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen". Hawkeye tells Sidney Freeman of being on a bus with some South Korean refugees and telling a woman to keep a chicken quiet so it won't give their position away to the enemy. But it's <em>not true.</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"It was a baby!" <em>(hysterical sobbing)</em> The woman had smothered her child.</span> This is a more poignant example of a similar plotline from an earlier episode, in which Hawkeye had uncontrollable itching for no medical reason. Hawkeye related to Sidney a childhood story of his older cousin, whom he deeply admired, who saved him from drowning in a lake. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his cousin was the one who pushed him into the lake in the first place, and Hawkeye hated him for it; Hawkeye had repressed his own memory of the truth and turned his cousin into the spotless hero</span>.

When Kochanski tries to comfort him, Kryten (who's afraid that she will replace him in Lister's life) takes a massively different tack; he creates a holographic carnival ride based on Rimmer's own "war diary". Needless to say, Rimmer's recollections are <em>massively</em> divergent from reality, depicting himself as the only competent person on the ship, rather than the cowardly, stupid, tasteless nitwit that he really is. It promotes Rimmer's clearly biased views, tastes, and interpretations of events. Lister ends the episode decrying his past with Rimmer.

Riker, the scientist's wife, and the scientist's assistant each use the holodeck to reconstruct their own versions of the events leading up to the scientist's death, in a dramatic example of the trope. Riker's version has him being almost ridiculously professional and polite even though the wife was practically throwing herself at him and the scientist unfairly blamed him for it. The wife, meanwhile, recalls Riker as being a smirking bastard who tried to bully her into sleeping with him by exploiting his rank and resorted to trying to rape her when she refused. All three of them agree that at one point it came to blows between Riker and the scientist, but Riker claims that the scientist took a clumsy swing at him which he gracefully dodged, the wife remembers it as Riker brutally beating her husband, and the assistant had the impression (from what the scientist had told her) that the scientist gave Riker a well-deserving thrashing.

At a few points in the game, the characters fight each other and as you'd expect, the one who wins is whoever the player is playing as. The official strategy guide claims that this is because the characters all remember certain details differently. This explains:
<ul><li> Why Sonic runs away from Amy in one version, leaving her to catch up with him at the entrance to Twinkle Park, while in another, he walks her there like a gentleman.
</li><li> The line "This plane's cool!" in Tails' version (when he flies by the end of Red Mountain to pick up Sonic) when no such line exists in Sonic's version.
</li><li> Tails as a tagalong who always tries to be where Sonic is in Sonic's version of the stages, while Tails always beats him to the goal in his own version.
</li><li> Oddly reversed around for Tails in Sonic's story, where he is depicted as more confident and reliable. In his own story, he has dialogue that makes him out to be insecure.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> series has two of these for two races, the krogan and the batarians:
<ul><li> The krogan fought one of the galaxy's most devastating wars centuries before the games began, and ended up being effectively neutered for it. Nowadays, many krogan attempt to play the victim card when speaking of the genophage that made them nearly sterile (the genophage only allows a 1-in-1000 live birth rate), when they were the ones that started the Krogan Rebellions by colonizing worlds that belonged to other races and then outright <em>dared</em> the Citadel to take them back. Urdnot Wrex, the krogan party member you have in the first game, eventually realizes that the krogan only have themselves to blame and resolves to change that. With your help, he can succeed in the third game.
</li><li> The batarians, however, are the opposite. Basically Space North Korea, the batarians began to send pirates and slavers to attack human settlements as they began to colonize the wider galaxy. When the humans eventually got tired of this and launched an assault on a major pirate world that the batarians supported in retaliation, the batarians appealed to the Citadel for help but got none, causing them to retreat behind their borders and instead act through pirates and slavers to attack humans, along with terrorist actions. They claim that the whole galaxy turned against them and forced them into self-imposed exile, but the truth is far less glamorous for them and Shepard can call various batarians out on this multiple times when he encounters hostile members of the species, though with the destruction of their government and society by the Reapers in the third game they might be getting better.
<div class="indent"><strong>Shepard:</strong> <em>[responding to a batarian terrorist claiming such actions are necessary because of what the galaxy did to the batarians]</em> You attacked us first. When we fought back, you went running to the Council for help, and when you didn't get it, you ran away and hid. You've got no-one to blame but yourselves.

In addition to the bizarre spelling and grammar throughout, it shows the Princess (who is a real Princess this time rather than a waitress) being madly in love with the Duke, before being kidnapped by "the coolest and toughest foe it is possible to imagine". The level is filled with banners proclaiming the citizens' undying admiration for the Duke.

The main game is composed of the PC's retelling of a mission gone awry, but the character is purposefully misrepresenting parts of the story (you take an "important package" item that doesn't really exist, for example it is made up as an excuse to hide important tools in a nook).
</li><li> The end of the demo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable">The Stanley Parable</a></em> has the Narrator flashback to all the things that happened during your crash course through the demo. At first, it's represented faithfully, but then he suddenly starts talking about you walking up endless stairs, walking across an endless catwalk, riding an elevator and then walking out into the beautiful outdoors, none of which actually took place. He seems genuinely convinced that it really did happen, though.

<ul><li> The palace rulers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> are a dark example, with each of their palaces being tailored to show how they view the world and are inhabited with twisted cognitive versions of real-life people. For instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Kamoshida</a>'s palace turns Shujin Academy into a castle where he's king, male students are his prisoners and slaves, and female students are his adoring harem. Each palace ruler is almost completely deluding themselves into believing that the state of their palaces is a reflection of reality, especially when it comes to "proving" that they're not responsible for their crimes.

For instance, Brighid boasts of a time she managed to beat Mythra in a fight - Mythra scoffs and points out the journal conveniently omits that Brighid ambushed her after she was exhausted from training all day. It starts to give Brighid an identity crisis, as she wonders if she's really the person who wrote her previous journal entries.

Boomhauer's account has everyone else talking in his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">Motor Mouth</a> fashion while he himself is perfectly intelligible. Bill's account is an inversion, as he sees himself as being even fatter and balder than he actually is. Hank's account is the truth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> up until he remembers what actually caused the fire. He ultimately blames the recently deceased Chet Elderson for plugging in his faulty Alamo Beer sign, when in reality, it was Dale who was responsible.</span>

Bleak stops her short and flashes back to what actually happened: the joke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunnedSilence">crashed and burned</a>.

It's only after he attends the titular reunion does he realize that it was the other way around: <em>he</em> was the dorky loser and Porky was the popular jock who often bullied him.

Claiming he's the Burners' "secret weapon," he makes it look like that he was responsible for all of the Burners' accomplishments, instead of Mike Chilton. Tooley becomes <em>very</em> impressed.

In each telling, the pony narrating the story depicts herself as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">only reasonable member of the group</a> (Pinkie, in particular, depicts herself as a little less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> than she usually is), who does no wrong throughout the cruise, and pleasantly humors the antics of the others. In the end, it is revealed that none of them were responsible for the actual sinking (which was actually caused by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">Bunyip who had been drawn to the surface by some cucumber sandwiches that had fallen overboard</a>). It is also implied that the actual events were a combination of elements from all their stories.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>, Mojo Jojo guilts Professor Utonium into giving him Chemical X-induced super powers by telling a sob story of how he was once the Professor's loyal lab assistant monkey who was cruelly ignored and sidelined when the girls were created. Mojo wreaking havoc with his new powers causes the Professor to remember the truth: Jojo was <em>supposed</em> to be his assistant, but was actually a helion who constantly trashed the lab. In fact, Jojo shoved the Professor when he was mixing up the "Perfect Little Girl" formula, causing the Chemical X container to break — in other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero">Mojo created the Powerpuff Girls</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">He doesn't take this well.</a> This is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">brought up in the movie</a>, as we see Jojo wreaking havoc as the Professor is working.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em>, Otto and Twister have a falling out over a skateboard trick that Otto did but Twister failed at during a game. At one point Otto tries to end the feud by telling Twister that he forgives him, but this only makes Twister angrier. When Reggie asks Otto what he thinks happened between them, he explains that he warned Twister that the trick was hard and that Twister lashed out at him when he tried to help after he got hurt. Reggie shows him a video of what really happened, of how Otto mocked Twister for being too scared to try the trick. Then after Twister tried the trick and got hurt when he failed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainOblivious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainOblivious">Otto obliviously</a> kept mocking Twister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating">and rubbed his victory in his face</a>. Realizing that he had unthinkingly insulted his friend after completely ignoring the fact that he had just gotten hurt, Otto's response to the was video was...

He says the moonlight enhanced Mermista's beauty, even though the battle happened during the day. When they were surrounded by Horde soldiers, Mermista acts like a damsel in distress even though she is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>. He recalls taking out 100 soldiers to save Mermista, but in reality, he took out one before being knocked out. Throughout the episode, he keeps bumping up the number of soldiers he supposedly defeated.

<ul><li> In "Bart Gets Hit by a Car", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Bart gets hit by Mr. Burns' car</a>. At the trial, they both tell self-serving versions of the story, but Bart's account, where Mr. Burns is a lunatic who went out of his way to hit him, is more believable; Mr. Burns' account, where he was on his way to help orphans and Bart threw himself at the car while laughing maniacally, is instantly disbelieved by the entire courtroom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">for obvious reasons</a>.
</li><li> In "The War of the Simpsons", Homer and Marge throw a party, in which Homer gets totally drunk and embarrasses himself by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">leering at Maude Flanders' breasts</a>, stumbling over furniture, etc. When confronted about this by Marge the next day, he remembers, in a pastel-colored flashback, a witty, sophisticated conversation not a million miles from the Algonquin Round Table of the 1930s.
</li><li> In "$pringfield", Homer accuses Marge of being against the casino, when she actually wasn't, and proceeds to assertively claim: "I have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">phonographic memory</a>!" Homer's "phonographic memory" of the scene is drastically different from what actually happened. Most notably, it shows Homer with ripped muscles and accepting a call from the President from something with octopus tentacles. To add insult to injury, he doesn't even correctly remember Marge's hair color.
</li><li> "Wild Barts Can't Be Broken" has Homer recalling the previous night's debaucheries in a sepia-toned silent movie titled "Homer's Night Out", which starts with him having a beer at Moe's. It then cuts to a panel saying "Scene Missing" followed by Homer frolicking around a maypole in a summery glade alongside several women in togas. This is followed by another panel saying "Scene Missing".

Lucas' flashback is much more true to the episode's events, as in Robotnik's flashback, Robotnik is a lot more handsome, Lucinda is in love with him, and Lucas is a lot braver, even going as far as to fight Robotnik for Lucinda.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode, "Dude, Where's my Eggman?" has Knuckles pull this. When Orbot and Cubot ask him if they did battle yesterday, Knuckles remembers himself as beating Eggman easily with superpowers, winning over the girls and being elected governor while Sonic ran away. It overlaps slightly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelievingTheirOwnLies">Believing Their Own Lies</a> as after he tells the story, he begins planning to write his acceptance speech for governor.
</li><li> "Fire in a Crowded Workshop", another episode of the same series, is built around this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">A fire breaks out in Tails' workshop</a>, and Sonic, Knuckles, and Amy each have different versions of how it happened. Sonic's side of the story has him portrayed as an egotistical, tough ladies' man who can do no wrong while underlining his friends' flaws. Knuckles' side is very similar to the one in "Dude, Where's My Eggman", where he is depicted as a brave captain who puts out the fire in Tails' workshop with ice breath, while Sonic is depicted as a coward. Amy's side of the story has her see Perci as a "siren" with a Southern accent who the boys blindly want to do everything for, and despite that, Amy "selflessly" gives her aid. In spite of the differences between everyone's stories, Sticks rattling off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">conspiracy theory</a> about Perci being a spy/alien/government agent before running off screaming is the one thing that remains mostly constant.

<ul><li> In "City on the Edge of Forever", which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a>, things always end more pleasantly for the character recalling previous events. Additionally, every flashback ends with everyone getting ice cream.
</li><li> "Fishsticks": Cartman tries to take credit for the fish sticks joke, and flashes back to the actual creation of the joke multiple times. Each time, it gets more and more elaborate, finally ending with him fighting an army of robot Jews as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FantasticFour">Human Torch</a>. Kyle calls Cartman out for allowing his ego-influenced memory to create false accounts of real events. Cartman brushes him off. Later on, however, Cartman assumes that <em>Jimmy</em> is the one who has this problem. In fact, Cartman's ego is so massive, that he doesn't even realize he's making things up and taking all the credit, <em>even when his life is threatened</em> because of it. His final flashback is him completely taking 100% credit for the joke, when previously Jimmy at least had a hand in it while being threatened with death by Kanye West. His inability to remember things accurately actually saves Jimmy's life.
</li><li> "Coon and Friends": The kids play superheroes, and Cartman acts like his usual selfish, bratty self while remaining convinced that he's the greatest hero this side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>. At one point, a little girl asks about Mysterion, the most popular hero in South Park, and Cartman flips out and violently attacks her until two adults pull him off. When he recalls the incident, he treats the little girl as a supervillain and the adults as civilians he was saving.

Space Ghost recalls Parker wanting to have some of his sex with him before heroically fending off an attack by a sentient ceiling tile. Zorak's is the most believable, featuring Space Ghost bumbling his way through the interview as usual before being hit by a falling ceiling tile and reduced to pitiful sobbing, but through most of it Zorak remembers the rock band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Boston">Boston</a> showing up to take him on a galactic rock tour as their keyboardist. Moltar really couldn't care less what happened during the interview, but he did recall a talking car entering his room and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">blowing his mind</a>. When neither Space Ghost nor Zorak believed that, Moltar changed his story such that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween">Michael Myers</a> broke in instead and attacked him.

In reality, Megatron abdicated his role as leader of the Decepticons and went into exile. Starscream's attempt to take control of the faction was cut short by the Predacons catching up to him completely independent of Megatron. He's not lying about the abuse, though.

When Ember arrives, she proves to be nothing but nice and sweet, but Burn claims it's all an act and plans to get back at her with a prank of her own. But after the prank, Burn and Ember have a huge argument where Ember reveals that Burn was the abuser in their relationship. When Burn recounts all the cruel pranks she remembers Ember pulling on her, Ember corrects her that all they were actually cruel pranks that Burn pulled on Ember, each of which backfired on her in some way. Burn lampshades this when she sheepishly asks her friends if "She's sensing a pattern of remembering things wrong"
