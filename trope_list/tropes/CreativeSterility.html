It is often suggested that men are thus capable only of destroying, not creating, as a way of attempting to compensate for this lack of creativity. This is often used as a way of arguing or justifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">why women are inherently better than men</a>, although it can also be used to indicate that the woman in question making this argument is a deluded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminist</a> capable only of seeing the worst in men. Furthermore, while men do not actually carry the baby, they do in fact play a fairly important role in conception... something which is rarely mentioned either way.
</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>, where elves, aliens, demons and other immortal races far older than humans typically have technology comparable or only slightly more advanced than humans. The most common explanations given, if any are, is either that the other species is creatively stagnant or that they've hit an upper technological limit and it's impossible to advance farther (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">The Singularity</a> notwithstanding). If an entire race has stagnated culturally, they may become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">Dying Race</a>  or the fact that they are dying may be the cause of the stagnation.

<ul><li> Though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a> has emotions, he's incapable of appreciating art and music. He gets an upgrade that allows him to at one point, but it has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowersForAlgernonSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowersForAlgernonSyndrome">the unfortunate side-effect of making him vulnerable to pain and fear</a>. What's interesting is that he comes to accept his differences and decides being the best robot he can be is better than trying to be a fake human.
<ul><li> Tezuka is slightly inconsistent on this, perhaps not surprising given A) the manga's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a>, which can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> quite a lot (the time stream did it!), and B) Tezuka's habit of following the rules unless it's cooler or more fun to do otherwise (see also: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a>).
</li><li> Interestingly, he is capable of all of the above, good and bad, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">1980, 2003</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AstroBoy">2009</a> versions. He still seems perfectly happy as a robot, though. The 1980 version at least <em>was</em> Tezuka-approved.
</li></ul></li><li> OEL manga <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarkOfTheSuccubus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarkOfTheSuccubus">Mark Of The Succubus</a></em> has demons who, among other things, are extremely pragmatic and don't do anything that is unnecessary. One of the things the main character finds so fascinating about humans is their ability to create beautiful things for no reason at all other than the fact that they can.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MagiciansAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MagiciansAcademy">Magician's Academy</a></em> explains the Otaku behavior of gods and devils as a result of finding humanity's creations fascinating, since being eternal beings with vast power has left them with no need for innovations or cultural identity of their own.
</li><li> The homunculi created by Father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> are incapable of performing alchemy (though some of them have alchemy-related powers, like Greed's Ultimate Shield, which is technically some sort of transmutation). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fitting the typical pattern of the trope better, Envy in particular has a massive disdain for humans that actually hides a deep-seated...well...envy for humans' ability to form emotional bonds and persevere in spite of their "inferiority"; this envy eventually drives Envy to despair and suicide.</span>
<ul><li> Father himself qualifies. Despite his incredible power, he never actually develops any alchemical techniques of his own, only countering or mimicking the abilities of others. Tellingly, a persons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GateOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GateOfTruth">Gate of Truth</a> is adorned with a mural representing all their knowledge; when we see Fathers own Gate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">its <em>completely blank</em>, indicating that for all the work and study he put into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>, he never actually <em>learned</em> anything. He just copied the homework of real alchemists.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Zentraedi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> have shades of this. They are kept deliberately ignorant of how to use technology, with all of it being provided by the Robotech Masters. This is a form of control; without the Robotech Masters to guide them, all of the Zentraedi's technology will eventually break down, and they will be unable to fight their wars.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>, the Zentraedi are similarly kept ignorant of how to produce and repair their own technology. However, they still wipe out their creators, and are able to keep going because all of their factories are automated: they just have to give the factory new materials, and it pumps out new weapons. When they join human civilization in later installments, their old technology is improved upon, and Zentraedi engineers and scientists begin to pop up as they become educated.
</li><li> A major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits">Chobits</a></em>, mostly coming out late in the story, is that no matter how human the persocoms look, they cannot have children because they're robots.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> realizes that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Drifters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Drifters">Drifters</a> bring new technologies and knowledge to a world roiling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>; for example, as a warlord, he finds the simple crystal balls used by the Octobrist Organization for quick communication in the battlefield a much more revolutionizing idea than actual magic. As the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, Oda is thoroughly studying this and incorporating it into his world-conquest campaign.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>
<ul><li> The Saiyans from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> are depicted as this, at least in the anime. All their vast technical advancements are either stolen from the Truffles they murdered, bought in exchange for mercenary work, or given to them by Frieza's empire. Even the armor they wear that Vegeta calls Saiyan formal wear were all from Frieza. At the same time, since the Saiyans weren't natives of Planet Vegeta, they must have had some form of space travel, but it was lost to them for some reason. In the art of fighting, however, they do show some creativity, like their elites being able to create false moons so they can transform into Great Apes.

</li><li> Erasmus from <em>Dune</em> is a subversion of this trope. His constant goal is to unlock the secrets of human creativity and existence. This goal is also the driving force behind many of his experiments. For example, in <em>The Butlerian Jihad</em> (the first of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegendsOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegendsOfDune">Legends of Dune</a></em>), he attempted to create a still life using <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the blood and organs of a couple of his servants, (and in the end the final product did not satisfy him, as it was mere COPYING, not real creativity)</span>. He also composed a very emotionless and stylised "symphony" in the same book.

Many an elven villain's lair is described as a bad knock-off of a Hollywood horror film.
<ul><li> One of the funnier moments in this respect was when an evil elf got all huffy because someone saw his throne room and commented, "I think you owe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankFrazetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankFrazetta">Frank Frazetta</a> licensing rights." The elf's response implied he'd <strong>already</strong> been sued by Frazetta at least once.
</li><li> They don't have anything like human imagination. Elven Bards create music and play it very well, but it's not <em>new</em> music, just minor variations on what's come before. When a human bard created a work for a christening and played it, the elves were astonished. Also, while the elves have extraordinarily long lives, they tend to fall into patterns, and eventually fade away for lack of anything new. A human living with some actually roused a number back into vitality by suggesting that they go and hunt wild monsters in abandoned domains - something which had never occurred to them.

</li><li> In "Andy Warhol's Dracula", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there's a subversion — it's widely agreed that the artworks Warhol created after he became a vampire lack an essential spark present in his earlier work, but it turns out at the end that Warhol never actually crossed over, only adopted vampire mannerisms, and remained human his entire life</span>.
</li><li> The series plays with this trope, in that several other famous celebrities — including Bob Dylan — also become vampires, and all suffer from this to a degree. However, several of these criticisms — including those raised in-text about Dylan — are similar to criticisms these artists have faced in real life as they got older and their careers / fields moved on.
</li><li> The first book, set only a few years after Dracula's conquest of Britain, features a number of vampires who are apparently still successful in creative jobs including satirist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GilbertAndSullivan">WS Gilbert</a> and poet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a>.

According to Granny Weatherwax, their creative sterility <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">comes from their immortality</a>:
<div class="indent"><em>What don't die don't live. What don't live don't change. What don't change can't learn. The smallest creature that dies in the grass knows more than you.</em>

They do not approve of the untidiness of life, creativity and all that. During efforts to get rid of it, some of them take human form. They cannot eat or drink because the sensory overload would destroy them, yet they consider rules, including protocol, important, so when one of them comes up with the excuse "our religion forbids it" for declining tea it was a stroke of creative genius, for an Auditor.
</li><li> Death is frequently reported to have this problem as well. Ysabell and Susan both observe that his house and everything in it is "just a copy of one he's seen somewhere." His attempts to play musical instruments produce only a horrible racket, which greatly frustrates him. This is used rather cleverly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SoulMusic">Soul Music</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by playing the guitar that has been causing all the trouble, Death effectively kills the music, forcing it to revive Buddy so he can bring it back.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> This is toyed with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Footfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Footfall">Footfall</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryPournelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryPournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a>. The invading aliens use scavenged technology, and only understand how to use what they have, not how to invent anything. This mirrors their military weakness and sociological blind spot; they cannot develop new tactics, nor understand that humans might react to a situation differently than they do. Even our concept of lying boggles their minds.
</li><li> The Thrintun in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnownSpace">KnownSpace</a></em> books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>. They telepathically enslaved the highly inventive Tnuctipun. From that moment, all inventions in Thrintun society were done by Tnuctipun, while the Thrintun degenerated.
</li><li> This is an important plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Coraline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Coraline">Coraline</a></em> — Coraline realizes that The Other Mother can't actually create anything genuinely new, just mimic and alter things that already exist... and the implications of this realization allow her to figure out where her parents are being kept, and in the movie, it's very clear that the Other Mother only shapes existing materials into her creations, as the decay reveals what her puppets are made of.
</li><li> The idea is brought up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> - Andalites and Yeerks begin to fear humans once they realize that humans, while much less technologically advanced, made technological progress far faster than their more advanced counterparts. Ax, an Andalite, is astonished to learn that humans went from first powered flight to space flight in under a century.
<ul><li> The Yeerks are also cited (admittedly, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Andalites</a>) as having stolen everything they have from other races, being capable of modification (Dracon beams kill more slowly and painfully than the shredder beams they're based on, for example) but not true creation.
<ul><li> Since the Yoort (related to the Yeerks somehow) were at least partially responsible for the mind reading devices that are the basis of their 'memory markets' this spreads further doubt on the Andalite's claims.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge">The Diamond Age</a></em> uses an original poem as an impromptu Turing test, reasoning that a sufficiently advanced Eliza-style chatbot might be able to carry a conversation but couldn't make the creative leaps necessary to interpret, much less create, symbolic language. She's right; in essence, artificial intelligence systems are philosophical zombies in the novel's world.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">The Tommyknockers</a></em>, where the alien-touched become capable of incredible feats of technological jury-rigging and improvisation, yet are such bumbling incompetents at taking practical advantage of their skills that the benefit of such talent is negligible.
<ul><li> The most extreme example of this is the woman who gains super-intelligence and inventive skill and uses it to make a crude boobytrap to kill her cheating husband. That's it. Even the other alien-influenced people at least had the stones to do something like make laser guns or teleporters...no, she built a crude electric chair. And died too. Literally too dumb to live, in spite of being a super-genius now.
</li><li> They're also unable to see the blatantly obvious. They begin to panic when the ordinary batteries they're running everything off of start to die. Not one of them thinks about building an AC-DC converter or simply adapting ones that must have been all over a modern American town and getting their electricity from the wall outlets, also all over a modern American town.

</li><li> A core concept of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TolkiensLegendarium">Tolkien's Legendarium</a></em>:
<ul><li> "The Enemy cannot make, he can only mock", and thus any creature he cannot corrupt to his side, he simply makes bad copies of. Melkor, the greatest of the Ainur is described as having part of the abilities of all the others. However, he lacks a unique talent of his own. As a result, all he does is derivative. Specifically, Orcs are Morgoth's corruption of the elves, trolls are the corruption of the Ents, and dragons are implied to be corruptions of the Maiar with bodies bred from "corrupted stock." Even Gollum is just a twisted version of a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> hobbit</span>.
</li><li> The idea may seem undermined by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a> of everyone else in the setting, but the lack of technological progress (and in fact technological regression, since the Númenóreans may have had self-powered ships at the height of their power and Morgoth may have had something akin to a tank back in the first age, depending on how you read <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R.

<div class="indent"><strong>Oar:</strong> What do young people think of this, Nimbus? The young Fasskisters and Cashlings. Do they ever look around and say, <em>Why are things not better?

Out in the depths of space, light-years away from anything, I've watched Cashlings weep over who they are... who they aren't... what their race has become. That's how prophets are born: a moment of clarity, the desire to transform themselves and the universe. But it never lasts. They can't <em>make</em> it last. They're <em>damaged</em>, Oar — even if they experience a flash of profundity, they can't sustain it, they can't use it, they can't preserve the desire to change. I've watched them; they can't become anything else, not even with other species to learn from. They simply lack the capacity. The Cashlings are lost, and other races are following them into the darkness. On their best days, they long to be truly alive... but they're physically incapable of pushing themselves past the emptiness.

When he asks a mortal companion why a sculpture that would make Michelangelo cry seems so lifeless, the companion responds that it is the flaws, idiosyncracies, interpretations, and trademark techniques of the artist that give the creation life, and Fulgrim's sculptures, perfect representations of the human form though they are, have no unique character to them.

The one time she tries to innovate something new, namely S.P.E.W., she screws it up.

Also bear in mind the 'pro-life' Natalie faction only came to that decision when they had in effect already lost immortality by, unless they got Galactica's help, already losing the civil war and so facing permanent boxing (in essence the war broke out before they even considered giving up immortality). The creators of all Cylons, the final five, believed in this trope but also had no problem making themselves and their 'children' immortal, so neither faction really had their mindset down exactly.</span>

<ul><li> The Goa'uld appear to have stolen or found all of their technology, although we do see a few Goa'uld scientists here and there.
</li><li> The Asgard are probably a better example, totally lacking a certain type of imagination. Thor states in one episode that sometimes the answer to a problem may lie in a less sophisticated approach and that the Asgard can no longer think in such a simplistic manner (they essentially keep trying to one-up their own technological developments). He also says that the Asgard wouldn't think of creating a chemically-propelled kinetic weapon, like the machine guns used by Earth's humans. Given that the average Asgard is several hundred years old due to using multiple cloned bodies with transferred minds and it makes more sense. Its generally accepted that people tend to get more stubborn and stuck in their ways as they age. If the Asgard are remotely like this its likely that they really can't see a better solution for something than an upgrade of what they already have.

They may not have much interest in writing sonnets, but they're extremely dangerous because they constantly adapt to attempts to destroy them, learn from their mistakes, and improve themselves. Though their "greatest advancement" is to make humanoid versions of themselves, they mainly do this to flaunt their perceived superiority to humans.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> has this demonstrated all over the place, many alien species have progressed to a certain technological point and just leave it at that.

It can easily be argued that they have advanced more since the establishment of the human-dominated Federation than they had over more than a millennium prior.

<ul><li> Discussed at length in the Season 2 episode "Elementary, Dear Data". In an argument between LaForge and Pulaski, LaForge argues that Data is capable of original deduction, while Dr. Pulaski counters that while Data's deductive skills may <em>seem</em> original, they are in fact only derivative of what he already has in his databanks. To experiment, they LARP through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> mystery, while Data solves in the prologue, having read the story in question before. Upping the ante, they asked the holodeck for an adventure with Holmes-like elements, which Data again solves in the opening minutes, as the computer had created a story featuring story elements from two different books. LaForge argues that Data had deduced a trap in the story using available evidence, while Pulaski counters that he'd simply recognized elements he'd read about before, making the experiment a push. Finally, LaForge asks the computer for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalFlavor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalFlavor">Original Flavor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> holodeck <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a> with the difficulty level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> to challenge Data. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> (to challenge <em>Data</em>, not "Holmes") result in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">creation of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Professor Moriarty</a>, whose antics quickly push the experiment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DebateAndSwitch">to the wayside</a>. However, when the Moriarty character returns in a later episode, Data successfully deduces his deception and saves the day.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Interestingly</a>, this plot also implies that at the same time as discussing whether Data is capable of original thought, both of them implicitly <em>assume</em> that the ship's main computer is!
</li><li> On the other hand, in the third season episode "The Ensigns of Command," Data expresses doubts over his own ability to create. In his argument he cites his violin playing, which while technically perfect, is <em>musically</em> imperfect since he lacks soul and creativity. By the end of the episode, however, Picard notes that Data was able to successfully blend two <em>vastly</em> differing and seemingly incompatible stylistic influences into one unique, cohesive and original style.
</li></ul></li><li> The Borg are presented as an example of this. As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a> composed of trillions of sentient beings, many of whom were assimilated against their will, the Borg suppress individual thought and initiative. Their preference is to acquire new knowledge via assimilation rather than through innovation.
<ul><li> When introduced in "Q Who", the Borg seek to understand the <em>Enterprise-D</em> by carving it up and assimilating the technology.
</li><li> In "The Best of Both Worlds", the Borg have decided to invade the Federation. To facilitate this, they abduct and assimilate Captain Picard in order to gain his knowledge of Starfleet's capabilities and tactics.
</li><li> As shown in "Descent", Borg drones that are severed from the Collective end up at a loss as to what to do with themselves. To the extent that Data's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> Lore is able to become a sort of crazy cult leader to them because even he has more creative ideas than they do!
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> episode "Scorpion", the Borg were facing a war against Species 8472, aliens from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">Another Dimension</a> whose biology and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">Organic Technology</a> were immune to assimilation, which is the only method the Borg have of adapting and being the malevolent juggernaut they are. The <em>Voyager</em> crew, on the other hand, took time to study the alien biology and devised a weapon actually capable of harming 8472 (based on Borg technology). Janeway made an explicit observation of the irony.
</li><li> In "The Omega Directive", the Borg are shown to revere the "Omega Molecule" as the embodiment of perfection. They acquired bits of knowledge about it from thirteen different species before attempting disastrous experimentation of their own which resulted in the destruction of 29 cubes and 600,000 drones. Seven-of-Nine manages to use knowledge acquired from a fourteenth species as well as Starfleet to devise a way to safely contain and break down Omega. It was implied she would not have been able to do this using just the knowledge she had from the Borg.

</li><li> Invoked, explored and ultimately averted in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> where the holographic Doctor creates a holo-novel and sends the first draft to a publisher. Said publisher then publishes the first draft without the Doctor's permission, arguing that, as an artificial intelligence, he isn't capable of being an author. The resulting trial concludes by granting the Doctor rights as an author but stops short of declaring him a person.
</li><li> The Pakleds are like this. Their species are under-developed intellectually and are before the point that they could have actually developed warp capabilities on their own (in fact the ones seen on the show don't seel like they could handle fire or the wheel). They became a spacefaring race by stealing from other, more advanced species because they would rather have such things now than wait to develop it themselves. When the Enterprise finds a Pakled ship, it's really just a hodge-podge of parts from various different starships.

<ul><li> Many Christian theologians apply this trope to Satan.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> vampires suffer from this to a large degree. The reason Vampires haven't taken the world by storm with their stunning works of art and literature is that all vampires find themselves mentally locked into the era in which they lived. Adapting their mindset to account for changing times is a massive effort, and even then they find themselves at least one step behind the human world. Along with that, the creative "spark" that drives the pursuit of art and music is largely extinguished during the Embrace. Many vampires simply cannot break through the ennui they experience to bother practicing their arts. However, they CAN innovate new disciplines and Blood Sorceries, meaning its not so much that they cannot be creative...they're just modelocked in such a way it removes their ability to keep up with the times in Mortal Society, and cannot create emotional works very easily, as most Vampires tend to be somewhat detached from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">their dinners</a>
<ul><li> Victoria Ash, a Toreador vampire with the voice of an angel and a body to match, had been trying for over a century to burst onto the global music scene. The best she could manage was to become a one-hit pop wonder who blipped onto the public radar for a couple weeks and vanished just as quickly, while other less talented and certainly less beautiful singers continued to drown her out.
</li><li> Curiously, Nosferatu vampires who can <em>generously</em> be described as what happens when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeOrlok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeOrlok">Looks Like Orlok</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Red Right Hand</a> have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadChild">undead baby</a>, avert this. Their artwork is said to evoke a lot of emotion springing from their alienation from both mortal and vampire society. They create sculpture gardens built underground from raw materials and debris with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, and never intended to be seen by anyone, as well as haunting melodies using the acoustics of the subway system. In a twisted way, they're better artists than the clan of artists.
</li><li> The same lack of creativity was applied to vampires in the first edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em>, but this trait was removed in the 2nd edition update.

<ul><li> The Adeptus Mechanicus view any sort of technological innovation as heresy. Somewhat justified, as they believe that knowledge was discovered by ancient humans and then lost, and as such new ideas could potentially be paths for Chaos to infiltrate, but given that everything is getting worse for the Imperium every year (technologically), this may not be the best policy, especially since the Emperor's life-support system is failing...
</li><li> While the Exodites and Asuryani Eldar have access to far more advanced technology than they currently use, they deliberately use less-advanced tech so they don't fall to the temptations of Chaos that doomed their empire (automation breeds decadence). On the other hand, the Drukhari still use the tech at the level they had at the Fall of the Eldar Empire, which is still far more advanced than most other races.

The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Majitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Majitek">Majitek</a> they do have was provided by the Old Ones thousands of years ago and has simply been maintained in perfect working order for millennia.

<ul><li> The Covenant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> fit the creatively stagnant explanation. Most of their tech is (poorly) reverse-engineered from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Forerunner</a> ruins, and they never bothered to develop their inferior knock-offs much further. Although even these poor copies are still far more advanced than humanity's own native technology, the Covenant is largely ignorant of how to use their tech to its maximum potential, often running their spaceships inefficiently, for example. Their intellectual stagnation has gotten so bad that their understanding of fundamental scientific concepts like <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations">Maxwell's equations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is often far behind humanity's. Lucky thing for the humans they declared war on; by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>, humanity has not only managed to reverse-engineer a good deal of Covenant equipment, but improve upon them.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> as being religious devotion. Since the Covenant thinks the Forerunners are gods, any attempt to even just better understand, much less improve upon, their "perfect" creations runs a big risk of being seen as heresy, with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloFirstStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloFirstStrike">Halo: First Strike</a></em> revealing that the Covenant don't even do things that their own technology is already capable of; Cortana greatly improved the firepower of a captured ship's weapons by basically changing the settings, which the local Covenant AI responded to by <em>accusing her of blasphemy</em>.
</li><li> Additionally, only two species in the Covenant, the Prophets and Engineers, were even allowed to do anything resembling actual R&amp;D, with the former so few that they were always on the brink of becoming horrifically inbred, and the latter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">deliberately designed</a> by their original Forerunner creators to focus their impressive intelligence primarily on maintenance, repair, and making relatively incremental (but still impressive) improvements to preexisting pieces of tech. The Brutes do eventually seem to get a pass to tinker a bit with Covenant tech (as seen with the faster-firing Brute plasma rifles), possibly due to the Prophet of Truth's influence.
</li><li> Unlike most examples, though, it's been stated that the Covenant races <em>are</em> fully capable of creating new technologies, with the majority of them having already achieved spaceflight before they began using Forerunner technology; the Elites in particular had already reached roughly the same technological level as 26th century humanity by <em>938 BCE</em>. Indeed, supplemental materials have implied that the Elites in particular have doing surprisingly well in closing the "creativity gap" with humanity in the post-war era, while in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloCryptum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloCryptum">Halo: Cryptum</a></em>, the Forerunners actually note that the ancient Prophets were a scientifically-talented species, to the point where their technology equaled that of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their "prehistoric" human allies, who themselves were advanced enough to be nearly a match for the <em>Forerunners</em></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Protoss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em> also fit this trope. Although they have access to tons of advanced tech humans don't have, such as advanced psychic powers and incomparable teleportation and shield technology, the human units can still match theirs in battle. And to drive the point home on how creative terrans can be with Protoss tech, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIWingsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIWingsOfLiberty">Starcraft II Wings Of Liberty</a></em>, the single-player campaign lets the player conduct research into Protoss technology, and some of the results lets them do stuff the protoss can't, like automate their refineries so they can operate without workers, speed up collection rate at said refineries, and instantly deploy troops to any locale from orbit, rather than worry about psionic power fields. There's actually some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> when you discover the automated refinery, the descriptive blurb wondering why the Protoss never thought of this, and decides it may be due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">religious traditions</a>.
<ul><li> Strictly speaking, though they get new units in the sequel <em>Heart of the Swarm</em>, the Protoss still suffer from this; it's their estranged exiled brethren, the Dark Templar/Nerazim that have made the innovations. The new Stalker was designed by the Dark Templar, the Immortal is just an upgraded old unit according to the lore, the Colossus and Mothership are old weapons they've just not used until now, and the Void Ray is a joint effort between the Dark Templar and the Khalai. Thus, the only new units the Protoss have that they actually designed themselves are the Phoenix and Void Prism (the Sentry has no unit lore so the jury is still out on how it came about).
</li><li> Tal'Darim engineering is basically "jailbreak stolen technology until you find maximum DPS" and then ignore all the glaring problems this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> causes - including low unit HP, which may actually be a feature if the unit happens to be piloted by a specific caste of worthless pariahs.
</li><li> Come <em>Legacy of the Void</em>, the protoss had cast this trope off due to necessity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Khala was abandoned after being exposed as a tool of enslavement by their uplifter, the Xel'Naga Amon.</span> On top of that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you don't even have to be of flesh and blood to be counted as a protss and an equal; just look at the Purifiers.</span> That said, while the protoss can have their automated assimilators, they have to sacrifice their Nexus defenses and advanced warp technology to utilize it.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09eis');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note09eis" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09eis');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Advanced by protoss standards, at least; the upgrade in question allows Robotics Facilities and Stargates to warp-in units to any location with pylon power, not just the Gateways.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> games, particularly the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em>, do this a lot. As their namesake suggests, they are far more inclined to steal technological and cultural ideas from other races than not, though to be fair they will improve on or at least <em>adapt</em> to such designs when possible. If the series ever shows a piece of technology in both an original and a Space Pirate variant, the Space Pirate version is better. The exception is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies">Chozo tech</a>, of which the Pirates can only make vastly inferior imitations, when they can figure it out at all.
<ul><li> One scan of a Space Pirate log in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em> game reveals that they've been trying to figure out Samus' morph ball. They have, to an extent - they can give one of their men a suit that, when activated, forces the occupant into a spherical space. What they haven't figured out is how Samus comes out in one piece; all their test subjects are reduced to candy-coated Pirate Nuggets with crunchy bits in their gooey centers, and the ones who survive the experience would generally benefit more from a mercy killing than medical attention.
</li><li> The Chozo got hit with a strange version of this: they became so advanced that they couldn't come up with anything better than what they already had. They decided that they'd hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">the technological peak</a> and instead turned to a simple life of mysticism. Not that they gave up their scientific knowledge, they just didn't use it unless they had to.
<ul><li> A possible justification is that they used to be warriors. They were faced with a dilemma: keep making high-tech weapons to fight and wage war, or stop developing technology and become pacifists. They chose the latter, which worked out just fine until Phazon meteorites showed up. It's very possible that the could have become corrupted by Phazon and gone on to wreck the galaxy if they had not spent centuries as philosophers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIIINocturne">Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</a></em>, only humans are capable of making a Reason, the necessary impetus that reshapes the new world. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">demons</a> that have taken over the land side with the remaining half-dozen human survivors despite their lack of powers for this reason. As he was forcibly transformed into a half-demon before he could make a Reason, this fact becomes <em>very</em> important to the Demi-Fiend. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The game ends up having two 'neutral' endings, depending on whether the main character lives more based on his human or demon side. With the human ending, he ends up successfully conceiving and executing the same Reason as Ms. Takao where she failed (due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a> tendencies on her part), whereas the demon one ends with you trying to do so, but not being human enough to create said Reason, preventing the world from regenerating due to fear of ridicule and hatred (since by that point you've murdered everyone save for Ms. Takao, who lacked the proper will to make her own Reason and has aleady been vaporized anyway), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">or the PC simply likes the Vortex World as is and keeps it.</a> </span>
<ul><li> Although some demons are certainly lacking in this regard, this is more of a rule than anything. A Loa in the First Kalpa implies the demons are immortal in their own way due to having sacrificed their ability to change, while humans kept the same ability at the cost of being mortal. The Loa also wonders what that means to the Demi-Fiend, he who shares the demons' power and the humans' ability to change and adapt.

</div><ul><li> Also applies to the game universe as a whole as virtually all advanced technology in the series is based off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Prothean</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Reaper</span> technology.

</li><li> This is also alluded to in regards to humanity. Before the appearance of humans on the galactic scene, things were relatively stable, treaties had been crafted to limit military power, and the galactic scale was mostly balanced, having remained unchanged since the Krogan Rebellions. When humanity arrived on the scene, they used bizarre new tactics and unconventional technologies, making the other races scared of them. No other race, for example, would allow a planet to fall under alien control while a rapid reaction force arrived from somewhere else (the other races would instead have significant military forces around each planet they controlled). When humans were told that they couldn't field too many dreadnought-class ships, they responded by obeying the letter of the law and introducing carriers. The concept of a stealth ship never occurred to anyone before the humans developed the <em>Normandy</em>. In effect, human has exploded onto the scene, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAdvanceSwiftly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAdvanceSwiftly">achieving in 30 years what most races took centuries to do</a>, and it <em>scares the crap</em> out of everyone else.
</li><li> Similarly, the <em>Normandy</em> was not only revolutionary for being a stealth ship, but also for being a collaboration between human and turian engineers to design a vessel that incorporated both race's design philosophies into a single vessel. The second <em>Normandy</em> takes this further with Cerberus engineers expanding upon the original design and installing an onboard AI created from Reaper tech to manage the cyber-warfare systems. Shepard later incorporates prototype ablative armour from the Alliance, a turian-designed Thanix cannon retro-engineered from Sovereign, Quarian Cyclonic shielding and a Reaper IFF into the ship, making the <em>Normandy</em> a frigate with nearly the same firepower and sturdiness as a dreadnought.
</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">main Geth faction</span> holds the belief that using technology provided or scavenged from more advanced races stunts the development of races; this is the main reason they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">refused Nazara's (Sovereign) offer of a Reaper body in place of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysonSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysonSphere">Dyson Sphere</a>.</span>

Whether he's telling the truth is up in the air, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsNeverLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsNeverLie">he is a villain, after all</a> (and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Templar</span> as well) and the sequel muddies things further. On the one hand, Altaïr makes several major advancements by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">studying the Apple's database</span>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardoDaVinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> makes innovative improvements to the original designs.

</li><li> Certain government types in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> series can stunt cultural or technological development <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessaryDrawback">in exchange for other bonuses</a>. For example, in <em>Civilization Revolution</em>, Fundamentalism boosts military power but nerfs science, and Communism gives a bonus to production but nerfs culture. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in the latter case by the fact that cultural bonuses all derive from religious structures.)
</li><li> The Combine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>. Though they possess technology far in advance of humanity, it all appears to have been violently appropriated from their countless previous conquests and twisted for their own purposes.
</li><li> The later games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series show that this is the case with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">Brotherhood Of Steel</a>. They believe that advanced pre-war technology must be stored and almost never used, and that anyone from outside the Brotherhood is an idiot or a madman who will use it to kick off another nuclear war. This combo of hoarding and xenophobia worked at first, but as the years went on more factions developed their own weapons and philosophies, and the Brotherhood began to die out. The West Coast chapter of the Brotherhood was all but destroyed by factions they considered beneath them; turns out all the laser rifles in the world won't help against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">vastly greater numbers</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">artillery shells</a>. Only the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> era East Coast chapter of the Brotherhood averted this, recruiting from outside the organization, doing R&amp;D and adopting a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless">We Help the Helpless</a>" approach. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> they've fallen back into their old ways harder than ever, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and can end up being destroyed by the artillery-and-musket wielding Minutemen or the guerrilla tactics of the Railroad.</span>

</li><li> Fallen Empires in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> are ancient civilizations well past their prime, with only a single Fanatic ethos (whereas normal empires can have a fanatic ethos and a non-fanatic or three non-fanatic) to represent the ideal they still cling to. They don't explore or expand or research any new technology - though they're several millennia ahead of normal empires when they start. They don't replace any of their losses either, making it possible for a mid/late-game normal empire to challenge them by simply burying them in conventional ordinance and winning through attrition. Tackling them is still dangerous because your rivals will always be looking to capitalise on your flanks while you're occupied, and when you win, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakenTheSleepingGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwakenTheSleepingGiant">the other Fallen empires take notice</a>.
</li><li> Omega in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has the extraordinary and dangerous ability to create simulations of life by manipulating ambient aether. But as a soulless machine, Omega has no real imagination to work with. It's designed to record all information in its infinite databanks. It can create copies of what it's learned of, either from historical records or works of fiction, because it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellFictionFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellFictionFromReality">Cannot Tell Fiction from Reality</a>. So long as a concept seems logical, it becomes real to Omega.

Even the rebel protagonists borrow all their non-magical techniques from ancient history and modern television.
</li><li> Elves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater">8-Bit Theater</a></em> fit this trope. Red Mage once lampshaded it by asking Thief why the elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">had technology on par with humans</a> when their culture had had a 7,000 year head start, to which Thief lamely answered "we like it that way." To be fair, we shouldn't expect every species or culture to develop at the same speed or in the same direction. Still, the elves basically just... stopped. Thief even have to concede the naming department of Elfland needs a bit more imagination.
<ul><li> It was also played with earlier, when the Elven King awoke from a long illness, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyJetpack">wanted to know what advancements his society had made</a>, then was disappointed when the answer was basically 'none'.
</li></ul></li><li> In the long-on-hiatus <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GossamerCommons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GossamerCommons">Gossamer Commons</a></em>, this is part of the premise. The protagonist, Keith, falls under a death curse, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> offer to grant him one boon before he dies. He decides what he most wants is to write a great novel. This is a problem for the fairies, who thought they had figured out all the loopholes in possible wishes; they have no way of making Keith write a great novel, so they're stuck keeping him alive until he accomplishes it on his own.

<ul><li> This trope, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Humans Are Special</a> in the creativity department, may become increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> in a field of artificial intelligence research called 'artificial creativity' as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">AI and machine learning become more advanced</a> and psychology and neuroscience unveils the nature of human artistic preferences (because after all, it is people who judge the creative quality of art). For example, David Cope has created a computer program "Emily Howell" that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2254232/">has had its own highly rated albums released.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> apparently believed the Japanese were like this. It is true that most of the things Japan is known for technologically and culturally are refined versions of things developed in other countries, but then, the same could be said for a lot of places. However, post-Cold War Japan largely manages to avert this, as the country has gained a reputation for being a place of dynamic creativity and technological breakthroughs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a> gets a lot of accusations of this trope. While ancient China was known for developing many foundational technologies that have forever altered the world such as paper, gunpowder, printing, and the compass, critics note that the country hasn't innovated much after the 1200s (perhaps not coincidentally when the Mongols invaded and conquered them). It doesn't help either that the current Chinese government makes extensive use of spies and hackers to steal technology from the rest of the world, nor that Chinese culture in general doesn't place a high value on copyright and patent protections, leading to a lot of knockoffs and therefore a disincentive to create.
</li><li> The firearms industry in general gets this a lot. There haven't been many major technological breakthroughs in gun manufacturing since the 1950s for rifles (when the ArmaLite company introduced its famous AR-series rifles made out of "Space Age materials") and the 1980s for pistols (when Glock lightweight polymer-framed pistols exploded onto the scene). When new guns get released to the public, you can expect, like clockwork, to see gun owners immediately accusing the manufacturer of copying some other design. This got rather funny after the conclusion of the U.S. military's Modular Handgun System competition, when numerous gun companies who had participated released their contest submissions for civilian sales in 2016/2017 and flooded the market with tons of black polymer 9mm pistols, leading to cries of "nothing but Glock clones."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1yvms');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1yvms" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1yvms');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ironically, the Glock wasn't even the first polymer-framed pistol to be manufactured on a large-scale: that honor belongs to the Heckler &amp; Koch VP70 which was released in 1970, 12 years before the Glock 17 came out. And even earlier than that, the Soviets had drawn up plans for a polymer-framed version of their Makarov PM pistol in the 1960s, the TKB-023, which had a small batch produced for military trials but was ultimately cancelled in 1965</span>
<ul><li> Most semi-automatic pistols use the Browning locking mechanism, or variations thereoff, which was invented in the early 20th Century, demonstrating a strong 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it' mentallity.
</li><li> Chris Bartocci from Small Arms Solutions <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVVRdTZyW8Y&amp;t=4m40s">in this video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> specifically calls out American combat pistol design as being particularly stagnant for decades (at least for full-size duty sidearms; subcompact concealed carry pistols have seen some innovations since the mid-2010s). It is quite telling that in both the Joint Service Small Arms Program contest in the 1980s and the Modular Handgun System competition in the 2010s, there was not a single American pistol among the finalists. The JSSAP came down to SIG vs. Beretta (which Beretta won) and the MHS was down to SIG vs. Glock (which SIG won), all 3 of which are European companies.
</li></ul></li><li> Not even humans as a whole are immune to this accusation, as a common viewpoint is that nothing is original. Every work of art, fiction, fashion, etc. is made by copying others, and such things frequently go through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">cyclical trends.</a> Whether this is actual creative sterility comes down to whether you think creativity requires the creation of something wholly original, or if it allows for mimicry or innovation of pre-existing ideas.
