Some TV shows, films, and video games are guilty of assuming that characters can't see something <em>just</em> off-screen because, well, the viewer can't, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">the viewer is the center of their universe</a>. And don't start on the countless cartoons where somebody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindAStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindAStick">hides "behind" a tree</a> where even the viewer <em>should</em> be able to see them...

<ul><li> Old Navy's 2009 Christmas commercials featured the mannequins going about town looking for Santa Claus. They think they might've finally found him at one point; he's got his back to the camera but he should be making eye contact with the mannequins, and they don't realize it's just some guy until he turns to face the camera, meaning he has his back to the mannequins.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The ability to step off screen and disappear to other characters is developed into an almost super-human talent in the anime and manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasuke">Kuroko no Basuke</a></em>. The main character, Kuroko, becomes invisible to other characters by virtue of always being out of frame. He can also deliberately disappear or reappear by ducking in and out of view. This happens numerous times every episode, especially on the basketball court. But as other characters become aware of his special talent, the trick becomes less effective and they start to be able to see him behind the black.
</li><li> In the third episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a>: Shippuden</em> Deidara says that his infiltration of the Sand village was a success, but then notices Gaara... who was off camera but <em>right</em> in front of him.
<ul><li> Happens twice in a row in the Wave Country Arc. While Kakashi and Zabuza are fighting on the bridge, Gatou suddenly appears with about thirty thugs, who've somehow managed to soundlessly climb up the side of the bridge and bunch together, while only being discovered when Gatou speaks. Maybe justified, as everybody was pretty busy at the time, and Zabuza's fog was lingering. But what is <em>not</em> justified is twice as many villagers showing up minutes later in direct view of the thugs, who don't see them until Inari shoots an arrow at them.
</li></ul></li><li> During the first fight between Hei and Wei in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hei puts his own blood on his mask to make Wei think that he was hit, and we then see Hei falling off of the building, with the camera behind him. Hei and Wei were facing each other, though, so Wei should have been able to notice that the blood on Hei's face didn't explode</span>.
<ul><li> In the second season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntellectualAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntellectualAnimal">Mao</a> was sitting on July's head when he disappeared, but didn't notice it until the camera showed him, whereupon he somehow also ended up on Kirihara's head.
</li></ul></li><li> It's implied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em> that if you can't see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Matoi</a>, it's because she's standing directly behind Nozomu. Every time she pops up in the middle of a scene to say something, they have this dialogue:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Nozomu</strong>: You were there? <br/><strong>Matoi</strong>: Yes, always.
</div><ul><li> Ai Kaga uses this to her advantage, she hides just outside the camera's view for the first 11 episodes to avoid ruining the show.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, Negi rides his broom up into an entirely clear sky and somehow didn't notice a swarm of flying robots until they were less than 30m away <em>and he was in the middle of them</em>.
</li><li> Happens several times in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ARIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ARIA">Aria</a></em>: a character will go into a flashback, and when it ends someone else will have joined the group with everyone suddenly surprised to find out they've been there for a while now.
</li><li> Taken to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a> in the Marineford arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> where neither the audience nor the armies of Whitebeard pirates and Marines notice <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blackbeard's crew, which includes a building-sized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">giant</a></span> until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marine HQ, the building they were hiding behind,</span> was destroyed.
</li><li> In the end of the first episode of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, a number of soldiers and a mecha sneak up on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichIdiotWithNoDayJob">Lelouch</a> <em>from the front</em>. Maybe because it was somewhat dark and Lelouch was distracted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif">Mysterious Waif</a> giving him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure">call</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, we get a close up of Hachigen's face so we can't see his arm <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is missing.</span> Somehow, Barragan fails to notice this until the camera zooms out even though he was looking at Hachiken this whole time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan">Haiyore! Nyarko-san</a></em> has an episode where Nyarko attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoke</a> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamAndEvePlot">Adam and Eve Plot</a> to get some sweet island lovin' out of Mahiro. Her plan is quickly derailed when the camera changes to reveal people and buildings...positioned immediately in front of Mahiro's field of vision. Granted, he wasn't going to fall for it anyway, given that Nyarko attempted this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">an indoor swimming pool</a>...
</li><li> Hilariously lampshaded in a promo chapter for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> movie, which concerned a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElevator">Space Elevator</a>, which would logically be highly visible from anywhere in the city, that had never before been mentioned.

</div></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValentinesDayEpisodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValentinesDayEpisodes">Valentine's Day Chapter</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, Akane is trying to give Ranma some chocolate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">which is a gift to him from a little girl Ranma helped.</a> She tries to do it on the roof for the sake of privacy, but after having a short conversation, they notice something: the roof was already <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">completely full</a></em> of different couples with a girl giving a guy chocolate, all apparently oblivious to each other.
</li><li> A minor example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team</a></em>, where, at one point during the battle against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Norris Packard</a>, Karen fires her mobile suit's chest-mounted Vulcan into empty space for at least three seconds, not realizing Packard isn't there anymore until the camera shows us.
</li><li> Parodied with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">Teacher</a> in <em>Eiken</em>, the Eiken club's chaperone whom Densuke never noticed until 11 chapters in because she's so unnoticeable.

The assassin is covered in a shawl, and when some of the X-corp branch unmask the assassin, it is only then that the Professor, several yards away, tells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> who it is. This is a telepath who should have been able to tell the other telepath who it was before the audience finds out.

In short, it seems as if Calculus drove all the way to the Moon rocket without either Tintin or Haddock apparently noticing it before they are parked almost below it.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3">Toy Story 3</a></em>, there's a scene where several of the toys have to cross to the other side of a garbage dumpster. In the DVD Commentary, the filmmakers point out the toys could have simply <em>walked around</em> the dumpster, so they had had to <em>very carefully</em> set the camera angles on each shot to prevent the audience from realizing that.

This includes over a dozen squad cars, <em>all</em> with lights going, that was taking place directly in front of them for the entire scene.

At one point, he cuts a hole in the bottom of a chest and drains its gold coins out. However, there are four guards holding the chest on their shoulders. Justified in that the guards are rhinos, and with their eyes set in the sides of their heads, their field of vision doesn't cover the area forward and down.

Then the camera turns and about forty police officers and National Guardsmen are right behind them with guns drawn. Jake, Elwood, and the clerk didn't see or hear them come in, despite the fact that they were the opposite of stealthy in the buildup scenes and would have had to break through the Blues's makeshift barricades. In the wide shot, <em>the clerk</em> (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>) is seen pointing a gun at the brothers from behind them.

Incredibly - and this is not supposed to be a comedy, as far as anyone can tell - the dinosaur then proceeds to slap him, and he raises his fists. Probably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">No Fourth Wall</a> moment, where the dino proceeds to do and say what everyone in the audience is thinking: "<em><strong>YOU DUMBASS!</strong></em>"

From the open doorway he was looking at, directly in front of him. He also managed to not see the three other people behind the first one, all walking towards the open door of the cabin.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardToKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HardToKill">Hard to Kill</a></em>, an assassin sent to kill Segal's character (who is in the hospital) is confronted by a guard demanding to know who he is. He turns to face the guard, as the camera pans down to reveal that he's holding a gun behind his back. This means he was holding the gun behind him when the guard was looking at his back, yet somehow he didn't see it.

The dead person's face is pointed right at him, but he has no reaction. Then when he shifts the body so that the viewer can see the horribly mutilated face (and the character can't) <em>that's</em> when he reacts to it.
<ul><li> Earlier there is a scene where the characters, who are walking on an abandoned street, don't see the small army directly behind them until a shot is fired and the camera turns around.
</li><li> Compounded by the fact that we, as the audience, don't hear either of these coming <em>either</em>.
</li><li> The monster scene may actually be slightly justified. The survivors had just suffered a horrific helicopter crash. They would've been physically and mentally disoriented, and it's likely their ears were still ringing. And if you listen very carefully, just before the attack, the camera mic (which also may have been damaged slightly) picks up the sound of it approaching.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em>, Steve walks out the front door, picks up the paper, reads it, looks to the neighbors to his left and right packing up, then when a helicopter flies overhead he sees the giant flying saucer that's been in front of him the whole time. You'd think it'd be the first thing he saw when he opened the door. To make things worse, Jasmine makes the same mistake, not noticing it until she sees he's staring at it. Partially justified since Steve was looking down most of the time, first just sleepily then after tripping over a toy left in the sidewalk. Jasmine was bringing Steve a brimming cup of coffee, so was likely watching that to make sure she didn't spill. The enormous size of the spaceship might have contributed. Not looking at it, sleepy, concentrating on other things ... big dark thing hanging over the city in the distance = "dark cloud".

The viewers cannot see the rock bridge because it's camouflaged against the rock wall of the chasm. But the viewers are watching a two-dimensional image; to the characters in the scene, anyone having binocular vision should be able to easily see the bridge, regardless of its paint scheme. (As a thought experiment, imagine the movie were converted to 3-D; that scene could never be made to work.) It also requires the person to be exactly the right height and standing in the exact middle of the ledge.

There's no boats, no parachute, nothing to indicate where he came from. The beach, the sea, and the sky are all perfectly vacant. They run at him to make him stop, and all of a sudden an entire landing force, complete with several amphibious vehicles and helicopters, appears spontaneously on the beach.
<ul><li> Earlier in the film, the characters somehow don't notice the Spinosaurus, which is quite large and standing in plain sight of at least half the party, until a satellite phone in its belly rings and gets their attention. Also strange because they could apparently hear the phone from quite a ways off, but somehow couldn't hear the sound of the twenty-something ton dinosaur coming at them.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">the first movie</a>, the T-Rex miraculously manages to come inside the Jurassic Park center, even though earlier T-Rex caused <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadVibrations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadVibrations">Bad Vibrations</a> in glass of water. Admittedly, they were a bit distracted by the Velociraptors that were trying to kill them.
<ul><li> Also, during the famous first scene when they first see the Brachiosaurus, they look around and see massive herds of dinosaurs that were roaming through areas that they had just driven through on the Jeep. How they didn't see them is unknown.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicWorld">Jurassic World</a></em>, one character complains that they haven't gotten to see a single dinosaur yet, only for the camera to turn around and show that they are, much to his delight, literally driving through a large flock.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LegendsOfTheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LegendsOfTheFall">Legends of the Fall</a></em>, Tristan (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a>) is in the woods looking at a dead animal.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergioLeone">Sergio Leone</a> loved this trope. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em> actually uses it as an informal "rule", with many examples. Hell, the opening shot of the movie features one, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> even noted several times. We see a wide, open landscape shot devoid of any signs of life. All of a sudden a guy moves into shot...in extreme close-up. Blondie and Tuco also fail to notice they're walking into a Union Army encampment and are ambushed by a dozen soldiers standing on the road.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LethalWeapon3">Lethal Weapon 3</a></em> has a scene where Riggs sees his partner's daughter appear to be in trouble. After breaking up the situation with reckless abandon, Riggs discovers that the entire incident was all part of a movie set. It's only after he makes a mess that he notices the entire camera crew nearby.

They crest a ridge, and Aragorn suddenly stops, wary. He signals, and he, Legolas, and Gimli run across the top of the ridge to hide behind a rock... and miss, by a matter of INCHES, being trampled by a huge freaking contingent of horses and riders that are coming over the hill. Okay, A) what, the keen-eyed elf didn't see them coming, and the ranger who can hear orcs ten miles away by putting his head to the ground didn't hear the horses' approach? B) What genius decides to hide by first running across the high ground? But that's okay, because C) it obviously worked, as the riders don't notice those folks that they just about ran over until they're several yards past... and then Aragorn shouts and that <em>instantly</em> gets their attention (over the noise of hooves, harnesses, tack, etc.). So many things wrong with that scene... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">it did look awfully neat though.</a>
<ul><li> In Tolkien's original they spot the riders from very far off already (five leagues by Legolas' estimation): Legolas can see them in detail while the others see a little blob, and Aragorn can hear them when listening to the ground. They consciously move down to the foot of the hill so as to not present an easily visible silhouette, sit huddled in their Elven cloaks, and have to <em>wait</em> for some time, during which they can discuss at length the people coming their way.

There is enough distance between them that Loki would be able to see the Hulk's whole figure (so Hulk couldn't make any move without it being seen).

The camera cuts to the soldiers who then reach the bottom and run down the hall. Cut to Jack hiding behind a table at the bottom of the stairs.

At this point, Frank asks Johnathan if he's the only one there and asks him if he's seen Gemma.

</li><li> During a mixdown of an album certain channels may be muted at different times to stop unwanted acoustic information from going to the master. Hearing "bleed-through" or muffled "off-mic" sounds is a result of the same sound being picked up by a different microphone during recording or electromagnetic interference in the multi-track heads.

<ul><li> In modern 3D games, a common trick used to save processing power is to prevent the game from rendering anything the player cannot directly see. This can range from not rendering anything in the world the player isn't directly looking at, to simply not modeling the right side of the first-person model for a weapon (and using a noticeably lower-quality third-person model for other characters to hold).
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatEmUp">Beat Em Ups</a> will hide extra lives and health pickups behind pipes. The character would clearly see it but the player's view is blocked by the pipe. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a> 3</em> has a few.
</li><li> A great deal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsometricProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsometricProjection">isometric</a> games, shot from a slightly slanted angle, will hide hidden characters or chests behind walls, staircases, or the like, waiting for an investigative player to find them.

You can walk around them all you like, but since their sprites always face forwards the player will never be able to determine which hamster is the right one until the main characters learn a Ham-Chat to make the hamsters turn around, even though they should clearly see it from their point of view.
</li><li> Many if not most light gun/rail gun shooters use this. No matter how well you're covering your position, mooks will appear right in your face and make it damned near impossible to avoid damage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LethalEnforcers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LethalEnforcers">Lethal Enforcers</a> is seemingly where this started, or at least became prominent.
</li><li> Inverted in some of the earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame">MMORPGs</a> (notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkAgeOfCamelot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkAgeOfCamelot">Dark Age of Camelot</a></em>) where a target is clearly visible on screen yet when you try to cast a spell on them it will say the target is not visible, presumably due to bad programming. <em>DAOC</em> is in third person so you could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> it by saying just because the camera can see the target doesn't mean your character in game can see it from their POV; <em>EverQuest</em>, however, is first person by default so has no such excuse. Most later MMOs with similar mechanics, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, sidestep the issue by wording it as the target being out of your character's line of sight, such as the target slipping behind a large tree or other piece of scenery.
</li><li> A lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp">Shoot Em Ups</a> have the rule of "if it's off-screen, you can't shoot it". In other words, you could be firing everything when the boss is about 100 meters away, but until the boss appears on the screen you can't damage it. Similarly, your movement is limited to what's onscreen; if you're at the edge of the screen and cornered by bullets, you simply can't move further off to the side.
</li><li> Occurs with offscreen-spawning enemies in FPS games. Conversely, they probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllSeeingAI">already know your position.</a> Some such games, such as the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>, even complain in the console when the player can see where the enemies are trying to spawn from. More recent ones that don't eschew infinitely-respawning enemies entirely often add in obvious entrances for enemies to spawn in behind then leave to enter the playing field proper, such as a tunnel entrance or a door that refuses to open for you.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> in all third-person shooters where the player can rotate the camera around the character and zoom out. This allows the player to see around corners, over obstacles, and other impediments to line of sight without needing to expose the character. Until the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraScrew">suddenly denies you camera control</a>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> upgraded to a slightly more realistic form. You can still turn the camera around to look behind objects, but you can no longer scan for objects using your mouse (which used to show enemies even through solid stone walls). You can, however, still use a keyboard command to show the lifemeters of all hidden enemies around you, including those below the floor you're on and behind walls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> gives you the opportunity to not just look but shoot blind around corners and over obstacles. The flipside of being able to do this is that that you have no accuracy, so firing an automatic weapon in this manner is a case of spray-n-pray.
</li><li> In turn-based games that keep track of what your character can see using fog of war, a <strong>four dimensional</strong> version of this can occur. Characters with enough movement points can pop out from cover, catch a glimpse of something, and return to safety all in the same turn. This often makes it impossible for other entities to react to or even SEE your character.
<ul><li> An especially vicious abuse of turn-based games is to perform an action (like taking a potshot at somebody) when you do this. Some editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> allowed heavily enhanced characters to open a door, run in, knife someone, run out, close the door, and lock it in a single turn.
</li><li> Some turn-based games, usually based in some kind of action point model, mitigate this. They use a mechanic, sometimes called overwatch, that allows to use left over action points from your own turn during the enemy's turn, usually as a reaction from detecting an enemy character doing the above.
</li></ul></li><li> The latest <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> installments take this to the logical next step. Aside from knowing what's around the corner without actually exposing Logan, you can now <em>pre-aim</em> shots from behind cover! This results in "peek-a-boo" headshots, where the agent will come out of cover, shoot the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mook</a> in the head, and duck behind cover in just half a second. Granted, this "pre-aiming" is only effective at close range and in a rather narrow angle of coverage - many situations need the manual aim which requires the player to come out of cover. Still, <em>Dark Mirror</em> and <em>Logan's Shadow</em> takes the omniscience of the third person camera to a whole new level. Also present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WinBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WinBack">WinBack</a></em>, which - when you sidle up to a corner - allows you to queue up multiple headshots for button-press execution.
</li><li> Some games have very simple cameras. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Oni">Oni</a></em> did not push the camera in or clip outside walls, so you could swing it right through walls and see all kinds of things (or block your view with the other side of the wall Konoko's backed up against!). Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> didn't fix this bug with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloCombatEvolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></em>'s 3rd-person vehicle camera, it might be the reason why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> became an FPS.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a> Zero</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a>: Vegas</em> switch to a third person view when you're in cover, and you can pre-aim from here. Like <em>Syphon Filter</em> above, however, you need to actually pop out of cover to properly aim and hit enemies; outside of abusing a glitch with sniper rifles in the second <em>Vegas</em>, attempting to blind-fire from behind cover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">only works at extreme close range</a>. <em>Vegas</em> also has camera issues, since the game always wants to view the action when you're leaning up over low cover from a specific angle depending on which direction you're aiming from that cover - the problem being that whichever angle it wants is always the one that blocks your view of who you're actually trying to shoot at with your own body.
</li></ul></li><li> Many games with top-down views, such as the older <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> games and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>, have "secret doors" that are only not visible because of the bird's-eye view the player has.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the Harvest Festival, a turkey named Franklin, concerned about whether he was invited to <em>have</em> dinner or to <em>be</em> dinner, hides in different locations in your town... but always to the north of buildings. Sometimes that building is in the acre <em>just south of the Wishing Well, where the festivities are being held.</em> Anyone attending would have a good chance of seeing him.
</li><li> In <em>City Folk</em> and <em>New Leaf</em>, sometimes townsfolk will want to play hide-and-seek with you when you talk to them. When this is happening, you have a set time limit to find him/her and one or two other people somewhere in the town outside of buildings. They generally hide behind buildings and trees, where the player would not be able to see very well in many cases because of the overhead view, even though the character would probably be able to see them in the first person.

Batman rescues a criminal late in the game, who stands there musing to himself about the irony. The player must then guide Batman to hack through a locked door right next to him. The games mechanics has the camera zoom in over Batman's shoulder to show his concentration on hacking. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">criminal</a> will attack you, but only as long as he isn't in the same camera shot as Batman.

In order to progress through the game, you must open an exit by pressing a switch on one side of the column in the center of the room (the game has a top-side view). Inside the room is also a human skeleton holding a note commenting about how he just can't find the exit. So, basically, this guy <em>died</em> because he couldn't find the super-stealthy-hidden-secret switch.

In a number of dungeons/castles/towns/etc., the character (if he knows to look for it or accidentally just walks into the right wall) will find a hidden passage. Many of the final weapons for the characters are found this way at the end of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> has these same hidden passages, but one of the abilities characters can learn actually lets the player see them as well. Apparently only thieves are capable of noticing gaping holes in walls that run North-South.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar">God of War</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Very few of the things in the series that are "hidden" would be hidden to Kratos. They're just hidden from the player by the camera angles. A particularly ridiculous example is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarIII">God of War III</a></em>, where Kratos somehow didn't notice Kronos until he picked him up, despite the titan being several hundred feet tall, shaking the ground with each step, being neither camouflaged nor concealed behind anything and generally being completely impossible to miss if Kratos had simply looked to his left.
</li><li> Because there's no way to control the camera, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">any enemy that you can't see can't attack you.</a> And yes, it is possible to use this tactically by deliberately keeping troublesome enemies out of your vision.
</li><li> Part of what made the Hades level in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI">the first game</a> so frustrating was that it wasn't always clear which rotating walkways you had to use to proceed, or which ones led to platforms with power-ups, so you had to test some out that went nowhere. Kratos <em>should</em> have been able to see where to go.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> game, a bad guy once comes out of hiding from behind a big floating ball of light. Floating. It's unclear how high up it is, but the PC standing right in front of it should definitely have seen at least his feet. There are also some examples of invisible doors on the north of buildings in semi-aerial view.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> RPG <em>MS Saga</em> does this in the city of Eisengrad, where there are "secret pathways" that let you get on top of the buildings and find hidden items. These paths are hidden from the player by foreground elements that block one's view of the road, but would be in full view of the protagonist if the game were done in first person.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> series tries to stay in a player-controlled first person POV whenever possible. In the commentary, the devs reveal that they sometimes have to work hard to manipulate the player into looking at an important plot point or visually impressive event.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IllusionOfGaia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IllusionOfGaia">Illusion of Gaia</a></em>, Will climbs a set of stairs and walks towards the camera, past a pillar. But wait! On the side of the pillar facing the stairs is a man carrying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupon</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a>! And you can't come back here later in the game to get it... If you're paying attention, though, you can see this guy scurry behind the pillar as the camera scrolls up to the new room.
</li><li> During one of the flying segments of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarusUprising">Kid Icarus: Uprising</a></em>, two Monoeye enemies move in front of the screen, and Pit yells at the to get out of his way. Even though the Monoeyes were behind Pit and wouldn't have been hindering him at all; it only hurts the player. This would not be the first time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">Pit comments on something that hinders the player and not him</a>; it's also hinted that they're blocking the line of sight of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>, meaning they can't steer his flying.
</li><li> Arguably the solution to a puzzle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVAbsenceMakesTheHeartGoYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuestVAbsenceMakesTheHeartGoYonder">King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder!</a></em>: in order to hide from some desert bandits, the player has to position King Graham behind some nearby rocks. It's not impossible for the bandits to fail to look to the side as they enter the cave, but there are places you can stand that will succeed while being clearly untenable in-universe (for example, sticking out halfway from one end.)
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestIIVohaulsRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestIIVohaulsRevenge">Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge</a></em> has pretty much the exact same puzzle, but the cover (a jungle tree) is much larger and therefore it works a bit better.
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestITheSarienEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuestITheSarienEncounter">Space Quest I: The Sarien Encounter</a></em> has the same puzzle again. The machine you hide behind is fairly skinny, but it's also pretty far up the screen, and the guards come by in the foreground.
</li></ul></li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfLegaia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfLegaia">Legend of Legaia</a></em> games, when entering a new dungeon, you'll often see cutscenes giving a general idea of its layout, or the dungeon boss gloating, or other scenes of that nature. These scenes incidentally occasionally reveal treasure chests and side-passages (which lead to more chests) that you might otherwise miss due to the limited camera.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LEGOAdaptationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/LEGOAdaptationGame">LEGO Adaptation Games</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>/etc...) love to hide things <em>just</em> out of normal camera range. You can wiggle the camera a little bit to see some of them, but a lot are completely hidden.
</li><li> In the Western chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LiveALive">Live A Live</a></em>, the hero and his rival are about to duel... and as they turn around they only turn 90 degrees and shoot two gang members who were hidden by the trees at the bottom of the screen, totally invisible to the player, but totally visible to everyone there.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformGame">Platform Games</a>, it pays to check whether the screen scrolls even when that seems unlikely. Pharaoh Man's stage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">Mega Man 4</a></em> is the best example: you're supposed to drop down the hole after the desert section, but if you try walking off the right side of the screen instead, you find more desert (leading to a secret item). Naturally, from Mega Man's perspective, this would be obvious.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> games are even sneakier, taking advantage of the fact that your movement through a stage is usually left-to-right; one capsule in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6">X6</a></em> is "hidden" off the left side of the screen when you teleport in.
<ul><li> Since X can cling to walls, his games do this on the vertical plane as well. What may look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPits">Bottomless Pit</a> for the player may actually lead to a secret chamber below, hidden only by the screen's limits (but which should be obvious from X's point of view). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX1">first game</a> did go out of its way to teach this to the player in its introductory stage, but then goes all out on abusing this as early as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2">X2</a></em>, where X needs a helmet upgrade to point out a "secret path" down a pit that he should clearly be able to see into.
</li><li> Similar with one of the sub-tanks and the entrance to Wire Sponge's level.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZero">Mega Man Zero</a></em> games are particularly fond of hiding things behind foreground layers.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManZX">Mega Man ZX</a></em> series does this also, but gives Model P and Model L special abilities to help find such items.
</li><li> Cyberworld areas in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> series are seen from overhead, but there's no movable camera since battles don't take place there. This allows Capcom to hide items and secrets on lower paths so that the upper paths block your view — and man, they <em>love</em> to do it. These items are staring MegaMan.EXE in the face as he walks by, but he won't say a word; your only hint is if you get him stuck behind an item.
<ul><li> Also done in the real world, which uses parts of the foreground to hide a background. In 3, there is a hidden speaker that you can jack into, containing a memory up, in the zoo. It's hidden under a ceiling so you would only know it was there by going to the right spot and pressing "A", rather than movement impediment. This is done more times throughout the games. These are easier to spot because the areas that you can't see are smaller so you can just check them, as opposed to online where there are many overlapping roads.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A few times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear2SolidSnake">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearGhostBabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearGhostBabel">Ghost Babel</a></em>, Snake has to identify a female soldier, but due to the eight-bit graphics he's incapable of recognizing her as being, well, the only woman on the base. In the case of <em>Ghost Babel</em>, he persuades the woman to give him some way of identifying her:
<div class="indent"><strong>Chris</strong>: How about my hairstyle? I have long hair tied up at the back. <br/><strong>Snake</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">But even amongst the mercenaries there are heaps of guys with long hair.</a>
</div></li><li> Several times in the text games, Snake can't recognise someone's voice due to it only being written down - such as with Gray Fox's and Big Boss's taunting at the end of <em>Metal Gear 2</em>. In turn, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, he can't identify the voice of his <em>best friend</em>, due to this being the first game in which Fox had a voice actor.
<ul><li> The latter is justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">The Twin Snakes</a></em>, as Fox's voice acting was changed to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone">Creepy Monotone</a> with robotic filters and some distortion, making it more understandable that Snake didn't recognize the voice right away.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a hint Pliskin gives you during the bomb-defusal early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em> which seems to indicate that the top-down third-person view the player has had since the beginning of the series is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaProp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaProp">actually how player characters in this series see the world</a></em>.
</li><li> At about the halfway point, Pliskin's helicopter (and then two minutes later, Solidus' Harrier) pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye">Stealth Hi/Bye</a> on Raiden due to being hidden behind the boundaries of the screen. It's subtly done, but in the director's commentary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a> points out that even though Raiden isn't looking at it, the noise real helicopters make is immense, and he'd be able to hear it for miles away. Of course, in game, we only hear it once we can see it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUGEN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUGEN">M.U.G.E.N</a></em>: One of Team S.M.R.T.'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Homer Simpson's</a> intros is that he appears to be shirtless and buff, before his "muscular body" turns out to be a cardboard prop that falls down. As a side-scrolling fighting game, the angle could fool <em>the player,</em> but <em>the opponent(s)</em> should clearly be able to see Homer standing side-by-side with his prop body, instead of behind it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySimsKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySimsKingdom">MySims Kingdom</a></em>, the group is proceeding to Morcubus' castle, and is almost there when they almost run into a billboard advertising cookies. Buddy even wonders how they missed it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiraOni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiraOni">Nira Oni</a></em>: One of the dolls the player needs to find in order to do the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Perfect Ending</a> is hidden on a secret passage in a random hallway that is easily missable and nigh-impossible to find in-game, but that should be easily visible to the main character in-universe. One of the puzzles also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this by telling the player to "go straight to the right", which, when complied, reveals a secret passage that'd be impossible to find in the game itself, but that would be one of the very first things the protagonist would see once he entered the room.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Oddworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Oddworld">Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee</a></em> and its sequel <em>Abe's Exoddus</em> have entrances to secret areas hidden behind foreground scenery. The 3D <em>Munch's Oddysee</em> and <em>Stranger's Wrath</em> dropped this, for obvious reasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">The Sinnoh games</a> contain a "secret" entrance to Wayward Cave which is only hidden because it's under a cycling bridge and you have an aerial view. To make this even weirder it's apparently even unnoticeable to <em>characters within the game</em>, which seems to indicate that <em>everyone</em> sees with an overheard view.
</li><li> Again in the Sinnoh games, the caves at the centre of the region's lakes are considered to be myths, which can only be explained by everyone having the same top-down view as you, since this top-down view hides the caves from sight until you're Surfing in the center of the lakes, while a proper first-person view would mean they're <em>easily</em> noticeable even from the shore.
</li><li> Lots of people get stuck on <em>HeartGold</em> and <em>SoulSilver</em>'s lighthouse. From an aerial view, you probably would not notice the open window you're supposed to drop through. From a first-person view though... well, it is the only open window in the lighthouse. Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">one might not want to go outside the window of a tall lighthouse</a>, even in a game where the player themselves are never in danger of injury.
</li><li> In a rather unnerving section of the Sea Mauville area in the 3DS remakes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>, the player can read a tattered notice stating that an "Odd Keystone" is missing. If the player opens a menu that covers the upper screen (maybe to check whether or not they have picked up this "Odd Keystone") when the menu has been closed, said keystone has materialised behind them and is revealed to be the Pokémon; Spiritomb, which promptly attacks the player.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1">Prince Of Persia 1</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2">Prince of Persia 2</a></em>, there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipScreenScrolling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipScreenScrolling">no scrolling</a>, so the camera suddenly shifts to adjacent rooms once the prince moves past the edge of the screen. Naturally, this is rife with opportunities for running into traps that the prince should see right in front of him but the player cannot.
<ul><li> The SNES version of the first game even has false walls in many levels (usually concealing valuable items), though because of the tilted z-axis to simulate depth, false walls that must be approached from the right really do look solid from the player's perspective.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLayton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLayton">Professor Layton</a></em> games play with this by having characters who use the black edges of the DS screen to hide, such as Hazel in <em>Unwound Future</em> and Goosey in <em>Last Specter</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectXZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectXZone">Project X Zone</a></em> just loves hiding chests and destructible items behind level geography. Fortunately, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpritePolygonMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpritePolygonMix">the stages are 3D environments</a> and you can wiggle the camera just shy of a quarter-turn from the default isometric angle, it's not too hard to scout each arena thoroughly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>'s camera is known for this. Some areas have cameras in odd angles that result in items and enemies being hidden from the player. Even if, say, it's a giant mutated zombie right in front of the player character two feet away, the camera makes sure it's hidden.
<ul><li> It leads to great, fear-inspiring atmospheric affects. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em>, for example, the player must head directly <em>towards</em> the camera, thus obscuring the character's actual view. When it switches to behind the player, you are treated the sight of a window and a scary creepy thing (shortly revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">Licker</a>) crawling by right outside the window!
</li><li> Also worth noting that while enemies off camera are hidden from the <em>camera</em>, they are not hidden from the <em>character.</em> The auto-aim will easily pick up and track threats off camera, and in most games the character will turn his or her head to look at something important.
</li><li> In one part of the B scenario, you turn on a security monitor, revealing that Tyrant has entered the room, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraAbuse">smashes the camera</a>.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> with Mendez in the cutscene preceding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> with him.
</li></ul></li><li> In the demo for the 2008 game "Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis," the game developers needed to ensure that Watson remain near to the player at all times. Rather than have him follow along by walking, they leveraged this trope by causing him to stand still until he was outside of the player's line of sight, then instantly teleport to the player's side. The result was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13YlEPwOfmk">decidedly creepy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, as the player could back away from a distant Watson, then rotate 180 degrees to find him standing at their side.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Done on purpose when the camera switches to show you the second half of a hallway you suddenly realize you are standing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWasRightThereAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWasRightThereAllAlong">right next to Pyramid Head</a>.</em>
</li><li> Another instance in the same area, at some point you go onto the roof, which is wide open and almost completely empty. After finding the door is locked, you walk up to a fence on the side (with the camera pointing right at it) only to be assaulted by Pyramid Head who wanders in from just off screen.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SineMora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SineMora">Sine Mora</a></em> are just off screen until you fight them, and most of those bosses are enormous mechanical ships that the pilots absolutely would've seen beforehand.
</li><li> Used for a lot of the secret items in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleCrashers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleCrashers">Castle Crashers</a></em>. One even requires you to go "behind the black" with a certain animal before you can get the sword.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> Used once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy">Sonic Advance</a></em>. After the fight with Mecha Knuckles, Eggman is revealed to have been just to the right of where the fight took place. The second he gets scrolled on-screen, he panics and drops the level's animal capsule.
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuvwJVYrxXY&amp;t=26s">one cutscene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a></em>, Dr. Eggman is standing alone, in the middle of a large window. There is nothing in view that could possibly be hiding a person. Sonic asks Eggman where Princess Elise is; the camera zooms in on Eggman, and without moving from his position, he pulls Elise into view from just off-camera.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowComplex">Shadow Complex</a></em> absolutely loves this one, for hiding items. A lot of items are simply hidden from the player behind pipes or whatnot, but, given that it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> sidescrolling platformer, these should be completely visible to the protagonist.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> has had to do this a couple of times in games with sequels; the standout example is <em>Alpha 3</em>, with the debut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Gundam SEED</a></em>. What are we told when a colony cluster full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Designer Babies</a> seemingly springs into existence? "It's always been there, we just never had any reason to pay it any mind."
<ul><li> The <em>Alpha</em> series also does this with series that leave and return; for example, the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Dancougar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Dancougar">Dancougar</a></em> explained their absence in <em>Alpha 2</em> by saying they had been assigned to a different front during that particular war.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage">Streets of Rage</a></em> series have enemies that can cheaply hide off screen or be half exposed on the screen border and yet the player cannot hit them even though the character can clearly see them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em>, Fuma, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja">Highly Visible Ninja</a> uses the camera to hide from the player.
</li><li> Occurs quite often in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> Due to processing limitations, if you can't see an object, it pretty much doesn't spawn or move. You can use this to your advantage if you jump on a Koopa and make its shell move around by moving so far the shell leaves your view, then going back - the shell will be gone.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> uses the trope literally, the whole game being styled like that of a stage play, to hide a secret warp whistle behind the third level's end.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>, as Mario is literally two-dimensional and must consciously move into the third dimension to find hidden goodies and avoid certain obstacles.
</li><li> Shows up a few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mushroom Kingdom proper has an NPC standing up against the northeast wall of a building... which, thanks to the game's perspective, renders him completely invisible. Fortunately, he's more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a> than anything else, as he'll only make meaningless comments about recent events if you manage to talk with him.
</li><li> Far more evil is the secret entrance to Marrymore Chapel, which is located on a wall that faces northeast. When you first show up in the level, the bad guys lock the front door, so you have to either walk around the chapel and press yourself against every wall or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">read the strategy guide</a> to proceed.
</li><li> Fun, yet sadistic, example: Trampolines are scattered throughout the world of the game. Jumping on them generally launches you to a new area. There are even trampolines indoors—the new areas they launch you to have holes in the floors that you jump up through. By the time you've gotten used to the idea that every trampoline has a hole in the ceiling above it, you come across one in the Moleville Mines that, when used, sends you crashing violently into the ceiling and knocks you unconscious so the recurring minor villain can rob you blind. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">Naturally, you have to jump on this sooner or later.</a>
</li><li> The sunken ship features a room with a three-dimensional maze in which, due to the game's isometric view, Mario is completely invisible to the player, making it one of the most challenging platforming moments in the game. The room is skippable, provided that you already know the password to reach King Calamari.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupremeCommander">Supreme Commander</a></em> is an RTS with a massive scale. In the single-player campaign every mission starts in a relatively small area, and then the map expands as the mission progresses. In almost every mission this will reveal that the strategy you were using is totally inappropriate given the new info. Also, enemy units can fire from unrevealed parts of the map; your own units cannot fire back, even though they should be able to see them a few yards away.
</li><li> The Syndicate games involve the agents going into buildings. This game is shot from a bird's eye view above. The game designers thought it would be great to not make the roof disappear so you can actually see what's going on. This results in you just blindly clicking commands for your agents to randomly stumble around the building.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> has at least one "hidden passage" that works like this. It's a tunnel that runs through a wall. The overhead camera can't see it at all, but the characters on the ground should be able to. (A semisecret dialogue lampshades it. Lloyd has a line that amounts to "What kind of secret passage was that?")
</li><li> Averted in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu">Tenchu</a>: Stealth Assassins</em> game, which despite having a third person viewpoint has a camera which is actually pretty good at only letting you see what your character could realistically see from where he/she is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>:
<ul><li> Early on, Toriel asks the player to walk to the end of the room by themselves, running ahead. When you reach the end of the room, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">she reveals that she did not leave you, and was in fact behind a convenient pillar the whole time</a>. But from the main character's perspective, they should have been able to see her (not to mention they should have seen her walk up to and hide behind it in the first place).
</li><li> The last puzzle in the Ruins revolves around this trope. You walk through the same room four times, seeing it from a different angle each time, and each angle reveals to the player a sign telling which switch to press. The room also contains some pillars next to the switches, which hide them from certain angles, so you have to memorize the room's layout and rotate it in your head to figure out where the switch the sign asks you to press actually is.
</li><li> A similar thing happens at the beginning of Snowdin, when the player character hides behind a Conveniently Shaped Lamp to hide from Papyrus. The lamp is a pixel-perfect silhouette match for the player character, but since Papyrus (unlike the player) is not viewing the scene directly from the south, he should be able to <a class="urllink" href="http://flavor-text-chara.tumblr.com/post/144717670540/intermission-comic-3">see the player character standing next to the lamp<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Sans's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepiecePrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepiecePrank">Eyepiece Prank</a> <em>inverts</em> this. There's no logical way the player character should be able to tell that the "premium telescope" has left a red circle around their eye, but the player can see it just fine. Since Sans is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallObserver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallObserver">Fourth-Wall Observer</a>, this makes a strange sort of sense.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntitledGooseGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntitledGooseGame">Untitled Goose Game</a></em> relies on this as something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">Anti-Frustration Feature</a>. While characters continue to move around and interact with their surroundings even when off-screen, they can't seem to see the goose when off-camera. This can even amount to you manually zooming out the camera and immediately being spotted by a villager as they enter the screen, even though you and them never moved. Since all characters can outrun the goose and you have no defense against them save for the wimpy kid who you can intimidate, it makes sneaking easier since you know you're out of view if they're off-camera.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">zOMG!</a></em>. When Old Man Logan points out the Windmill to the player, the player replies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">they can only see one screen's worth of scenery at a time</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsurasWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsurasWrath">Asura's Wrath</a></em>, A lot of the intermission slideshow images have things hidden outside the immediately visible area which can be viewed by panning the images.

More precisely, he actually <em>lives</em> back there, on-set but off-screen. 'Cos, you know, the set is all that <em>really</em> exists in a video.
<div class="indent"> <strong>The Nerd:</strong> Why are you always behind my damn couch anyway?!

</li><li> Also, the trope name itself refers to the fact that the website is a flash player surrounded by black background.
</li><li> The email "shapeshifting" had a case where a selective camera angle kept the Cheat from noticing that Strong Bad's attempt to morph into the King of Town left him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">only the right half of the King of Town</a> until he turned around.

The first attempt was unsuccessful because there weren't any clouds out in the sky. The second attempt is exaggerated, as it doesn't work because he does it in the daytime. Of course, both of these conditions aren't seen by the viewer until the camera cuts to the sky in both attempts.
</li><li> When Donnie Dupre of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DemoReel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DemoReel">Demo Reel</a></em> hunts down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobPaulsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobPaulsen">Rob Paulsen</a> to get him to sing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Yakko's World</a>, Donnie starts backing up down a hallway with the camera facing him, he declares that he will find Rob Paulsen.

<ul><li> Humorously used in episode "The Third": Darwin is looking at his reflection in a window, sees what he thinks is Gumball's reflection, turns around, and stares offscreen for several seconds until Gumball points out that he's <em>not there</em> but rather outside, on the opposite side of the window.
</li><li> Whether the characters see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperPeople">Teri</a> in full or as a nearly invisible line is based on her visibility to the audience, even when the character's position should give them a line of sight perpendicular to the audience's.
</li><li> Played with in "The Recipe", when Gumball and Darwin hide the clone they made of Anton from the real deal. After he leaves they say how lucky they were that Anton didn't notice, only for Anton to reveal that just because he was out of sight, doesn't mean he was out of earshot.
</li><li> Played straight in "The Boredom". The Moon thinks it's right next to the Sun when they look that way to the viewer. Only after it cuts to an astronomical view does she realize they're 93 million miles apart.
</li><li> In <em>The Fuss</em> Nicole and the kids rush to prevent Richard from getting a tattoo of the date because she'd been guilting him over it, thinking it was their anniversary. Problem is at this point the screen is split between their race to the tattoo parlor and Richard getting his tattoo, and they can't see anything cropped by Richard's side of the screen.
</li><li> Gumball and Darwin try talking to Masami in <em>The Gift</em> to get an idea of a present she'd like without letting her know they don't have one. When she tells them and leaves, it's revealed that everyone else who was invited was eavesdropping when the camera pulls back and shows they were framing the screen.
</li><li> The most outstanding example has to be in <em>The Factory</em>. It has the boys stowaway in Nicole's briefcase, which Gumball hands to her from <em>within</em> the briefcase, and somehow she didn't notice that her briefcase was floating to her carried by an arm sticking from inside it because the camera angle didn't show that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity">at first</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> when Stan and Steve talk about the current plot in the living room. Francine interjects with a comment as the camera zooms out to show her standing in the doorway. Stan questions how he was completely unaware she was there despite him having a perfect view of the doorway from his present position. When the camera zooms back in to Stan and Steve, Stan starts a sentence, but squints back towards the doorway, as though he's trying to tell if Francine is still there.
</li><li> Stan masters the art of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye">Stealth Hi/Bye</a>, which works even when people are looking <em>right at him</em>, so long as he's just outside the frame. Gets spoofed when he tries it after being psyched out by a car salesman, only for the "camera" to pan over and show him with his head stuffed into the mailbox as he laments that he can't even vanish mysteriously anymore.
</li><li> Roger has a similar version of this ability, being able to change his disguises so fast that all it takes is for the camera to do a closeup on the person talking to him, and when it goes back to a wideshot said person is shocked to find Roger wearing an entirely different outfit.
</li><li> In the episode "With Friends Like Steve's" Stan runs a fingerprint test on his home computer. When the results come up on screen, the shot's positioned in such a way so that Stan's head blocks the portion of the screen saying whose fingerprints they were. Stan then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">comments</a> that all he needs to do now is move his head so he can see the other side of the screen, and only <em>then</em> does he react to the information displayed.
</li><li> In "Joint Custody", Stan doesn't realize Jeff's standing next to him in the shower.
</li><li> In "Bahama Mama" Stan gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidlifeCrisisCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidlifeCrisisCar">Mid-Life Crisis Car</a> out of nowhere. When Francine asks where he got it, he tells her he bought it at Offscreen Automotive...which adjoins their yard.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Chowder">Chowder</a></em> once featured Chowder and Panini hiding behind the same dumpster, alternating which side they were on, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">not noticing each other until the camera shifted behind the dumpster</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken">Cow and Chicken</a></em> revealed on few occasions that Mom and Dad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">have no upper parts</a>, but for most time the camera only showed them from waist down, or the rest was obscured by something in the foreground. However, they must have clearly been exposed to everyone else in the show, and somehow nobody had any problem with two pairs of legs walking around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> in one episode Brian and Stewie enter the house discussing and they only notice Lois and Peter completely naked and stoned on the couch in the middle of the room when the camera reveals them.
</li><li> An inversion occurs when Stewie rips open the belly of a horse to warm himself <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> style. The camera then zooms out and a group of kids is watching the scene. They suddenly all gasp at the same time at the shocking view that they've had in front of them for 10 seconds.

</div></li><li> Parodied in the very first episode. Bender's (robot) arms fall off, and the camera zooms in to show him putting his own arms back in place...conveniently hiding the impossibility of this—how did he use a detached arm to pick up and attach his other detached arm?—off the edge of the screen.
<div class="indent"><strong>Fry:</strong> I don't know how you <em>did</em> that!

<ul><li> Episode 7a, "Weighty Problem", plays with this a bit. Jon wants to jog west, while Garfield wants, though only "wants" in the loosest sense of the word, to jog east. Jon assumes it's because it's shorter, and jogs off... promptly discovering the <em>real</em> reason when he falls down an open manhole.
</li><li> Episode 9 of <em>Orson's Farm</em>, "Keeping Cool", has Bo trick Orson's brothers by inviting them to play tug-of-war against him and Orson. We then see Orson's brothers with the rope tied tightly around them, facing offscreen and taunting Bo... who then emerges from behind them and reveals that he had tied his end of the rope to the cross-town bus.
</li></ul></li><li> The fourth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldOriginals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldOriginals">Garfield Originals</a></em> had Nermal attempt to wake up a sleeping Garfield, only to find that it was just a cardboard cut-out set up by the real Garfield.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>: The <em>Dipper's Guide to the Unexplained</em> short "Lefty" is about a person who has only ever been seen from the left by anyone. This means that his left side was always facing the camera, even though other people in the scene should have been able to see him from the right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted. When Heloise is on a date with Peep in the movie theatre and Jimmy is sitting behind them and seething, Peep ducks under the chairs to raid them off gum. Heloise quickly pulls out a cardboard cutout of him and places him in the chair and pretends she's laughing at a joke he just told. Cue Jimmy's comment:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Jimmy:</strong> "Aw, even his cardboard cutout is funnier than me!"
</div><ul><li> Lampshaded in "Monster Mutt" when Cerbee!Beezy gets caught in a net by one of Lucius's helicopters. Beezy!Cerbee comments "you'd think we would have noticed that helicopter before".
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RabbitFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RabbitFire">Rabbit Fire</a>", after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy</a> duck into a rabbit hole to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElmerFudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ElmerFudd">Elmer</a>, Bugs pops up and says that using an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">Elephant Gun</a> to shoot at rabbits is unfair, and Elmer should go shoot at elephants. The camera pulls out to show an angry-looking elephant, who apparently came out of nowhere, is suddenly standing behind Elmer, warning him in no uncertain terms not to even <em>think</em> about it. This is generally just something Bugs can do. His antagonist will, thinking they got the better of him, turn their back on Bugs, only for Bugs to now be in front of him, ready for more, yet they never react until Bugs is on-screen, and often mutter to themselves for a moment or two before he appears.
</li><li> Lucy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em> often spooks her siblings in this manner.

Nobody notices the 80-foot tall robot is gone until they get to the sidewalk and Jamie points it out.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em> revealed that the opposite side of his father's study (the one the 'camera' would be in) contains a vast, obvious hallway covered in weaponry. Orel says he never noticed it before, and is given the response "It sort of blends into the woodwork."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Excited characters have the strange ability to stick their heads in from behind the black, often in positions where they would have to be hovering several feet above the ground. Nobody questions this. Pinkie Pie in particular takes this to ridiculous levels. At one point, it's subverted as she promptly falls down.
</li><li> Originally <em>only</em> Pinkie was able to do this. When other, generic ponies do it in "Winter Wrap Up", Rainbow Dash is definitely surprised by it.
</li><li> It's taken to a ridiculous extreme in "Call Of The Cutie" as an entire party appears out of nowhere while the camera is zoomed in on Apple Bloom's face.
</li><li> Done to a rather extreme in "Bridle Gossip" when Twilight and Spike first duck into Sugarcube Corner with Pinkie Pie. Twilight asks why she's sitting alone in the dark, to which Pinkie replies she isn't. At that, the camera zooms out to reveal all the other mane cast are also in hiding.
</li><li> In "Secret of My Excess" Spike is able to steal everything in Zecora's hut when the camera zooms in on her and Twilight, including a brewing pot <em>in front of them</em>.
</li><li> In "Baby Cakes", Pinkie Pie is looking at the new twins, and phases under the window. In this case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">the other ponies notice it</a>.
</li><li> In the 20th episode of season 2 "It's About Time" Twilight Sparkle fails to notice the entrance to the Star Swirl the Bearded wing of the Canterlot Library until Pinkie Pie points out that it is right next to them (just behind the viewer's point of view) right next to where they entered. Twilight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this by wondering how she could have possibly missed that, though to be fair she had been awake for almost 3 days.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E24EquestriaGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E24EquestriaGames">Equestria Games</a></em>, after melting the giant ice block, Spike pulls an umbrella from just below the bottom of the screen. He opens it to shield himself from the brief downpour, then puts it back where it was, below the bottom of the screen. The camera cuts to a wider shot of Spike in the middle of the field. There's no umbrella, and nothing it could possibly fit behind.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> episode "Nullzilla", Bob and his friends fail to notice the giant Null monster until Mike pointed it out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Two Bad Neighbors", Homer is surprised to find a house on his home street that he's never seen before. Bart promptly points out it's directly across the street from their own house. To be fair, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Homer</a> we're talking about.
</li><li> The idea behind the trope, that nothing happens if it's off screen, is lampshaded in one episode. When Homer leaves Moe's, Moe comments to the rest of the barflies that "Alright, Homer is gone, let's all go back to being perfectly still until he's back".
</li><li> In "How Lisa Got Her Marge Back", during the scene where Marge invites Lisa to watch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMusicalsAreAdaptations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMusicalsAreAdaptations">a musical adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBadNewsBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBadNewsBears">The Bad News Bears</a></em>, Lisa is holding some pamphlets for the performance in a way that blocks her neck from the viewers' perspective. Marge then offers Lisa some earrings she bought as a gift for her, but Lisa tells her she's not into jewelry at the moment, at which point she sets the pamphlets down, revealing she's not wearing her signature pearl necklace. Marge gasps in shock, even though <a class="urllink" href="http://68.media.tumblr.com/c2c658edffa965856b724a5612b5ec6b/tumblr_odh38odmcq1qh59n0o2_540.png">she's in a position where she can see Lisa's neck the whole time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> The episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS12E9HOMR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS12E9HOMR">"HOMR"</a> features a scene from the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Love Is Nice</a></em>. A priest is performing a wedding with a bride and a groom facing him. He says, "Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?" The camera moves to show a second groom on the other side of the bride, and the two grooms say in unison, "I do." The priest only just then notices the second groom and faints in his surprise.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> After Kenny is temporarily killed off in "Kenny Dies", he reappears without any prior explanation one season later in "Red Sleigh Down". Kyle asks where Kenny has been, to which Kenny replies, "Oh, I've just been hanging out." while pointing off screen.
</li><li> Played for laughs in the episode "The Coon", where Cartman is pretending to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman-like</a> superhero. When he enters the police station, the cops look away for a second, only for Cartman to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenTeleportation">disappear and show up behind them</a>. He then shows up in his original location. Then, he shows up a few feet to his left, with the cops apparently unaware until the camera pans to reveal him.
</li><li> Used in the episode "City Sushi", where Tuong Lu Kim (owner of City Wok) has failed to notice that a sushi restaurant has been built and opened right next door to his restaurant until Butters gives him a flyer for it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> :
<ul><li> Plankton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTheft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTheft">steals a Krabby Patty by replacing it with a cutout even though it was on-screen the entire time</a>, and Krabs fails to notice that it's a cutout until it falls over, even though the facade was only on the opposite side as him.
</li><li> A gag similar to the above happens in "Rock Bottom". SpongeBob places a cardboard cutout of himself next to a vending machine across the street from a bus stop to keep the bus from driving off without him. Even though the facade of the cutout is on the opposite side from the bus, it only notices that the cutout is not SpongeBob and drives off when it falls over.
</li><li> In another episode, SpongeBob suspects someone is following him (a jellyfish is, and two guys who want to sell stuff to him), and keeps turning around quickly to catch a glimpse of his pursuer. Each time he does, the jellyfish ducks behind a rock or other piece of scenery. The problem lies in that the camera perspective during this scene is always either behind SpongeBob or off to the side of him, and the jellyfish ducks out of the camera's view, which should leave it clearly visible from SpongeBob's angle.
</li><li> In "Bossy Boots", SpongeBob walks into the kitchen after having to take apart Krabby Patties to create salads (just a slice of tomato and lettuce). It takes him a minute to notice the grill is gone, even though he's been staring right at it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in "Dunces and Dragons"; when SpongeBob and Patrick get sent back in time, the medieval Princess Pearl advises her father, King Krabs, against executing them for sorcery due to them being foretold as heroes by a prophecy. Krabs doesn't know what prophecy she's referring to until she points out the series of enormous stained glass windows right above his throne, which had previously been hidden by the camera angle.
<div class="indent"><strong>King Krabs:</strong> How long has that been there?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E22StevenAndTheStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E22StevenAndTheStevens">"Steven and the Stevens"</a>, when the original Steven discovers his three time-clones are rebelling against him and forming their own band, he asks who's playing the drums despite the fact that he could've just looked up to see Amethyst playing them. But, of course, she hadn't been on camera in that scene yet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> has an interesting example. In "Betrayal" Terra sees Slade's reflection on a mirror, but when she turns around she can't see any sign of him. We're probably meant to believe that Slade simply left the room during the time it took Terra to turn her head, except that there is a <em>very</em> clear shot of Terra looking behind her while the mirror in front of her still shows Slade's motionless reflection.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>, humans are always shown with their faces offscreen. In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerryTales">Tom and Jerry Tales</a></em>, this allowed a <strong>tiger</strong> to stand on its hind legs in front of a crowd pretending to be the Mayor. Nobody noticed, until its painted-on 'suit' was washed away and it dropped back onto all fours.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhenDinosaursRoamedAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhenDinosaursRoamedAmerica">When Dinosaurs Roamed America</a></em> combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">Failed a Spot Check</a>, when a <em>Ceratosaurus</em> fails to notice an <em>Allosaurus</em> in broad daylight on an open plain until the latter lunges from off-screen and kills it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em> episode "The Smile Collector", nobody notices the giant sandwich crusher Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy has positioned over the grocery store until he points it out.

<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness">Conceptual or inattentional blindness<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where a person engaged in one or more attention-grabbing activities fails to see something which is also present, means for most humans, quite a lot of things are Behind the Black. Experiments on this concept have had experiment subjects fail to notice the sudden appearance of a gorilla, or in another experiment a clown on a unicycle, when they were focused on the other elements of the experimental videos.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>; an invoked form of this was used in traditional Japanese theatre in that you weren't supposed to pay attention to the black-clothed prop hands. This is where the stereotypical black ninja getup comes from, since the best way for a guy to hide is to pretend to be one of said stage hands, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">flip out and kill people</a>. This concept, used intentionally in a work, is called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaProp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaProp">Ninja Prop</a> on this site.
<ul><li> It was used very effectively in the stage production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> at the National Theatre. The daemons were represented by (rather beautiful) puppets, which were operated by black-clad puppeteers. In the scene where Lyra has to summon her Death, Pantalaimon's puppeteer stands up, removes his mask and announces that he is her Death.
</li><li> In stage productions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarHorse">War Horse</a></em>, the horse puppets are operated by puppeteers costumed to fit in with the cast. Even though it requires three of them to operate the puppets of the adult horses, after a while the audience simply stops seeing them.
</li><li> Long time bunraku puppeteers work while clearly visible. Audiences that are watching the play find them very easy to ignore, even though they're three times the size of the actors and looming over them. Less experienced workers do wear the all black costume to make themselves less visible.
</li><li> A combination of both the aforementioned tropes is Kankuro, one of the few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighlyVisibleNinja">ninja</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> who dresses like a traditional 'stagehand-style' ninja. And what's his specialty? He's a Puppeteer.
</li></ul></li><li> Any recorded program that features skits involving the changing of wigs, costumes, or hats. The live audience can see what's going on, but the cameras make sure the viewers at home can't. Same for some in-the-round plays, where you may see actors changing costumes or operating scenery/props in the darkness just off-stage, but you're supposed to pretend you don't. The play and musical <em>Vanities</em> subverts this trope by having the cast change costumes, makeup, and wigs (in some productions) in full view of the audience. With literal vanity desks, hence the name.
</li><li> Many magic tricks on television are blatantly made for TV only. In other words, if you were a live witness to it, you are most likely in on the trick. A lot of tricks involve mirrors positioned just perfectly for the camera angle. The worst are "levitation" tricks that barely allow the camera to look at the actual levitation (he's starting to float, time to view the audience's reaction!).
<ul><li> In one of those "Masked Magician" specials, the titular magician made a <em>tank</em> disappear. The trick was accomplished by covering the camera and then shifting it 20 feet to the right.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrissAngelMindfreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrissAngelMindfreak">Criss Angel Mindfreak</a></em>, the titular magician "walks on water", i.e. a piece of clear plastic suspended at water level. Everyone in the pool had to be in on it.
</li><li> When the magician David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty "disappear", he did it by putting the cameras and live audience on a giant Lazy Suzan and slowly rotated it while the Statue was hidden from their view by a curtain.
</li><li> A trick of Dynamo's involved stepping through a closed gate. The screen went up in front of him performing the trick, but his and the gate's shadow was still visible on the ground. Just when things got interesting there, though, the editor decided the audience should see what the spectators were doing at that moment.
</li></ul></li><li> Any time a magician tells you to "watch carefully" the item that's supposedly going to change, disappear, or whatever, it's to divert your attention from what they're doing Behind the Black.
</li><li> A lot of location filming carefully frames the shot to conceal objects that shouldn't be there, let's say for instance a production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> set in an authentic-looking Sherwood Forest - next door to a parking lot.
<ul><li> This is regularly seen with <em>anything</em> that has to do with the pyramids at Giza, whether fiction or documentary. Most often what the audience sees looks like <a class="urllink" href="https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/58e2a407c0e88d1a6a20066b/16:9/w_1279,h_719,c_limit/Pyramid%20of%20Giza%201.jpg">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. If the camera was in a different position, it would reveal <a class="urllink" href="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11228601.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/TMP_CHP_240917pyramid-_085gizaJPG.jpg">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
