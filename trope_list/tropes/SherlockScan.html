The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is a gentleman of the medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured: he holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second.

The detective mentions some fact about the person he's just met, something that is not immediately obvious and he has no way of knowing ("Quitting cigarettes appears to have been good for you", "How's the wedding planning going?", "You've holidayed in Italy recently"). The other character looks skeptical or surprised, then the detective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness">describes his reasoning from a set of minor clues</a> (state and style of clothes, marks on skin, tan, etc.) and consequent assumptions.
</p><p>This is often not connected directly to the main plotline, but just to show "This is how the detective's mind works, and yes, the detective is That Good." The obvious subversion is to play this out, then have the detective admit that he was told the fact, or else for the other person to insist the detective is utterly wrong.

In general, deductive arguments produce only trivial truths in a field like detective work, so induction is all you can use. Due to the laws of probability this means that a detailed scan should be extremely likely to err on a few details, but this almost never happens in fiction. You will, however, find that once a character begins a Sherlock Scan their vision magically adjusts to 20/20, so that they can pick up every visual clue and expound on it without an unsightly squint.
</p><p>A common parody of this is to have the detective note these details before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClueEvidenceAndASmokingGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClueEvidenceAndASmokingGun">drawing attention to the blindingly obvious clue</a>, or occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockCanRead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockCanRead">notes the obvious clue immediately</a>.

Serpico corrects him by stating he thinks it was done by one man, noticing that the wounds appear on closer inspection to have been caused by some kind of massive blade swung at incredible speed. Seeing that the bodies are all in the same state he guesses they were killed with the same kind of blade, and that it would seem unnatural to propose that more than one man exists who could handle such a freakish weapon. This is one of many clues that Serpico is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">far more competent than he pretends to be</a>.
</li><li> Occasionally done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>, such as the first episode, where Conan comes up with a different justification.
</li><li> Sherlock Holmes of <em>Meitantei Holmes</em> (released in the US as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SherlockHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SherlockHound">Sherlock Hound</a></em>) is able to ascertain where a client came from because he recognizes the mud on her shoes and where it comes from.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga">Vinland Saga</a></em>: Askeladd can read a man, can tell if a man is brave, cunning or a coward at a single glance, after living forty years of a wicked life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> has this in part two. The protagonist, Joseph Joestar uses this on and off by hiding it behind his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">goofy personality</a> When it comes to fighting he becomes a tactical genius and can gain an advantage from just scanning his surroundings and his enemies. He then takes it a step further by predicting what his enemies will say, throwing them off even further than before.

</li><li> Victorique, one of the protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Gosick">Gosick</a></em>, is about as close to actually being Sherlock Holmes as a teenaged girl in a frilly dress can be, and as such is naturally prone to Sherlock Scanning. Perhaps more impressively, she's also capable of making these kinds of deductions based on details reported to her secondhand by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">Watson</a>, Kujo (since she rarely leaves the library in which she lives). And she's <em>right</em>, despite all the potential for error in such a setup.
</li><li> Houtarou Oreki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hyouka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hyouka">Hyouka</a></em> has a knack for the Sherlock Scan. For example, in Ep. 3, he deduced that an upperclassman was illegally smoking in a club room, and used that information to blackmail him into giving them the materials they needed.
</li><li> L from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> is a master of this. He managed to deduce Kira's identity and nationality by just studying the psychology of the crime and the order of victims.
</li><li> Detective Ryo MacLean from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FAKE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FAKE">FAKE</a></em> has demonstrated this a few times. He just looks around a crime scene and can tell what happened by just a few clues lying around.
</li><li> Reiji in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KaraNoShoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/KaraNoShoujo">Kara no Shoujo</a></em> adaptation immediately deduces much about Touko's character on first meeting. Probably for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedAdaptation">compression</a>, as the trope was averted in the VN.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceHero">Science Hero</a> Hange Zoe manages to solve a murder within moments of happening upon the scene, picking up on several details all while acting the part of a hysterical, grieving friend. After being chased off by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCop">Military Police</a> already handling the investigation, Hange reveals the act was a ruse to check the murderer's hands for bruised knuckles — confirming his guilt and the robbery-gone-bad being a cover for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> to silence the victim because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">He Knows Too Much</a>. Furthermore, that <em>all</em> the victim's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore">fingernails were removed</a> prior to death proves he didn't break and his killers likely didn't get a single thing out of him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GamblingEmperorLegendZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GamblingEmperorLegendZero">Gambling Emperor Legend Zero</a></em>: In The Anchor gamble, Koutaro shows Zero a handful of coins he dumped out of his wallet, and then turns the camera away from the pile. Koutaro then grabs one of the coins, and asks Zero which of the coins is in his fist. Zero uses a myriad of clues to deduce that it wasnt a Japanese coin at all, but in fact an American coin, either a penny or dollar coin, that was hidden under the pile Koutaro showed him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zero then incorrectly guesses that it was a penny, when it was a dollar coin.

His scans include:
<ul><li> Identifying a particular guest of Ciel's party as Karl Woodley.
<div class="indent"><strong>Woodley:</strong> How do you know my name...!?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Oh, it's quite obvious from the rings adorning your fingers. Large diamonds of that size are mined in South Africa. And the unique round brilliant-cut of those diamonds is possible only with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">the latest polisher developed by the Woodley Company</a>. [...] Thus, if among the guests at Earl Phantomhive's dinner party, there is one individual wearing such rare rings, he is most likely to be president of the Woodley Company... you, Mister Woodley.
</div></li><li> Identifying Arthur as an author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">(while praising him for saving the Vicar his breath)</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jeremy:</strong> It's a simple feat to tell a person's occupations and such from their clothing and habits. First, you have a writer's callus on the middle finger of your right hand. And it differs from that of those who draw or paint.. in other words, it goes to show just how much you write. Next, that blue smudge on your sleeve. This can happen when laundering fabric to which coloured ink has adhered. And lastly... you have made a habit of noting on your cuffs with pencil story ideas as they strike you so they do not forget. <em>Pearl... India... Secret Room... Sign.</em> Only a writer would do something like that, hmm?
</div></li><li> The classic Holmesian "drunkard's pocketwatch" scan, combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoseKnows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNoseKnows">The Nose Knows</a>.

</li><li> A villainous example is used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mulan">Mulan</a></em>, when Shan-Yu's generals are able to figure out that the Imperial Army was waiting for them in a village merely by examining a doll Shan-Yu's hawk brought back.

From observing that she's a bunny cop in a meter monitoring outfit, he correctly deduces that she came to Zootopia with big dreams, but got shunted to a low position due to her status as a bunny and that she originally comes from a carrot farm. He also accurately predicts that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she will give up her dreams and go home</span>, though it's only temporary and not exactly for the reasons he anticipated.

<ul><li> In addition to putting it to its conventional use, Sherlock also weaponizes it, using it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDetailedFightNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDetailedFightNarration">meticulously plan</a> out how he will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">thoroughly beat the crap out of someone</a>. The fight is shown in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a> as he plans and then realtime when he follows through. Guy Ritchie calls this "Holmes-O-Vision".
</li><li> He also uses it on Mary Morstan (at her eager request). His observations are bang-on, though unusually, he does make a slight mistake in guessing the age of Mary's male pupil - rather than being eight years old, he's actually seven, but tall for his age - right down to the tan-line on her finger speaking of a prior betrothal. When he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">rather cattily</a> speculates that she broke off the engagement to find better prospects (i.e., Watson), she tosses her drink in his face. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turns out, the guy died before they could marry.</span> Earlier in the scene, when Holmes is alone at the table, it's implied that he suffers from hyper-awareness, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">and can't turn it</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">off</a></em>.
</li><li> Dr. Watson has been working with Holmes so long, he's picked up on the talent himself. Holmes invites him to examine a pocket watch as evidence, to which Watson accurately deduces the previous owner was a drunk and bought it second hand from a pawn shop.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesAGameOfShadows">sequel</a>, the Holmes-O-Vision fights are both derailed mid-follow-through. The first time, the assassin he's kicking the ass of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">gets a knife to his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">body armour</a>, forcing Holmes to improvise. The second time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed that Moriarty can do the same thing - and they both realize that Holmes is going to lose in a proper fight. Holmes ends up pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> and showing that Moriarty's scan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">has a fatal flaw</a></span>
</li><li> Once, when Holmes is put on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindfoldedTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindfoldedTrip">Blindfolded Trip</a>, he delivers a turn-by-turn account of the entire route his carriage took just based on various smells and jolts in the ride.
</li><li> There is a scene in the sequel where Sherlock and Mycroft banter by making astute observations about each other. Watson interrupts them by making a deduction of his own.

Unusually, Lynd does it back, realizing that Bond himself is likely an orphan, and went to Oxford on someone else's charity, "hence the chip on your shoulder".

Of course, the twist is that Abe is psychic and can gather information about objects simply by touching or being near them.
</li><li> A similar scene is done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungSherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungSherlockHolmes">Young Sherlock Holmes</a></em>, when a school-aged Watson transfers to a new boarding school and meets Holmes for the first time. Holmes deduces Watson's name, home county, father's occupation, and Watson's love of writing and pastries. He only gets Watson's name wrong (he guesses James instead of John) because he only saw "J. Watson" on Watson's luggage and decided to go with a common name starting with J (John would have been his second guess).
<ul><li> This is actually a reference to the fact that Doyle himself got Watson's first name wrong in some of the later stories, using James.

He's completely wrong, and someone else entirely walks in.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XxXReturnOfXanderCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XxXReturnOfXanderCage">Xx X Return Of Xander Cage</a></em> reprises it as Cage figures out he's being tested when a strange man sits by him at a village square and somehow knows Xander speaks English as he talks. Xander also notices a teenager wearing too expensive headphones, a woman running to a bus that won't leave for a while and a "cop" paying for a drink with foreign currency.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinDiesel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinDiesel">Vin Diesel</a> seems to enjoy these roles. Riddick starts off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack">Pitch Black</a></em> with a five minute Sherlock monologue, correctly deducing the types of passengers onboard the ship and (almost) the route that the ship is taking. He gets something similar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChroniclesOfRiddick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChroniclesOfRiddick">The Chronicles of Riddick</a></em>, accurately describing how the guards and mercs turned on each other before the former abandoned their posts to make it for the only spaceship even though he wasn't even in the room when all this happened, but then Riddick reveals that it was his original plan.
</li><li> Spoofed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BulldogDrummond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BulldogDrummond">Bulldog Drummond</a> parody <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bullshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bullshot">Bullshot</a></em> when our hero deduces from some oil on the grass about the kidnapping that's just occurred, even down to the vehicle used — failing to notice said vehicle abandoned in a nearby ditch until it's pointed out by his faithful manservant.
</li><li> Played straight and lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoadedWeapon1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoadedWeapon1">Loaded Weapon 1</a>.</em> When the detectives are talking to Dr. Leecher, he does a brief Sherlock Scan on Colt and appears to do it to Luger too... until he admits he saw a family photo in Luger's wallet.
</li><li> Jason Bourne, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSeries">The Bourne Series</a></em>, has this as part of his abilities, demonstrated in a diner when he was talking with Marie Kreutz.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bourne:</strong> I can tell you the license plate numbers of all six cars outside. I can tell you that our waitress is left-handed and the guy sitting up at the counter weighs two hundred and fifteen pounds and knows how to handle himself. I know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside, and at this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking. Now why would I know that? How can I know that and not know who I am?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoolhallJunkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoolhallJunkies">Poolhall Junkies</a></em>, Johnny deduces that Mike is a pool player by the crease in his pants, citing that it's at the height of a pool table so is likely caused by either pool or bad dry cleaning, and sensing that Mike is rich, Johnny doesn't suspect he gets bad dry cleaning. He then admits to noticing blue chalk.
</li><li> This is how Flynn Carsen gets his job in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLibrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLibrarian">The Librarian</a></em> — he scans his boss, determining that she was recently divorced from the depth of the ring-line on her finger and noting that she had three cats by being able to tell their hairs apart on her jacket. He occasionally does this to other characters as well.
</li><li> In Jackie Chan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShanghaiKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShanghaiKnights">Shanghai Knights</a></em>, our heroes meet police constable Artie Doyle, who claims to have developed this method of deduction. At the end of the movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">he decides to leave the service and apply it to writing novels instead.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Did we mention his full name is Arthur Conan Doyle?</span>

From a glance at the teenage daughter's room, he figures out that she was chatting online to dubious guys and not doing her homework like she just told her mom.
</li><li> Spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurderByDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurderByDeath">Murder by Death</a></em>, where several of the world's greatest detectives are invited together. Two of them get into a Scanning contest, but one quickly loses and accidentally reveals in front of the man's wife that he's cheating on her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurderOnTheOrientExpress1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MurderOnTheOrientExpress1974">Murder on the Orient Express (1974)</a></em>, Poirot is somehow able to tell who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the cook</span> is because he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "has, perhaps, a nose for fine dining"</span>. Perhaps it should be counted simply as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> instead?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WithoutAClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WithoutAClue">Without a Clue</a></em>, Dr. Watson has this ability, because he's the real detective and "Holmes" is just an actor he hired to perpetuate the illusion that the detective he has been writing about in the third person is real. However, when Watson tries to give a scan of a prospective client to prove himself capable of tackling the case alone, he's met with the response that it's no time for games. When "Holmes" appears and is given the same details to reveal, or indeed when he even says something quite inane, he's hailed as a genius every time. He also tries to learn the method himself, but the best he can ever do is "deduce" that someone reads the <em>Times</em>. In the same scene, when "Holmes" claims to have deduced a bunch of other things about the person, all of which are wrong, you can see Watson looking puzzled and quickly scanning the target with his eyes.
</li><li> Hannibal Lecter's guesses about Clarice's background and personality the first time he meets her in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilenceOfTheLambs">Silence of the Lambs</a></em> fits this trope, though he is a psychiatrist rather than detective.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack">Men in Black</a></em>, when J and other potential MIBs are being tested, the other recruits unhesitatingly shoot the model aliens in the shooting gallery, whereas J plugs a harmless-looking little girl's model. Questioned, he explains the various subtle clues he'd noticed that the "monsters" were just innocent bystanders, despite their weird looks; the "little girl", on the other hand, is carrying an advanced physics text and is unfazed by the aliens surrounding her, suggesting <em>she's</em> yet another alien, concealing her nature for nefarious purposes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rounders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rounders">Rounders</a></em>, when Mike is reading the poker table at his law school professor's round, impressing everyone.
</li><li> The title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrKildare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrKildare">Young Dr. Kildare</a></em> by Max Brand does this. Though he usually sticks to medical diagnosis from observation, at one point Dr. Kildare is called upon to treat a suicide attempt survivor. He's able to deduce from his examination and a few words she mutters her age, social standing, wealth level, education, the fact that she's been in France recently and that she is not, in fact, insane (though actually proving that last one takes most of the rest of the book). After that, Dr. Gillespie points out what everyone else in the room noticed at first glance — the woman is physically attractive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrHolmes">Mr. Holmes</a></em>, the aged Sherlock Holmes is having serious memory troubles, but his continued ability to perform the Sherlock Scan is used (even in-universe) to show he's not become stupid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAssignment1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAssignment1997">The Assignment (1997)</a></em>: As part of his training in espionage, the protagonist has to enter a room and work out from what he sees if the woman who owns it is having an affair. This becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill">Chekhov's Skill</a> later in the movie, when he uses similar clues to establish that the woman he's meeting has slipped out to make contact with a hostile surveillance team.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Steve Rogers</a> pulls this off when he steps onto a SHIELD elevator in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em>. The elevator fills up but just with what look like regular SHIELD personnel on everyday business. However, Steve takes a quick glance around and notices things out of place, such as tensing hands and sweat, as if the people in the elevator with him are expecting a confrontation. When they get in, they make sure to move around so he's surrounded. Moments later all hell breaks loose as the entire elevator attempts to subdue him (which they soundly fail at). Steve even offers them a way out as a way of demonstrating that he caught on before they realized it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Steve:</strong> Before we get started... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner">does anyone want to get out</a>?

He's able to determine a lot about Frank Abagnale from their telephone calls. For instance, he realizes that Frank is from New York because he mentioned the Yankees and that he's a kid because he used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">"Barry Allen"</a> as an alias.
<ul><li> Frank himself is no slouch either. While waiting in the principal's office, he sees a student about to hand in a supposed note from her parents excusing her for the day. He points out to her that it's an obvious fake because there's no crease (from putting it in her pocket) on it.

After a good dinner, they retire for the night, and go to sleep. Some hours later, Holmes wakes up and nudges his faithful friend. "Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see." "I see millions and millions of stars, Holmes" replies Watson. "And what do you deduce from that?" Watson ponders for a minute. "Well, astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Theologically, I can see that God is all powerful, and that we are a small and insignificant part of the universe. What does it tell you, Holmes?" Holmes is silent for a moment. "Watson, you idiot!" he says. "Someone has stolen our bloody tent!"

This trope became the abused rattle to Doyle's sugar high kindergartner — but it's also been said to have been one of the reasons Doyle himself didn't like writing about Sherlock Holmes, since he thought it was a cheap gimmick. According to Holmes himself in <em>The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier</em>, it's his personal marketing schtick which is great for impressing potential clients as to his skills.

For example, where Sherlock says a man had a child based on the fact he has clearly just bought toys, Mycroft says <em>children</em>, as no child is of the correct age to be given both a rattle and a picture book. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ywrp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ywrp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ywrp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a>, of all things, when Jughead determines that a nearby man has two children — using the same rattle and picture book trick — and that the man is in the military, based on his polished shoes and haircut. Reggie points out that he could be buying the books for someone else's kids, or likes coloring himself. And he could just be a shoe-polish freak. Then the man meets a friend, and talks about his military service and two kids. Jughead pulls this several times throughout the segment. Then it's subverted at the end, after Reggie makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">the mistake</a> of betting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Juggie</a> lunch that he can't tell the professions of the next three people who enter. The three people are a clown, painter (with overalls and ladder), and a cop. </span>
</li><li> Watson himself eventually gets in on it, though he only does it mentally by checking off the clues that allowed Holmes to proclaim their visitor's job, marital status and Freemasonry. He even does a medical version once by identifying a spinal problem with a young boy.
</li><li> This trope was deconstructed (making it an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a>) in <em>The Sign of Four</em> when Sherlock deduces Watson's brother was a scoundrel only by studying his pocketwatch. This is Watson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> and accuses Holmes of knowing beforehand the sad story of his brother's destiny, and of using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">Phony Psychic</a> techniques to claim he deduced it from a simple watch. In a rare moment of humility, Holmes recognizes he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> and has hurt his friend's feelings doing the Sherlock Scan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a> without thinking about the consequences.
</li><li> Arthur Conan Doyle himself subverted this in a short story ("<a class="urllink" href="https://www.sherlockian.net/investigating/watson-trick/">How Watson Learned the Trick<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>") where Watson attempts one of these, and all the details he used had a completely different explanation. Doyle picks it apart a little in Holmes' own words as well. While his powers of observation and deduction seemed superhuman to onlookers — especially the ever-astonished Watson — he explains more than once that he can't deduce squat if there's no evidence, and that often there's a good deal of evidence that's simply too vague for him to deduce anything... not until he learns more, anyway. A glance at someone may glean three or four obscure facts, but he still remains ignorant of everything else without proper investigation, which is of course why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Mycroft</a> isn't a detective.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in a different Doyle story (<a class="urllink" href="http://fullreads.com/literature/a-false-start/">"A False Start"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), when a doctor attempts this kind of thing on a visitor... and not only is he off the mark on every one of his observations, the man wasn't even a patient, he was there from the gas company.
</li><li> Fittingly enough, in Mark Frost's <em>The List of 7</em>, a young Arthur Conan Doyle himself gets into a friendly scanning contest with Jack Sparks, an agent of the crown who rescues Doyle from a group of conspirators called The Dark Brotherhood and recruits him to help prevent a plot to assassinate Queen Victoria (and would later inspire Doyle to create Sherlock Holmes).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoNewAdventuresAllConsumingFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoNewAdventuresAllConsumingFire">All-Consuming Fire</a></em>, the Doctor and Holmes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover">team up</a> to defeat an alien invasion. At their first meeting, Holmes tries this on the Doctor. He finds he cannot make sense of the clues.
</li><li> In Laurie King's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaryRussell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaryRussell">The Beekeeper's Apprentice</a></em>, Holmes' female apprentice demonstrates her credibility to Inspector Lestrade by doing this to one of his officers. She and Holmes do it to each other when they first meet. She's at a disadvantage, though, because she's read all Dr. Watson's books — which leaves her with nothing to deduce.
</li><li> Holmes appears in a Jeffery Deaver short story in the collection <em>More Twisted</em>. He examines the clothing worn by a well-known mobster in a jeweler's office to which he had tracked the culprit of a burglary. His Sherlock Scan proves the mobster to have been the thief, and said mobster is arrested. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is actually a massive subversion, though, as the whole thing was set up by the jewellery shop's owner — actually a career cat burglar — to frame the mobster. He finishes the story incredibly smug because he got one over on the famous Mr Holmes.</span>
</li><li> Colin Dexter, the author of the acclaimed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InspectorMorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InspectorMorse">Inspector Morse</a></em> detective series, rewrote Conan Doyle's story <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Case_of_Identity">A Case of Identity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and gave it a different ending: all Holmes's deductions follow from the evidence, but Watson has some extra information and provides the real answer. One would suspect that Dexter thought the ending of the original story was a bit far-fetched.
</li><li> In <em>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</em> (and the nearly identical <em>Sherlock Holmes Returns</em>), the titular character, brought to the modern age via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">steampunk</a> cryogenics, routinely attempts to use this ability, but constantly arrives to the wrong conclusion due to lack of modern references.
<ul><li> Rendered as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatterSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatterSong">Patter Song</a>, "It's So Simple," in the musical <em>Baker Street</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> series, Vimes complains about those a lot, as seen here where he takes apart a very specific instance from the beginning of <em>The Red-Haired League</em>.
<div class="indent">[Vimes] distrusted the kind of person who'd take one look at another man and say in a lordly voice to his companion, "Ah, my dear sir, I can tell you nothing except that he is a left-handed stonemason who has spent some years in the merchant navy and has recently fell on hard times," and then unroll a lot of supercilious commentary about calluses and stance and the state of a man's boots, when <em>exactly the same comments</em> could apply to a man who was wearing his old clothes because he'd been doing a spot of home bricklaying for a new barbecue pit, and had been tattooed once when he was drunk and seventeen and in fact got seasick on a wet pavement. What arrogance! What an insult to the rich and chaotic variety of the human experience!
</div><ul><li> Nonetheless he occasionally does it himself, and he only notes that said evidence is out of place, withholding judgement until he knows more—for example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em> he finds a smear of white clay on the floor, which he notes is odd because Ankh-Morpork is on black loam.
</li><li> He does a subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em> when he takes a look at a <em>single clove</em> and gives an impossibly precise description of the man who last touched it. Of course, he knows who it is because there's only one man in Ankh-Morpork who chews on cloves.
<div class="indent"><strong>Vimes:</strong> Detectoring is like gambling: The secret is to know the winner in advance.
</div></li><li> Vimes also has a Holmes-esque knowledge of the streets of Ankh-Morpork (due to patrolling them for so long) and uses it to similar effect.
</li></ul></li><li> Very near the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> Artemis does one of these to their waiter—whom, he effortlessly deduces, is their informant.
</li><li> Parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a></em> novella <em>Flashman and the Tiger</em> where Flashman is observed disguised as a bum in an alley by a pair who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">obviously Holmes and Watson</a>. While Holmes makes fairly astute conclusions, they are completely wrong, demonstrating the limits of this technique.
</li><li> Voltaire's <em>Zadig</em> has the main character doing this. And also its subversion, since the sultan thinks Zadig is pulling his royal leg, that probably he robbed his horse and puts him in jail.
<ul><li> <em>Zadig</em> inspired Poe's Dupin, who inspired Holmes, inspiring all the subsequent detectives. So we have a genealogy tree.
<ul><li> The tree might even go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderthanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderthanPrint">Olderthan Print</a>, as the <em>Zadig</em> trick is inspired by an old persian tale (first written down in 1302): <em>The Three Princes of Serendip</em> (which gave us the term "serendipity").
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em>The Wisdom of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FatherBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FatherBrown">Father Brown</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G. K. Chesterton</a>. In <em>The Absence of Mr Glass</em>, some characters involve a brilliant criminologist in a domestic case, where he concludes with a sinister and dramatical interpretation of some facts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dramatic and totally false. The apparent killer is only a magician, so that the cards, the knives, the swords and the mysteriously large top hat have a very simple explanation</span>. At the end of the tale, everyone (also the criminologist) is laughing.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TommyAndTuppence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TommyAndTuppence">Tommy and Tuppence</a></em> short story collection <em>Partners In Crime</em>, which pastiches various detective stories and their tropes, Tommy Beresford makes a couple of attempts at this. In "The Affair of the Pink Pearl" he says to the client "You must find travelling by bus very tiring at this time of day", only to be told she came by taxi, and picked up a discarded bus ticket for a neighbour who collects them. In "The Case of the Missing Lady" he is able to "deduce" that the client has spent some time in the Arctic or Antarctic, by virtue of his distinctive tan. In fact, he was listening in when the man gave his name in the outer office, and recognised him as a famous polar explorer. (He also deduces that the man arrived in a taxi, adding to Tuppence afterwards "after all, it's the only reliable way of getting to this place.")
</li><li> Jim Qwilleran in Lillian Jackson Braun's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCatWho">The Cat Who</a>...</em> mysteries does this on occasion, most notably in <em>The Cat Who Moved a Mountain</em>; after hearing a single sentence from Dolly Lessmore on the telephone, he conceives a notion of her as "rather short and stocky, with a towering hair-do, a taste for bright colors, a three-pack-a-day habit, and a pocketful of breath mints." Upon seeing the sign in her office that reads "THANKS FOR NOT SMOKING" — the only deviation from this conception — he asks her when she stopped smoking and floors her.
</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStudyInEmerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AStudyInEmerald">A Study in Emerald</a>", in which the detective recognises that the murder victim is a member of the German royal family... by details such as the number of his limbs and the green shade of his blood. Played straight, however, in the rest of the story. This <em>is</em> a Holmes pastiche, after all. Most of them come from the detective, but it's also used by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sherlock Holmes himself — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise">a different character than the detective</a></span>.
</li><li> Horatio Lyle lists a string of observations which would lead to the conclusion that the man he's speaking to is Lord Lincoln. However, he comes up with these <em>after</em> concluding that the man is Lord Lincoln, to avoid the true-but-unimpressive explanation of "inspired guesswork."
</li><li> Subverted in <em>Dr. Hyde, Detective, and the White Pillars Murder</em>. A Sherlock pastiche performs the usual impossibly accurate predictions about the new client — and then refuses to explain how he arrived at them. The Watson pastiche later realizes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that the deductions really were impossible; the Sherlock had met the client before and was actually the killer in the murder he was charged with investigating.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmbertoEco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmbertoEco">Umberto Eco</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheRose">The Name of the Rose</a></em>, the protagonist William of Baskerville is able to guess the name of the horse the monks he meets are looking for. And its features. And the fact that they're looking for the horse in the first place, since they didn't tell him. And he's correct... well, sort of. He's right that they're looking for a horse, and he's right about the name, but:
<div class="indent"><strong>William:</strong> I am not sure [the horse] has those features, but no doubt the monks firmly believe that he does.
</div><ul><li> (They were simply the features the relevant authority said a handsome horse <em>should</em> have. The same applied to the horse's name.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a>:
<ul><li> Grand Admiral Thrawn, the titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a></em>, is able to look at a piece of artwork and gauge not only a lot about species' physical makeup (number of fingers, joints in the arm, etc.), but about their culture—and he can formulate strategies and tactics that take advantage of flaws in their psyches based on those. Very occasionally he drops hints about how he figured some of these things out. He can also make very good guesses about someone based on their tastes in art or how they regard it. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a>, Pelleaon, speculates that this may be done just to impress people, and he does his actual tactical analysis privately. Either way, it's still impressive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsKenobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsKenobi">Star Wars: Kenobi</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shopkeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shopkeeper">Shopkeeper</a> Annileen is skilled at evaluating a new customer by their purchases. Through what he buys, she can tell that Ben is a new arrival, didn't pack heavily on the way in, lives alone, and has a permanent dwelling and not a campsite, where he intends to stay long-term, and which needs to be heavily cleaned.
</li></ul></li><li> The Bene Gesserit of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dune">Dune</a></em> are capable of doing this due to their extensive training in minute observation (occasionally enhanced through psychoactive drugs) and, in the case of the higher ranking ones, assisted by access to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">ancestral memory</a> (which will often include other Bene Gesserit). They are also capable of variations, such as being able to observe architecture and determine the intentions behind its design. Those who are unfamiliar with the Bene Gesserit techniques often assume their abilities derive from magic or trickery (a notion the Bene Gesserit do little to assuage). Their observational techniques are also less effective when employed against another who has been trained in them and knows how to conceal or mislead the observed factors.
<ul><li> Also a staple of the Mentats in the series, both schools train extensively in observation, but the Mentats process data based more on statistics and probabilities. There are a few examples of individuals of both disciplines, such as Reverend Mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GodEmperorOfDune">Anteac</a> and Reverend Mother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChapterhouseDune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChapterhouseDune">Bellonda</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This ability is genetically engineered into the <em>envoys</em>, UN <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">super soldiers</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TakeshiKovacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TakeshiKovacs">Takeshi Kovacs</a></em> series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardKMorgan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardKMorgan">Richard K. Morgan</a>, who might find themselves downloaded into a war zone on a completely different planet whose culture, politics and rules of survival are unknown—thus the ability to note minor facts and quickly extrapolate from them is a basic necessity. Although a mercenary and criminal, it's no surprise that Takeshi Kovacs is often called upon to solve various mysteries because of these skills.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PaladinOfShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PaladinOfShadows">Unto the Breach</a></em>, Jay does this to Katya when he's first introduced to her. He doesn't, however, reveal how he deduced the assessment, which the reader only knows to be true from previous info given about her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe">Nero Wolfe</a> does this in his very first case, <em>Fer de Lance</em>, deducing things about a prospective (but still unseen) client just from the way his manservant answered the door.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>, wizard and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccultDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccultDetective">Occult Detective</a> Harry Dresden pulls these off, though they tend to be more subtle than most examples. For example, he's able to determine that a particular faerie queen was not responsible for a particular murder by simply analyzing her behavior and comparing it to details of the murder. At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TurnCoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TurnCoat">Turn Coat</a></em>, however, the scan is used to disturbing effect by Thomas, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">White Court vampire</a>, who has Harry do a few scans of some nearby human bystanders to see what he sees when he looks at them. Harry does so, providing detailed information on each group of people, at which point Thomas just points each group and says, "Food," one after the other, to demonstrate how different he is from Harry.
</li><li> Used briefly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a> novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDrawingOfTheThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDrawingOfTheThree">The Drawing of the Three</a></em>. Upon being released from Airport Security for suspected drug smuggling, Eddy Dean knows that they will have people observing him and manages to spot one. Roland, riding along in his mind, takes one "glance" and spots another five, despite the fact that Roland comes from a completely different world. Later, we learn that part of Roland's training was to pick up on tiny details as as quickly as possible, although he mainly uses it to kill people.
</li><li> Done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OscarWilde">Oscar Wilde</a> <strong>constantly</strong> in Gyles Brandreth's murder mystery series. It makes sense, though, since the point of the stories is that Oscar is a kind of real life Sherlock Holmes, which is why people go to him to solve mysteries. Bonus points for traveling with Arthur Conan Doyle during most of his investigations, and, while Conan Doyle does provide plenty of insight on the cases, he does not possess Sherlock Scan abilities himself.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s "Queen of Air And Darkness", the detective Eric Sherrinford opens his first meeting with his client with this, though drawing on the details of what she had told him when making the appointment. Later, he explains that he actively drew on the psychological archetype of a detective with such tricks. (Sherrinford is implied to be a descendant of Sherlock Holmes himself.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveHundredYearsAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveHundredYearsAfter">Five Hundred Years After</a></em>, Khaarven and Aerich take turns pointing out Sherlock Scan details of Chaler's corpse, to the bafflement of Tazendra (who's slower on the uptake).
</li><li> In one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> novellas, Geralt and the apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> do this to each other. Geralt deduces that the monster is in fact a curse victim, because his evil-detecting amulet didn't go "ping", and the monster can serve him food off a silver platter with no ill effects. The monster deduces that Geralt is far more than a simple traveller, because he carries two swords, when it's rare enough for someone to afford one, is much stronger than his build suggests, and managed to see the features of a portrait at the far end of a dimly lit corridor, meaning he has superhuman vision.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdgarAllanPoe">Poe's</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurdersInTheRueMorgue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMurdersInTheRueMorgue">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</a></em> (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">predates the Holmes stories</a>), we're first introduced to the detective skills of C. Auguste Dupin when he discerns exactly what the narrator had just been thinking about (the career of a particular actor) after walking down the street with him for a few minutes, breaking down the chain of events that subconciously lead him to that subject.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegCabot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegCabot">Meg Cabot</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QueenOfBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QueenOfBabble">Queen of Babble</a></em> has the fashion-loving protagonist do one of these to a man she's just met based entirely on the clothes he's wearing, down to his watch.
</li><li> Spoofed in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaskOfRa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaskOfRa">The Mask Of Ra</a></em> by Paul C. Doherty. Walking through the marketplace with an acquaintance, the detective points out a passer-by and lists off the man's occupation and family history. When the acquaintance expresses disbelief that he could have determined such details just by looking, the detective suggests he engage the passer-by in conversation and see if he's wrong. The acquaintance does, and learns that the detective's list was accurate in every detail — and also that the passer-by is not a random stranger, but an old friend of the detective's whose occupation and life history the detective already knew.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Babel17" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Babel17">Babel-17</a></em>, people often think Wong is telepathic from the way she answers unasked questions and seems to know exactly what they're thinking. She explains it as simply that her extraordinary gift for languages extends to body language, and at one point, gives a lengthy, detailed, and very Sherlockian explanation of the subtle clues that led her to anticipate what someone was about to say.

They soon explain that they and the rest of their comrades were dumped by the Spanish on an island to starve. (Although Bush is frequently noted to have little abstract imagination, though, he <em>is</em> very observant and perceptive about what's in front of him.)

In <em>Detente</em>, an op is almost aborted when they realise the mark they have very little intel on is staying in to watch his football team on the telly. Nadia and Sydney come up with an infiltration plan from a single glance at his hotel room through a surveillance camera, which gives them all the clues they need to immediately conclude the man has a long-term girlfriend who lives off his money, likes to party, is bored and angry with him, and is currently in the hotel bar looking for some fun at her boyfriend's expense.

<div class="indent"><em>[Leonard is on the phone with an unknown person]</em> <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> This should be fairly easy to deduce. He's holding the phone to his left ear—ears do not cross hemispheres, so he's using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> <em>[to phone]</em> No, I didn't realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there's no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.... <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> He's referring to an activity he has done before; it's unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test... like perhaps a colonoscopy. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> <em>[to phone]</em> Aren't there any other options? There's not a lot of room, it's gonna be uncomfortable. <br/><strong>Sheldon:</strong> Yes, yes. I'm definitely going with colonoscopy. <br/><strong>Leonard:</strong> <em>[to phone]</em> Okay, bye. <em>[to the others]</em> My mother's coming to visit. <br/><strong>Howard:</strong> <em>[to Sheldon]</em> How 'bout that, you were right.

His first piece of analysis is bang on: Leonard feels little emotional attachment to his iceberg of a mother. So is his second—Leonard does find her visits uncomfortable and unpleasant, which is why they are so infrequent. Sheldon only fails because he loves his own mother but hates invasive medical procedures. The final "not a lot of room" is just a confirmation bias. So he was reading the right signals, he just came to the wrong conclusion from it due to his own biases.

Hotch, using a combination of profiling and this technique, then goes on to reveal not only what colour his socks are (charcoal grey, incidentally), but completely deconstructs the attorney and reveals that he's a gambling addict who's in deep debt. However, this was completely irrelevant to the challenge that the profilers weren't as good as usually presented (which included several real-life failures of the technique) or the challenge that they were faking it using techniques a carnival psychic would (this is a common trick for phony psychics). It <em>does</em>, however, both completely undercut the lawyer's argument that Hotch couldn't accurately profile <em>him</em> <em>and</em> place him in the position of either dropping that line of questioning or being forced to publicly admit to everyone in the court that he <em>was</em> a gambling addict.
<ul><li> In another episode, Gideon tells a college student that the student's girlfriend (who isn't even present at the time) thinks he is about to break up with her, based on a necklace the guy is wearing. Later, it turns out that the girlfriend had very good reason to think so, as the student tells Gideon he has left her for another guy.
</li><li> In "Lo-Fi", Prentiss does a (we assume) very accurate analysis of a detective based on subtle clues, although she had been working with him for a little while before she came out with it. One item of note is his tendency to constantly hit on attractive women, except Prentiss figures out that he's actually a devoted husband, and the only reason he hits on women is because he knows they won't go for it. Had Prentiss taken him up on his offer, he would've immediately "run for the hills".
</li><li> In the finale of season 2 Hotcher tries this on Chief Strauss. It doesn't work because she's not questioning his skills as a profiler; she's questioning his skills as a leader.

<ul><li> Subverted in the first episode when Carl has a crisis of confidence after a case goes bad. Louis tries to pep him up by relating how Carl perfectly knew the history of a young woman he saw at the carnival. Scoffing, Carl relates he'd actually overheard the woman talking about her life in the dozen previous times she'd been at the carnival and he was just trying to impress Louis.

<ul><li> Notable is that Wells appears to figure out the secret identity of Cicada so the team arrest him. However, it turns out he's not Cicada and Sherloque was actually going off the fact that in 37 different Earths, Cicada was always the same guy.

Morgan's coworker notes to Jo (the detective) that Morgan can sometimes tell what happened to a body before even cutting it open. But, as Morgan notes in his voiceover, he's had plenty of time to practice.

</li><li> Tyrion Lannister:
<ul><li> In Season 2, he correctly figures out Lancel is sleeping with Cersei due to some choice phrasing Lancel uses and because he smells of lavender oil, Cersei's favourite scent.
</li><li> When talking with Cersei in Season 7, he's quickly able to deduce she's pregnant by the way she touches her belly and because when he pours some wine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyDrunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyDrunk">Cersei</a> doesn't reach for it.

<div class="indent"><strong>House</strong>: You think it's gonna come out on its own? Are we talking bigger than a breadbasket?

You're gonna rip something, which, speaking medically, is when the fun stops. <br/><strong>Jerry</strong>: How did you — <br/><strong>House</strong>: We've been here for half an hour. You haven't sat down; that tells me its location. You haven't told me what it is; that tells me it's humiliating.

</div><ul><li> Considering that the titular hero of this series frequently uses observation of minutia as a modus operandi, this only comes up infrequently with him.
</li><li> Parodied further in "The Letters of Septimus Noone", in which a college-age Jonathan fanboy does this a lot—complete with camera angles parodying <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em>—and is completely wrong about everything.

<ul><li> Bobby Goren is quite well-known for this, although this makes sense as he is based on Sherlock Holmes.

He asks Terry Randolph (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ViolaDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ViolaDavis">Viola Davis</a>) how she can afford an expensive private school for her two daughters; she responds that she's frugal. He says that <em>he's</em> frugal and still could not afford to send children to the school; she says that he wears pricey clothing (because nothing in his size is ever on sale), goes on a lot of dates (because he wears no wedding ring), and is intelligent (and therefore he has expensive hobbies). He looks impressed and congratulates her on her perceptiveness. Then he says that she never answered his question.

One time he's giving a presentation to a group of college kids. He tries to scan one and fails miserably. His conclusion? The guy's a psychopath. He turns out to be right.

Not only does he perfectly dodge traffic, he's able to quickly deduce which route gives him a better chance at getting away immediately after.
</li><li> The <em>modus operandi</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>'s Patrick Jane, which he used to use to pretend to be psychic.

An early example would be how she figured out that Wato Tachibana came from a medical mission from Syria by examining her luggage, and the surgeon's thread tied to the handle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> does this, but since he's incredibly socially inept, he doesn't always know which details not to bring up. Just a tip: If you know that a woman is lying about her age, don't call her out on it. Or if you know that the judge at the probate hearing is sleeping with his secretary. Or that a widow is having sex if her daughter is also standing there.)
<ul><li> The judge version hangs a lampshade, as the judge had been skeptical of Monk's ability to Sherlock Scan a person. The judge made the mistake of having Monk turn around and being asked to describe his shirt. Monk proceeded to ask which one; the one he was wearing, or the one his court reporter was wearing. He proceeded to talk about his Sherlock scan, including the blouse of the court reporter being in her bag with a button missing, the cushion on the couch the wrong way in, etc. Plus, the judge ruled in his favor, having been completely satisfied of Monk's ability.
</li><li> Parodied when a rival detective, played by Jason Alexander, is able to tell more details than Monk can as soon as he walks into a scene. Monk thinks the reasons he gives are ridiculous (and they do so sound to a viewer as well), but the other characters don't think so because they've seen Monk do equally incredible stuff. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> as this detective's mother overheard the criminals bragging about what they'd done while they were on hold (since she was a quality control operator) and told him what she'd heard.

When the constables bring along a man they found with a mask and a safe deposit box, the bearded man speaks up again, noting the red marks on the bridge of the man's nose and the fact that one hand is markedly cleaner than the other before stating he works a machinist. He goes on to state the nearby machine shop's shift change happened half an hour after the robbery, so he cannot possibly be involved in the crime. Murdoch demands to know how he knows all this, and the man peels off his false beard and introduces himself as Sherlock Holmes.

</li><li> <em>Over My Dead Body</em> was a Mystery show where this trope is deconstructed: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">Intrepid Reporter</a> is impressed by a Detective that manages to do a Sherlock Scan to a picture of a suspect.

</li><li> Shawn Spencer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> does this, but since he's feigning psychic powers he usually doesn't tell the subject how he knew. Though we do see what objects/spots he focuses on to make his deductions, we don't always get an explanation. Another fake psychic calls him out on the obvious glances at the clues. She's usually a little more subtle about it.

</li><li> Will Zimmerman of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> is able to do this continually. It's hinted that the ability is intensified by his training in psychology, but the show seems to go back and forth about if its base is an abnormal trait or not.
<ul><li> Watson (whom Sherlock Holmes was supposedly based on) hints that he also has this ability, and it was the abnormal awakening which allows it.
</li><li> It's initially implied that Will's ability is the main reason Magnus hired him. Except later we learn that Will's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandfather">Identical Grandfather</a>, an army captain, saved her life during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a> at the cost of his own, so it's possible her hiring him is way to pay Captain Zimmerman back for his sacrifice.

</li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> when JD deduces that Turk is naked over a watchie-talkie (a watch with a built in walkie-talkie) because his voice is always higher when he's naked. This immediately prompts Dr. Cox to remark on how disturbing it is that he knows that.
<ul><li> In one episode, JD considers himself stronger in diagnosing than Elliot and tries to coach her on how to put clues together in this manner by using a nearby example on display. The example being an odd, precise stack of sugar packets on the floor, which JD deduced was a ploy by The Todd to get a nurse in search for sugar for her coffee to bend down and reveal her thong.
</li><li> Played straight on yet another episode. Turk (a surgeon) and Dr. Molly Clock (a psychiatric doctor) challenge each other on instant diagnosis of a succession of people walking into the hospital. We never really know if either of them are right, but Dr. Clock's diagnosis of alcoholism for a man who walks in wearing a <em>beer hat</em> is probably on the money (and, to her credit, she concedes that that one was a gimme). Molly then turns this game around on Turk, who is ignoring the classic symptoms of diabetes that he himself is exhibiting.
<ul><li> And let's not forget that Clock became a psychiatrist because of her innate ability to immediately discern the one thing a person most hates about themselves.

Sherlock tells a college acquaintance familiar with his deductive scans that he's been around the world twice in the last month. When asked how he knew, Sherlock says the secretary mentioned it, which John knows to be untrue. Sherlock later explains to John that he deduced it from looking at the man's watch and seeing the date changes, but felt like messing with the guy's head.

To add to the humor, Sherlock immediately looks over at John and confirms he's not going insane by scanning him effortlessly (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithSubtitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithSubtitles">the subtitles point out "new toothbrush" and "going out on date tonight"</a>), then he glances right back at Irene's mischievous smile... and all he can get is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">"??????"</a>

<div class="indent"><strong>Holmes:</strong> I assure you, Sir, that outside of the fact that you are a Freemason, a solicitor, a bachelor and an asthmatic, I know absolutely nothing about you at all. <br/><em>[the visitor has a dumbfounded expression]</em> <br/><strong>Watson:</strong> Your watch chain, sheaf of legal papers, untidy dress and <em>[waggles hand]</em> slightly irregular breathing.

Watson is given the opportunity to perform a Sherlock Scan on Holmes himself, to explain Holmes's apparent bad mood and unexpected presence. Sherlock responds with a list of plausible alternate explanations for the clues that Watson picked up on, but finally he grudgingly admits that Watson was, in fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">right all along</a>.
</li><li> In the adaptation of "The Devil's Foot", Holmes plays with this schtick a bit. He meets a country pastor and does his usual observation and deduction of the man which is of course amazingly accurate, including the subject of his last sermon. When the impressed pastor asks how he could possibly have known, Holmes explains what he observed. As for the sermon, he playfully revealed that he had read a copy of the local church's last Sunday service program beforehand.

The single clue he has time to send his future self to avoid catastrophe is the number 3 implanted in his subconscious—which the future Data is able to surmise (correctly) means that they should listen to Riker because he has three rank pip/pins on his uniform. As Data does as well—and Data is the other one making suggestions—he's making a pretty big leap of deduction based on a single number, although Data does have the advantage that he would know "Yes, that's how I would think if I had to send a message back to the past from X future scenario." He's much more self-aware (in that sense) than any biological being. Given that he's an android, he has also probably run thousands if not millions of calculations and probabilities on what that 3 could have meant in the span of a few seconds.

Her quick work at crime scenes has her constantly putting forth theories that tend to be correct. She also manages to deduce <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Mastermind's psychology, motives, intentions, and several exploitable weak points</span> with no more information than the player is given. She goes on to casually work out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire purpose behind the Killing School Life</span> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">drops several heavy hints</a> about the game's major plot twists chapters before they are revealed.

Tell her her hard work, while not as lucrative as she might like now, will pay off and care for her family, and that she should worry less about money. For a dash of the supernatural, say the message comes from a kindly older man who looks like he awkwardly wants to embrace her. Do this honestly, claiming it's a trick, and people will be unnerved. Do it fraudulently, and you can bilk people. Do it without realizing it, and you may come to believe in you have psychic powers.
<ul><li> And of course, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; the existence of cold reading doesn't disprove psychic ability, but it does offer a powerful explanation for the apparent ability.
</li><li> It also helps that a skilled speaker can turn on a dime. "He looks so concerned about you," the psychic says, but the client looks dubious, "which is not at all like his usual attitude."
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> James Brussel, a psychologist called in to help in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Bomber">Mad Bomber<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of New York case in 1956 developed one of the first criminal profiles ever used to try and apprehend a suspect. In some ways, he was eerily correct. Based <em>solely on his handwriting</em>, he was able to correctly determine that the Mad Bomber was a Slavic man living on his own who would be wearing a buttoned double-breasted suit when caught. Displaying how it can also fail spectacularly, Brussel missed the fact that Metesky was unemployed, sent the NYPD on a wild goose chase through White Plains and claimed that Metesky was an expert in civil or military ordnance, the closest he came was a stint in a machine shop. He also got the age wrong, Metesky was over 50 when caught, Brussel predicted he'd be between 40 and 50 years of age.
</li><li> A sufficiently skilled mathematics or engineering professor can do this to a student's work, instantaneously determining where the student made errors in an engineering calculation.
</li><li> Some ADHD and ADD individuals subconsciously develop this way of thinking to compensate for their short attention span, and use it to figure out what they've missed after zoning out at school or work. It will then likely bleed into other aspects of their life, resulting in people who can figure out someone's dinner plans with a single look to their fridge and who answer questions before they are even asked thanks to the bits of dialogue they heard coming from the next room.
</li><li> Similar to the above, some individuals on the autism spectrum are particularly good at noticing patterns - they may see details in the environment that others miss, such as alphanumerical codes and background events. It's thought that the social deficit associated with autism spectrum conditions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">allows autistics to focus less on the people around them and more on the environment</a>. This, incidentally, also makes a lot of autistic people very good photographers: They are able to see photo opportunities where others might not.
