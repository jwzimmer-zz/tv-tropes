But what are writers to do when someone's attractiveness is a <em>plot point</em>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">Anime</a> artists have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishieSparkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishieSparkle">Bishie Sparkle</a>, Western animators have (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">used to have</a>) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleSmile">Twinkle Smile</a> — simple visual shorthands that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception">viewers intuitively understand</a>. But in live-action, often the only choice is to have the other characters <em>tell</em> us how attractive they are. Whether or not the viewer finds the character to be attractive, we must accept that within this fictional world, they are.
</p><p>This trope is about <em>characters pointing out</em> how exceptionally attractive they think a character is, not whether they're being drawn attractive, or whether the viewers think they're attractive. And having an unusually active sex life isn't a part of this trope either unless a character says outright that the <em>reason</em> that person is being pursued is that they're the best looking of the group.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Of course, this trope is difficult to avoid in literature and other storytelling styles without high-resolution graphics or visuals. Some works may describe a character's appearance in glowing terms and let readers realize for themselves that the character is quite attractive, while others are content to just tell us that they're beautiful and move on.
</p><p>This trope is related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo">The Glasses Gotta Go</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsAllGrownUp">She Is All Grown Up</a>, where we're informed that a particular character is more attractive than they <em>were</em>. It can be a consequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Generic Cuteness</a>, since there no way to tell which character is supposed to be prettier than the others. The inverse of Informed Attractiveness is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a>, where we're told that a character is unattractive no matter what the viewer might think about the issue and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity">Informed Deformity</a> where the viewer is told a character is ugly, but can't tell otherwise because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Generic Cuteness</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace">Inhumanly Beautiful Race</a> nearly always falls under this trope.

<ul><li> Kuroyukihime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em> is described as stunningly beautiful to females and males alike, in stark contrast to her boyfriend, who barely even gets a mention.
</li><li> Maria in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ADevilAndHerLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ADevilAndHerLoveSong">A Devil and Her Love Song</a></em> is appreciated as droppingly gorgeous; although the only things setting her design apart from other main female characters are her droopy eyes and her pouty mouth.
</li><li> Tokidoki Rikugou of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Amatsuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Amatsuki">Amatsuki</a></em> is always being told how cute and good-looking he is, and has people falling for him left and right. Kon never gets treated like that. The manga does briefly acknowledge Kon as handsome, but he's apparently "not much fun."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BGataHKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BGataHKei">B Gata H Kei</a></em>:
<ul><li> Main character Yamada is explicitly introduced as the hottest girl in school, and much of the plot and setting revolves around how attractive she is; but in neither the anime nor the manga does much in the art style distinguish her from a number of her classmates that don't receive comparable attention (she even has relatively small breasts, although she is self-conscious about this in-universe).
</li><li> Yamada's main rival for most beautiful girl in school, Kyouka Kanejou, is drawn with more extreme artistic emphasis on her supposed beauty, including an ever-present <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishieSparkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BishieSparkle">cloud of sparkles</a> around her head. Her brother, Keiichi, receives similar treatment on the male side of things. Still, their beauty receives establishment and support by frequent comments from other characters.
</li><li> Particularly informed attractiveness for Yamada's one-year-younger sister Chika, who, despite being practically flat-chested and looking more like a middle schooler than a high schooler, is even more popular with the boys than Yamada, and effortlessly goes through a constant stream of good-looking boyfriends who shower her with gifts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Orihime is the target of Kon and Keigo's worship, especially her cleavage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer">Even the Girls Want Her</a> as Chizuru is her very own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>. Yumichika, who classifies beauty by his own unrelenting standards, is reduced to a mumbling wreck when he first meets her. By the time she's in her final year of school, she's the subject of wide-spread school gossip about how she's so beautiful and sneaking photos of her face. At one point, Shishigawara is sent flying backwards by her appearance alone, leaving him dazed, shaken and wondering if she's inhuman because nobody human could be that beautiful.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>, Captain Unohana is worshipped as the most beautiful woman in Soul Society, Rangiku can get any man to do anything for her because she's the sexiest woman in Soul Society and Byakuya is considered the sexiest man in Soul Society.
</li></ul></li><li> Maika of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlendS">Blend-S</a></em> is constantly talked up as being the cutest thing on two legs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Dino</a> can't go two seconds without gushing over how attractive she is, and the other girls frequently praise her for it as well, even though due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">drawing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">conventions</a> <em>all</em> the characters are quite reasonably attractive as well—the only thing setting Maika apart is her small size and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HimeCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HimeCut">hairstyle</a>.
</li><li> Kouko Ibuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">CLANNAD</a></em>. Tomoya (in his guise as the show's narrator) tells us how beautiful she is. In <em>After Story</em>, Nagisa also at one point turns out to be quite the super-attractive guy magnet, which is even weirder since her looks didn't get much mention before.
</li><li> Ran Mouri from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> is supposed to be extremely attractive such that she's always the one who gets picked up. It gets extra noticeable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIVsDetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIVsDetectiveConan">Lupin III vs. Detective Conan</a></em>, which features characters from both franchises drawn in their respective art styles. <a class="urllink" href="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130724113601/detectivconan/images/5/56/Ran-mouri-ran-16133763-847-473.jpg">Ran<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> being equivalent in attractiveness to <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/60/Fujiko_Mine.jpg">Fujiko<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> strains the imagination somewhat.
</li><li> Harumi Sakamoto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FamilyComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FamilyComplex">Family Complex</a></em> has hordes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">male and female fans</a> due to his good looks, and everyone in his (all-boys) school can only talk about how beautiful/handsome he is when they lay eyes on him. This is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when he makes a brief appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessPrincess">Princess Princess</a></em>, where his smile could bring everyone to their knees. However, every main character introduced in both series are just as attractive, and while these people are regarded as good-looking in-universe, they don't receive as much god-like attention as Harumi does.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaiyoreNyarkoSan">Haiyore! Nyarko-san</a></em>: Mahiro Yasaka is a fairly ordinary-looking Japanese teenager, and yet the aliens of the galaxy seem to think he's sex on legs, with one attempting to auction him off as the star of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoysLove">Boys' Love</a> TV show and another writing an entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yaoi">Yaoi</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi">Doujinshi</a> about him — and this is even before you get to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>:
<ul><li> Haruhi Suzumiya is described as being stunningly beautiful in both the novels and the anime.
</li><li> Mikuru is constantly being called beautiful, gorgeous, and one of the cutest girls in school, to point where a picture of her in Haruhi's bunny-girl suit was selling like wildfire among the male students. Of note is the fact that the narrator Kyon adores Mikuru and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">his assessment is colored by that emotion</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Every volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HidamariSketch">Hidamari Sketch</a></em> lists "beautiful" among Sae's attributes. Viewer subjectivity aside, Hiro is the one who's actually gotten a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveLetter">Love Letter</a>, and Nazuna is demonstrably "pretty popular among the boys" such that "their" girls get jealous. Meanwhile, we haven't seen any interest of that type in Sae... from boys. (Girls... open for interpretation.)
</li><li> Mio Akiyama of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a> is repeatedly treated like she's the most beautiful of the girls and is frequently exploited for the sake of the band's publicity, to the point that she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceOfTheBand">The Face Of The Band</a>, even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">she doesn't look any different from her fellow band members.</a>

While she is cute due to the art style, in a series where the entire cast is just as attractive, it really doesnt mean much.
</li><li> Miyuki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles">The Kindaichi Case Files</a></em>. She is Kindaichi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, is the most desired girl in her high school, and in most cases, at least one guy is interested in her. She has exactly the same body type as other girls in the series and her face is very normal too.
</li><li> Naru Narusegawa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> is noted as being incredibly attractive by multiple characters, even with the very attractive Motoko and Kitsune as her fellow lodgers. Granted Keitaro is in love with her so he would idealise her, but whenever the group goes anywhere, Naru is invariably the one who attracts the most attention from men. Kitsune even lampshades it when telling Keitaro about their friendship:

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi">Nisekoi</a></em>: In story Chitoge is universally agreed to be by far the most beautiful girl in school and often referred to as "Raku's supermodel girlfriend". While she <em>is</em> very cute, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">art style</a> the main difference between her and other girls in the main cast comes down to their hairstyles. While there are other differences, none are so stark enough to illustrate the in-universe difference.
</li><li> Most of the supposedly inhumanly attractive characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Noblesse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Noblesse">Noblesse</a></em> aren't really drawn any differently from 'normal' characters, but people constantly stop and stare at them, clearly awestruck. Raizel is particularly prone to this, even though he really is almost identically drawn to Frankenstein.

However, because the artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">uses the same basic body type</a> for every female character who isn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a> or a child, she doesn't really look any better than any of the dozens of other attractive women in the cast.

Although, it's her ability to be "naturally cute" that's hinted to be the reason for her popularity.
</li><li> Sae Kashiwagi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PeachGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PeachGirl">Peach Girl</a></em> is always described as "really pretty" and "cute" by most of the guys in her school. None of the other girls tend to be described as attractive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>: Akane Tendo is the most sought-after girl at Furinkan Highschool, to the point where the male student body regularly accosts her each morning, for the right to go out with her. The thing is, she's no more attractive than the rest of the female cast. Some would even say she looks plain by comparison. Yet, if you let the guys tell it, she's the cutest girl at the school. For some fans, Akane isn't even the prettiest girl in her own <em>house</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Moka</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em> is described as very attractive a bit more often than necessary. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">By the main character who's madly in love with her</a>, sure, but every time she changes outfits, his response will be something along the lines of "You're so cute in your &lt;clothing type here&gt; clothing too, Moka-san!"

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, once in a while the supposed gracious beauty of the female characters will be addressed and it's treated as one of their most defining traits.
</li><li> In <em>Tomodachi no Hanashi</em>, Moe is apparently considered drop-dead gorgeous, which seems to be mainly because she's drawn with larger eyes than most of the other characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Toradora">Toradora!</a></em>: Ami Kawashima is presented as the most attractive female member of the cast, despite being drawn similarly to other characters. The only signs pointing to her beauty are the fact that she worked as a model and that most of the male class members are all over her once she joins class 2-C. In the Manga, one can notice that she has slightly longer legs than the other girls, but she's also the tallest of the lot, so it could easily be chalked up to that. We do have to keep in mind that boys stood in line to confess their love to the female lead, Taiga before she gained her nickname of Palmtop Tiger so Ami does have some stiff competition.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarAndIcePersonality">Chizuru Kawanami</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YumekuiMerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YumekuiMerry">Yumekui Merry</a></em>.

She's not very popular with the fanbase.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PrincessResurrection">Princess Resurrection</a></em>, one of Hiro's classmates gushes about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser">Riza's "firm muscles"</a>, even though she's drawn as rail-thin as every other character.

She reverts to her old appearance in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, probably because a large portion of the fans thought it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">cute</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheIrregularAtMagicHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheIrregularAtMagicHighSchool">The Irregular at Magic High School</a></em>: The surrounding characters praise Miyuki's perfect beauty even more than they praise her older brother's invincibility, to the point that her beauty staggers people who see her for the first time, and causes people not interested in relationships to fall in love with her. This has received dislike from some fans, as Miyuki isn't drawn particularly more cute or beautiful than any of the other girls.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HighSchoolGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HighSchoolGirls">High School Girls</a></em>, Yuna's younger sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Momoka</a> is constantly being praised as cute and beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">even though she looks pretty similar to everyone else.</a>
</li><li> Among the four school-aged characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyNextLifeAsAVillainessAllRoutesLeadToDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MyNextLifeAsAVillainessAllRoutesLeadToDoom">My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom!</a></em>, Katarina is considered the least attractive and Maria the most. Yet if you actually look at them it's hard to tell which one is supposed to be the prettiest or anything. Which may be the point since whenever Katarina hints at the issue people seem to be confused.
</li><li> Osaragi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> is apparently supposed to be one of the hottest girls in school (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsMostBeautifulWoman">and if the bonus page for chapter 158 is to believed, the hottest girl in the history of the magazine the manga is published in</a>).

Eve remarks that when she rebuilt herself some "improvements" were unconsciously made. That said, her bosom doesn't look any different than usual - Eve was always quite busty since day one, the way Mark immediately notes how bigger she is now doesn't match the unnoticeable "change" in her actual design.
</li><li> Veronica from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a></em> is usually treated in-story (more commonly early on) as more attractive than Betty, despite being famously the same face &amp; body with new hair. It's excusable when one considers that Ronnie dresses much better, often showing more skin, and Betty can compete on an even keel whenever she dresses in skimpy gowns/bikinis. One story even makes fun of this, when Archie thinks he's talking to Veronica, only to find out that it's Betty trying out a black wig.

Whether or not the princess's 1930s china-doll charms really do look like a kingdom's greatest beauty, or really are superior to the Queen's elegant, mature beauty, is naturally a matter of taste for the viewer.

Her design is taller and more slender, thus giving her a different kind of beauty than the other women. Also, she shines because of her "pure" natural beauty because she doesn't play it up (until she starts dressing elegant while in the castle), in contrast to all of the young women appearing in the movie. Even the only other innocent girl in the town - the one with almost no speaking lines, asked in the song "Belle" how is her family - is more fashionably dressed than our heroine, while the rest - the Bimbettes, Babette, the woman teasing the baker - use a heavy dose of sex-appeal.

On the one hand, she's depicted as a blue-ribbon knockout with a room full of tokens from admirers, and her musical number "Perfect Isn't Easy" shows her being fawned over by a pack of eager admirers. On the other hand, the film makes it clear that Georgette's opinion of herself is vastly overinflated, and of the main cast only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">Tito</a> expresses any attraction. Either way, her design is not that different from that of Rita, the other female canine of any significance in the film, save that Georgette is much more elaborately-groomed. It may be because Georgette is a poodle and Rita is a mutt.

They just return to professionalism once she announces the oath of celibacy. This is all in spite of the fact that she's completely bald, which one of the authors found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">quite sexy</a>.

Norton's character is so scared that he's too pretty for prison that he forces his friend to pummel his face into hamburger so he'll be uglier in the critical first few weeks of his sentence.
</li><li> In Nino's dream in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amelie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amelie">Amélie</a></em>, the headshots in one of his pictures come alive and argue over whether Amelie is all that attractive.

Suddenly, whereas no one gave her a second look before, every male within sight is fawning and gushing over her, even her 20-something years younger students, to the point where she needs to stop in the middle of a lecture to chastise them for ogling her. (Streisand also produced and directed the movie.)

Also, Amaro is described as "very young and handsome", with several women on the town sighting over him.
</li><li> Inverted in all adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JaneEyre">Jane Eyre</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>, Jane Bennet is the most beautiful of the Bennett girls who are all extremely pretty (except for Mary who is the plain one). Characters in the story agree with the assessment.
</li><li> Lanfear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> is described as the world's most beautiful woman.
</li><li> Esmeralda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHunchbackOfNotreDame">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a></em> is so beautiful that everyone who meets her falls in love with her, in some cases to the point of obsession. It certainly helps that she's also very kind and compassionate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em> has a male character described as handsome, to the point of being shown off to visiting royalty. He's found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamefulStrip">stripped and murdered</a> and the narration remarks that he was given no dignity in death and mentions a paunchy stomach and thin, hairy legs. Later in the book, a teacher whose family painted portraits tells Jerin that most women will see very few men without veils, so any of them with two eyes and all his teeth will be considered handsome; all the same, she'd seen many men and portraits of men, and Jerin is beautiful even with a standard of comparison. His attractiveness is remarked on throughout the book.
</li><li> The titular character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePictureOfDorianGray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePictureOfDorianGray">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a></em> is adored by everyone around him and described as enormously attractive, mostly by other men. The vanity that follows becomes the driving force of the plot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForsyteSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForsyteSaga">The Forsyte Saga</a></em>: Irene Forsyte is described as one of the most beautiful women of her generation. She's frequently compared to Venus and everybody is charmed by her. Actresses who portray her in adaptations have a hard time coming close to this level of beauty.
</li><li> Kvothe spends a chapter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind">The Name of the Wind</a></em> agonizing over how to describe Denna's beauty to the man transcribing his story. During this process, his companion Bast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">points out</a> that from a physical standpoint, she wasn't as awe-inspiring as Kvothe claims. Kvothe eventually recognizes that there simply aren't enough words for the singular love he has for her and decides that a simple physical description and the fact that she is beautiful <em>to him</em> will have to suffice.
</li><li> <em>The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</em> has Princess Kaguya, whose extraordinary beauty drives a significant part of the plot. Five princes and eventually the Emperor of Japan himself ask for her hand in marriage.
</li><li> Lara Raith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> is so stunning and alluring that Harry is incapable of describing her in anything but droolingly adoring terms. In the book where she's introduced, everyone in the room stops what they're doing to gawk when she enters. Harry has trouble keeping his wits together even knowing how dangerous it is to drop his guard around her. Of course, it helps that she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">White Court Vampire</a>, and thus quite literally exudes sexiness. Presumably, she isn't as attractive after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most of her skin has been burned off</span>.
</li><li> The D'Angelines of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KushielsLegacy">Kushiel's Legacy</a></em> series by Jacqueline Carey are described as having a slightly supernatural beauty to them, as they are descended from angels. This doesn't keep them from finding people of other cultures beautiful, as well.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a>, female Twi'Leks. Female Twi'Leks are seen as sexy and beautiful.
</li><li> A variation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilenceOfTheLambs">The Silence of the Lambs</a></em>; the narrator doesn't tell us Clarice Starling is beautiful, but comments from side characters do, and in a way that is nearly as blatant as if they came from the narrator. For example, when accompanying Crawford to a medical examination, two other cops watch her go in. One says that she doesn't look half as good as she thinks she does, the other replies that if she thinks she looks pretty damn good, he'd agree with her. These two people don't come up again, and literally their sole purpose in the text is to inform the reader that Starling is good-looking, a fact about her that serves no relevance whatsoever to the plot of the book or her job as a talented but inexperienced FBI trainee.
</li><li> It almost seems to be a rite of passage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> for characters meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady">Eloise Pritchart</a> for the first time to mentally comment on how extraordinarily beautiful she is. Initially, this is contrasted with her cold, calculating public persona as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalOfficer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalOfficer">Political Officer</a>. Later, it's usually remarked upon by characters noting that she's still impossibly gorgeous despite all the stress and strain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">her position as a head of state</a>. In no case does it seem to be an actual plot point — not that the fanbase cares, as she's an extremely popular character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several characters are described as attractive. Frostfur has a "beautiful white coat", Fireheart is a "handsome ginger tom", Brindleface is a "pretty tabby", etc.
</li><li> RiverClan is a clan full of gorgeous cats. They're so pretty that it's stated humans often "steal" them as their pets (though the only time this is actually depicted is with Graystripe, who was originally from ThunderClan).
</li></ul></li><li> Marguerite (wife of Sir Percy Blakeney) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletPimpernel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletPimpernel">The Scarlet Pimpernel</a></em> is immensely beautiful — she's the most beautiful woman in any room and she's basically the hottest redhead in France, England and in all probability in the whole world.
<div class="indent"><em>"There are many portraits and miniatures extant of Marguerite St. Just  Lady Blakeney as she was then  but it is doubtful if any of these really do her singular beauty justice. Tall, above the average, with magnificent presence and regal figure. (...) Marguerite Blakeney was then scarcely five-and-twenty, and her beauty was at its most dazzling stage. The large hat, with its undulating and waving plumes, threw a soft shadow across the classic brow with the aureole of auburn hair  free at the moment from any powder; the sweet, almost childlike mouth, the straight chiselled nose, round chin, and delicate throat, all seemed set off by the picturesque costume of the period."</em>
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> books, princess Ozma and Glinda are noted for being extremely beautiful.

She's tall and majestic; she has a fine chest, sloping shoulders, and a long, graceful neck; her olive complexion is dark and clear. Her face has noble features and her eyes are large and black and called as brilliant as her jewels. She has gorgeous raven-black hair, thick, long, and shiny and worn in beautifully arranged hairdo. She dresses well, too, and is very elegant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeverendingStory">The Neverending Story</a></em>: Gaya, the Dark Princess, is described by Gmork as "very beautiful... to me anyway". Given that her admirer is a ferocious werewolf who loves the sinister and fiendish, a human might find her to be either a malevolent yet alluring temptress or a stark reminder that other beings' preferences may be a tad different than our own.

This is continued in his spin-off series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> such as in the first episode where he is spotted by a talent agent and in "The Bachelor Party" where the fiance of Doyle's ex-wife Harriet meets Angel and thinks that he is Doyle, saying that Harriet didn't tell him what a handsome man he was. Then he's introduced to Doyle and is relieved ("Oh, that's better").
</li><li> Angela from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> is frequently described as extremely attractive, hot, etc. Much attention is paid to her extensive and varied romantic history.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> In season 7, Rachel chooses to hire a handsome male assistant instead of a more experienced woman, risking her job because he's <em>just so pretty!</em> Rachel, Phoebe, and even Chandler gush about how good-looking he is.
</li><li> Ross and Monica's cousin is so attractive that Ross forgets that <em>he's related to her</em>, and Phoebe temporarily turns gay.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradPitt">Brad Pitt</a> shows up in an episode that basically revolves around the main cast mentioning how attractive he is.
</li><li> Likewise, the first season episode with Victoria's Secret model Jill Goodacre. Chandler is nearly hypnotized by her hotness.
</li><li> Chloe, the girl Chandler and Joey constantly fawn over (before we're even introduced to her) and Ross eventually cheats on Rachel with. This one had the slight justification that, since she was referred to frequently as "the girl with the belly button ring," her attraction might have been less being astoundingly beautiful and more about her aforementioned navel ring and short, punk haircut might have made her seem "exotic" to the somewhat vanilla Friends.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:

</li><li> In the episode "Skin Deep" the team treats a 15-year-old model.

This is a major assumption in their diagnosis.

But on the show itself, her Vulcan character of T'Pol was presented as essentially shunned by the human crew early on.

Robin tells her that she's "beautiful", Archer isn't at all interested in joining the outlaws until Kate's life is endangered, and even Little John seems rather taken with her, referring to her as "a treasure". Prince John locks her up with the intention of raping her, Rufus the tax-collector kidnaps her and forces her to dance in front of him, and even a random tavern patron tries his luck.

The phenomenon usually expressed itself in the form of women hitting on them, giving them phone numbers, asking them to call, or generally indicating it with body language.
</li><li> In the episode "Navy Blues", the audience is reminded ad nauseam of the suspects' good looks during the detectives' investigation. They deduce that she's lying about her whereabouts the day of the murder when no one can remember seeing her at any of the places she claimed to be — "and this is a woman you'd remember" — and her alibi is further sunk when various men remember seeing her with the victim at places she denied being, all because she was apparently so gorgeous that within minutes of meeting her they were fantasizing about her.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em>, virtually every man who met or knew the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">Victim of the Week</a> (or one of them, being the female half of a married couple) was instantly awestruck by her beauty and even 16 years later in the present day couldn't stop commenting on it—even <em>Lily</em>, a woman, uses this to taunt one of the suspects, suggesting that he killed her because of his obsession with her (ironically, she's wrong about this guy, but this is precisely the reason that the real killer acted as he did).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em>, it's Ronnie, the much older partner, who is explicitly stated to be handsome.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>, it is made extremely clear that everyone in-universe finds Olivia Benson <em>extremely</em> attractive. Guest star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseMcGowan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoseMcGowan">Rose McGowan</a> also plays a swinger/con artist who is some type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet">Dude Magnet</a> who has almost every male in the episode falling at her feet.
</li><li> The character of Michelle Richardson in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em> is depicted as the best looking girl in school.
</li><li> In the BBC's adaptations of the Sally Lockhart stories by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipPullman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipPullman">Philip Pullman</a>, they cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BilliePiper">Billie Piper</a> as Sally. Now Pullman is a writer who does not go in for physical description on the whole and yet on the first page of <em>The Ruby In The Smoke</em>, he described her as 'uncommonly pretty'.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall">The Kids in the Hall</a></em> with a film showing us "The Most Handsome Man in the World!", who is barely real-life average, strutting down the street, acting up to his title.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em>:
<ul><li> In an early episode, Sue Ellen gushes over how handsome Cliff Barnes is.
</li><li> This also happens in later seasons when Cally (JR's second wife who is a twenty-something blonde hottie) is insecure about how desirable fifty-something Vanessa Beaumont is.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Poirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Poirot">Poirot</a></em> television series played this trope as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>, with Poirot's friend Hastings regularly gushing over any suspect who is an actress, model, aristocrat, or glamour-queen. Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMysteriousAffairAtStyles">The Mysterious Affair at Styles</a></em>, in which Poirot tactfully hints that his friend needs to shake his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty = Goodness</a>" assumptions.
</li><li> On one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>, Cliff is ashamed that the woman he's dating is ugly (you'd think that he'd be glad to have anyone at all; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">think again</a>). She ends up getting a makeover and having men drooling over her.
</li><li> Jane on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling">Coupling</a></em> is certainly flirty as well as reasonably pretty, but in several episodes, she's hyped up more than would seem believable. One particular episode has Susan being impressed by Jane's breasts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NipTuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NipTuck">Nip/Tuck</a></em> makes Julia McNamara's character the object of undying affection for both Sean and Christian. The guys (and later a girl) behave as though she is extremely beautiful. Christian gives her an eight out of ten.
</li><li> This trope was played with on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em> in which a pop starlet's husband is only sexually interested in her if she's wearing the tarty makeup and outfits that have made her career so successful.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GossipGirl">Gossip Girl</a></em>, Serena is treated as THE ultimate beauty of the circle by most of the characters, despite the cast being full of other very attractive actresses.
</li><li> The plethora of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">alien beauties</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>. All the main female characters (Aeryn, Zhaan, Jool, Sikuzo) are considered or have been described as "beautiful" or "attractive" within the show, but special attention is always given to Chiana, who gives off a sexual vibe that men respond to. Given the fact that these alien babes aren't human, we just have to take other characters' words for it. Though, notably, the only human we watch doesn't seem remotely attracted to Chiana and instead focuses on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaudiaBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaudiaBlack">Aeryn</a>.
</li><li> Necessary in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em> when the time comes to play out the myth of Cupid and Psyche. According to the legends, Psyche was the most beautiful woman in existence, so much so that Aphrodite herself was jealous of her beauty, though the episode makes it clear that the "real" story has nothing to do with their looks.
</li><li> Sally on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirdRockFromTheSun">3rd Rock from the Sun</a></em> gets plenty of attention for her looks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> Much dialogue, and indeed entire subplots, are devoted to Robin's beauty. Apparently, she is used to getting her morning coffee and bagels for free through her looks alone, and she doesnt even have to <em>pay rent</em>.
</li><li> In "Girls vs Suits", the cast makes a big deal about the hotness of a new female bartender, though it's ultimately decided that she's hot because she's a bartender, not because she's hot and a bartender.
</li><li> In "Twelve Horny Women", Marshall's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloAttorney">lawyer</a> friend Brad is so handsome that the entire jury and the male judge (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">who has a wife</a>) fall completely in love with him, giving him a huge advantage in the trial. This is especially jarring since Brad spent the entire previous episode disguised as a disgusting hobo.
</li></ul></li><li> Drake from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrakeAndJosh">Drake &amp; Josh</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kidanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kidanova">Kidanova</a> and his looks are hyped up a bit.
</li><li> The 2008 miniseries of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TessOfTheDUrbervilles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TessOfTheDUrbervilles">Tess of the d'Urbervilles</a></em> took this to great lengths with the character of Angel Clare. During the course of the series, he has four milkmaids (including the title character) who worship the ground on which he walks.
</li><li> Hyacinthe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KeepingUpAppearances">Keeping Up Appearances</a></em> has an unusual number of men over the course of the series get the palm sweats over her. It's usually the Major, whose advances Hyacinth tolerates to some extent because he's very-well-connected-socially. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, really, and usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>. Same goes for Onslow. His wife Daisy is unaccountably fascinated with his body. Even Onslow is at a loss to comprehend it.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfFrost">A Touch of Frost</a></em> entitled "Deep Waters" a girl is pushed down a flight of stairs by a stalker. Throughout the entire episode, she is repeatedly referred to as being <em>one of the most attractive women in Denton</em> by everyone including: Inspector Frost, her best mate, her boyfriend, her Dean, her stalker's best mates.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em>, we were constantly informed how beautiful and sexy Blanche Devereaux was. Most often by Blanche herself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>:
<ul><li> People on the show talked about Phoebe Halliwell as if she were the most gorgeous creature to ever walk the Earth. Despite the attractiveness of her sisters.
</li><li> Also neighbor Dan in season 2. His first introduction featured all three sisters' jaws dropping in unison.
</li><li> Leo is also introduced with Piper and Phoebe checking out his ass as he cleans their chimney. They spend the next couple of episodes fighting over him. Later in Season 8, a married woman called Eve flirts shamelessly with him.
</li></ul></li><li> Edie, Susan, and Gabrielle are praised for their appearances on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesperateHousewives">Desperate Housewives</a></em>.
</li><li> The Russian/Argentine telenovela titled ''Tango's Rhythm." One of the characters is repeatedly showered by compliments throughout the show regarding her intelligence, charisma, but most of all, her "great beauty," that supposedly made her a searing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a> and had all the men literally fighting for and throwing themselves on her.
</li><li> Special attention has been drawn to the attractiveness of Sarah on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em> in practically every episode.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>, Quinn is the prettiest girl in the school, and everyone thinks so. When Rachel is considering a nose job, she brings Quinn with her to show the type of nose she wants. This trope is later deconstructed though when Quinn reveals her fears that all she'll ever be is pretty.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium">Medium</a></em> the main character Alison Dubois spends half the episode talking about how attractive a woman she has dreamt about is.
</li><li> Played with in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CornerGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CornerGas">Corner Gas</a></em> where Lacey discovers that every girl in Dog River thinks <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrentButt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrentButt">Brent</a> is the most attractive male in town.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em>: Steve regards Laura Winslow as the most beautiful girl in the world (as do several of the other boys who show interest in her), remaining in love with her to the point of obsession throughout the show's duration.
</li><li> Brenda Chenowith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder">Six Feet Under</a></em> has no problem seducing and having casual sex with lots of very good-looking men who tell her she's gorgeous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlightOfTheConchords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlightOfTheConchords">Flight of the Conchords</a></em>: Bret sings about a girl he's obsessed with: "She's so hot she's making me sexist!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">The Brady Bunch</a></em>: This trope is the very reason why Jan Brady will spend most (if not all) of her adult life cursing the name of her sister Marcia (to a long line of therapists trying to reconstruct her self-esteem, most likely), having spent her entire childhood being told Marcia is prettier than she is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em>, several women mention how attractive they find Mitchell, usually while talking to George.

<ul><li> Played with in regards to Rory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> When Rory is first introduced, he's presented as much less attractive than another friend of Amy's. The Doctor expresses some shock that Amy, who is played by a former runway model, would go out with someone who looks like Rory. Making fun of his nose is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> for several episodes. The Dream Lord <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is actually the Doctor's split personality</span> refers to the Doctor as the "handsome hero" in comparison to Rory. Later, however, the TARDIS refers to Rory as "the pretty one," to the Doctor's shock. Amy also calls him "the most beautiful man in the world," though she seems to be talking about him as a person.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace">Inhumanly Beautiful Race</a> the Thals in "The Daleks", especially Alydon, a man considered to be unusually beautiful even amongst the Thals and is even described by Susan as "perfect." The actor playing Alydon is highly attractive but not so much more than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfBeauty">Common Beauties</a> Ian and Susan.

</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonOfTheBeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonOfTheBeach">Son of the Beach</a></em> where everyone (apart from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Woman</a> Kimberlee) seem to consider Notch Johnson as having the perfect male physique. In reality, he is ordinary-looking, skinny, pasty-white, middle-aged, and balding.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dean Winchester is often referred to as "the pretty one" or "Abercrombie".

His introduction is literally Sophie gushing about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForTeacher">how cute he is</a>. Fiz is immediately persuaded to leave her steady relationship with Kirk for him, Sally dolls herself up and gushes over him when he gives her English lessons, and Rosie transfers to Weatherfield High just so she can seduce him. His old colleague Charlotte is also desperate to get him to leave Fiz, and even a random woman he rents a B&amp;B room from seems to want to get him into the sack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>, most male characters who have met to Penny comment on how attractive she is. It's taken to even more insane levels later on with Amy constantly gushing about how "hot" Penny is while bluntly dismissing Bernadette as "passably cute".
</li><li> Doctor Drew Bair from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> - he's so hot, he managed to graduate from med school despite being an idiot simply because everyone was amazed at how handsome he was.

</li><li> Ryan has both Michael and Kelly fawning over him all the time.
</li></ul></li><li> In the series <em>Doc</em> starring Billy Ray Cyrus as Dr. Clint Cassidy, every episode went out of its way to tell the audience how good-looking Dr. Cassidy was: female patients would become giddy in his presence; female background characters, including extras with non-speaking roles, would frequently look at him with lust in their eyes; any female character he met for the first time would almost always make some flattering remark about his appearance; he even had a gay guy hitting on him in one episode.

However, Midori in particular is often described as especially good-looking, mostly by his fellow first years. (Maybe it's the height?)

Opinions on the appeal of the actual Ocelot in the game are, well, mixed.

And you can totally see why all the boys are chasing Julia, mreeow! This has resulted in fans widely assuming nearly every character is attractive unless specifically stated otherwise. Elan and Julio Scoundrel at the least are implied to have this associated with their maxed charisma. Elan is the most obvious example of this, as he's stupid and childish, and wouldn't be perceived as attractive without such cues ... and the fact that Haley loves him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, Ty Lee calls Azula "the most beautiful, smartest, perfect girl in the world", Azula treats this as an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a>". Explainable in that Ty Lee has a history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">Azula fangirling</a> (as well as living in perpetual fear of Azula's wrath), and Azula herself is just a tad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narcissist">egotistical</a>.
</li><li> Quinn Morgendorffer's attractiveness is mentioned frequently throughout the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em> series and even the other highly popular girls of the Fashion Club can be jealous of the attention she gets. Quinn's sister Daria is mostly ignored, though one episode showed that she can look rather like Quinn if she puts forth the effort.
</li><li> A flashback in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em> cartoon depicts the birth of Queen Slug-for-a-butt and her twin sister, Princess Whats-her-name. Even though the Princess is obviously the more beautiful of the two, the rest of the royals regard her appearance with horror and shock but praise the hideous Queen's stunning good looks. The narrator quickly explains that the beauty standards of slug creatures are quite different than our own.
</li><li> Nazz on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> is treated by all of the boys (except Jimmy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Rolf</a>) as to be the perfect thing of beauty. Could be partially explained that they aren't many females in the cast to be compared to (and Sarah is too young to be lusted after, and the Kanker sisters are all aggressive in pursuing the Ed boys.) Also, Nazz was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerlyFat">Formerly Fat</a> so the boys may be gushing over her not because she is beautiful, but because she looks MUCH better than she used to. It may also be because Nazz is possibly the only consistently nice girl in the cast and is friendly towards everyone, even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpopularPopularCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpopularPopularCharacter">Eds</a>, so her kindness may be a factor in how attractive she's perceived to be.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> with Blonda, Wanda's identical "yet somehow hotter" twin sister. The joke is, of course, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneLovesBlondes">Everyone Loves Blondes</a>.
</li><li> Lois Griffin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> is often described as very attractive and would normally be way out of Peter's league. Inverted by her daughter Meg, who is treated as though she were the single ugliest thing ever to exist in this or any other universe. What makes this really funny is, the only physical difference between them drawing-wise is that Lois is taller, slightly thinner, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedheads">red-headed</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played for laughs in <em>Bender's Game.</em> Hermes turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Hermaphrodite</a>, the most beautiful of centaurs. He merely looked like a centaur version of Hermes with a boob job and blonde hair.
</li><li> Zig-zagged with Leela. There are a lot of men who find her very attractive. Other men are too put off by her big cyclops eye.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Mr. Cat and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Pretty</a> would seem normal-looking compared to the rest of the cast if everybody else didn't act as if they were good-looking.
</li><li> Lu-Shi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KungFuPandaLegendsOfAwesomeness">Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness</a></em> is played as being Po's dreamgirl, and he is instantly smitten with her and calls her "cute" multiple times. She is just a typical looking goat with some makeup, however, none of the other characters find it odd that Po is attracted to her. What's more, Po doesn't really seem to notice more "conventionally attractive" female characters like Song, who couldn't seduce Po despite throwing herself at him.
</li><li> Rarity from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> is stated to be the most beautiful mare in Ponyville. Fluttershy is considered so attractive that she had a highly successful (but brief) career as a model. It's worth noting that 90% of the mares in the show, Rarity and Fluttershy included, have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">exact same body type</a> and differ only in coloration, cutie mark, eye shape, and hairstyle. Part of the motivation for writing Spike's crush on Rarity was to demonstrate Rarity's great beauty in her first appearance. It's worth noting that these two ponies commonly place high on real-world polls on which pony is the prettiest, so this is not coming totally out of nowhere even though they have the common body type.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Marge was not designed with the intention of being attractive, and is in fact described as plain or even homely looking multiple times early on. However, as the writers became more aware of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerverseSexualLust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerverseSexualLust">Perverse Sexual Lust</a> parts of their fan base had for her, they turned her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet">Dude Magnet</a> who is way out of Homer's league, despite not altering her design at all.
</li><li> Early episode "Principal Charming" has Selma claim that Patty is the better-looking of the two. The only difference between the two is hairstyle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> has a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attributes</a> in general due to its decidedly simple art style.
<ul><li> The fourth grade girls made a list ranking all of the boys in their class from cutest to ugliest. They must have been going by hair, since in all other respects the boys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySixFaces">all look exactly the same</a> except for Cartman (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">fatter</a>), Token (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">black</a>), Timmy and Jimmy (physically disabled).
</li><li> A few episodes indicate that Stan's mom, Sharon, is supposed to be rather busty, despite the fact that she's designed in a way that makes her look completely flat. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Except when she's shown in her bra or wearing a sports tank top</a>.
</li><li> Parodied in "Quintuplets 2000"
<div class="indent"><strong>Kyle:</strong> Those contorting Romanian chicks rule! <br/><strong>Cartman:</strong> Yeah, especially that second one from the left. She was fine! <br/><strong>Kyle:</strong> Cartman, what the hell are you talking about?! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysIdenticalTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysIdenticalTwins">They're identical!</a> <br/><strong>Cartman:</strong> Not that second one from the left; she had it goin' on!
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>, Mary Jane is presented as so stunning even the popular girls are instantly jealous of her, even though really she and geeky Gwen having basically the same design; Gwen just wears glasses and less fashionable clothes. Late in season 2 Gwen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo">stops doing that</a>, and everybody comments about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong">how stunning she is</a>. Though the fans see this as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryMakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryMakeover">Unnecessary Makeover</a> as it pretty much just makes her look like a blonde MJ.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekLowerDecks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarTrekLowerDecks">Star Trek: Lower Decks</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mariner thinks Barnes is crazy hot, and Rutherford later confirms that she's pretty.
</li><li> Tendi considers P'jok (who doesn't appear onscreen) to be a snack, and she imitates the clawing gesture of a feline to further accentuate how "tasty" he is: "Meow!"
</li></ul></li><li> Starfire from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> is constantly praised for how beautiful she is by the heroes, villains, and bystanders.
</li><li> Justin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a> Island</em> takes this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">ridiculous extremes</a>; nearly every female character (as well as a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGuysWantHim">male characters</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">most animals</a>) become dreamy idiots whenever he walks into the room (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene">rips off his shirt</a>, which he does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingShirtlessScene">ridiculously often</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatinLover">Alejandro</a> seems to be getting even <em>more</em> attention than Justin ever did, though they look nearly the same. To a lesser extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Heather</a> gets this too. Geoff called her "the hottest girl on the show" (after she had become bald) and Harold expressed his attraction to her early in <em>Total Drama Action</em> (again, when she was bald).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a> is described as being extremely, ruggedly handsome, with a 'natural charisma' and a cute little pink patch on his nose. He's so attractive that he's considered to look like a bankable leading man despite his has-been reputation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">the fact that he's been typecast as one particular character</a>; he's also irresistible to extremely hot, decades-younger women despite being aging, overweight, a sexual underperformer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">sometimes</a>) and having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">disastrous trashcan-fire of a personality</a>. None of this is available to the viewer on account of him being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">horse</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HiHiPuffyAmiYumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HiHiPuffyAmiYumi">Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi</a></em>. King Chad from the episode "In The Cards" is apparently the sexiest thing on two legs, to the point of making both Ami and Yumi fall in love with him the second they see him, with Ami calling him a "super hunk" and Yumi calling him a "bad boy". To the viewer, he appears to be a nerdy-looking teenager, with pale skin, a snub nose, freckles, buck teeth, a scratchy voice, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> personality, and a single-minded obsession with a children's card game. Naturally, the plot of the episode revolves around the two fighting over him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lila. Nearly all of the boys are attracted to her (especially Arnold) and even most of the girls (Helga in particular) seem to agree that she's the most beautiful girl in Arnold's class. Yet she doesn't really stand out from the other girls that much, aside from those with exaggerated features, such as Helga or Sheena.
</li><li> Olga is constantly being praised as being beautiful, intelligent, and just generally perfect in every way, though as Olga is a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodySue">Parody Sue</a>, this is probably intentional.
</li></ul></li><li> Linda Belcher and her sister Gayle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em> frequently have men hit on them or at least refer to them as attractive.
</li><li> Inversion: In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DastardlyAndMuttleyInTheirFlyingMachines">Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines</a></em> episode "Camouflage Hoparoo," the narrator describes Dick Dastardly as "deadly," "diabolical" and "despicable." Dastardly himself adds "dashing and debonair."
