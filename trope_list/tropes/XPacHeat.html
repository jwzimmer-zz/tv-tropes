</div></div><p>
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>, "heat" is used to describe any reaction to a wrestler and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick">gimmick</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">Face</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a> heat can make or break a wrestler; the former ought to be cheered, and the latter ought to be booed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightDeadlyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightDeadlyWords">Not getting any heat at all due to audience apathy</a> is the kiss of death in pro wrestling.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Then there's X-Pac Heat, otherwise known as "Go Away Heat". This is when the audience boos and insults a wrestler not because they hate the character, but because they hate the <em>performer</em>.
</p><p>X-Pac Heat can occur because the performer has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">pushed too hard</a>, they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector">political power behind the scenes</a>, or because they're terrible performers. For wrestlers, this often refers to those who have poor matches, or actively wreck the pushes of others, and become overexposed despite crowds not caring for them one way or the other, regardless if they're a face or a heel. This is not a villain whom fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">want to see punished</a>; a wrestler with X-Pac Heat is someone fans don't want to see <em>at all</em>. It's a very specific form of breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> by the fans and happens to be quite rare.
</p><p>"Not the right kind of heat" is an alternative meaning to "X-Pac Heat" that can (but does not always) intersect with it. It's more of a "we are sick of this person and don't want to see them anymore" reaction than a "we want this person to get their comeuppance" reaction, which is the impression you <em>want</em> the fans to have. This is more or less the equivalent of a villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy</a>, but fits this page more due to the pro wrestling/live reaction factor.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Normally, it is possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">correct an unfavorable response by altering a wrestler's gimmick or shifting their position in the company</a>. It is significantly harder, though not impossible, to overcome X-Pac Heat. Unlike the Scrappy, the audience is reacting not to an annoying <em>character</em>, but to a bad or overexposed <em>performer</em>.
</p><p>In short: if fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">Love to Hate</a> the character, or wish to see someone beat them, they're a heel. If fans just hate the character regardless of their alignment, they're the Scrappy. If fans hate seeing the performer <em>behind</em> the character, then it's X-Pac Heat.
</p><p><strong>Notes:</strong>
</p><ul><li> The live audience in professional wrestling is considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">in-universe</a> because it is such a major part of the show. When the reaction is obvious and on-camera, examples involving it can be considered objective, unlike those involving the viewers at home or other media. Therefore, it only counts as X-Pac Heat if the live audience is booing/insulting a wrestler in ways that they shouldn't.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartMark">smarks</a> and critics trash a wrestler, but that wrestler still receives the appropriate reaction onscreen, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">Critical Dissonance</a>.
</li><li> Be aware that wrestlers are usually only responsible for their performance in the ring, and, to an extent, the development of their character in the promotion that they work for. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector">Unless they have enough power to dictate the booking</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningTheAsylum">or even book the matches themselves</a>, overexposure is more the fault of the bookers than the wrestlers. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/BeABooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/BeABooker">"So you want to be a booker?"</a>.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SeanWaltman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SeanWaltman">Sean "X-Pac" Waltman</a>. He was part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">New World Order</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX">D-Generation X</a> stables in the late 1990s, and was actually a popular performer during this time. Several years and a heel turn later, DX was long since over and X-Pac hadn't evolved his persona in any significant way. Despite not getting pushed or doing much of anything, he was still booked on just about every show, winning a disproportionate amount of matches against opponents who were often more interesting than he was. Fans soon started regarding X-Pac matches as a safe time to take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">bathroom break</a>. <br/><br/>Both the X-Pac persona and Waltman himself, due to his membership in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheKliq" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheKliq">The Kliq</a>, soon became <em>really</em> grating, as he gyrated and gestured around and acted like a petulant little tool, making the crowds, who were <em>supposed</em> to find him rotten, hate him on a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">personal</a></em> level instead of a kayfabe one. The vicious combination of declining performance due to years of injuries, a stale personality (to put it mildly), and a reputation for attaching himself to a hot act, losing to them, but then squashing them cleanly during a rematch to ensure he captured more attention, caused wrestling fans to start chanting "X-Pac sucks". <br/><br/>One defining moment occurred on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">SmackDown!</a></em> during the Invasion angle in 2001 when, in a fight against a WCW invader, X-Pac mounted an offense and posed on the turnbuckle, drawing boos despite being the face. He looked visibly distraught at the lack of support from WWF fans. <br/><br/>Unfortunately for those who were sick of X-Pac, "[Wrestler's name] sucks" chants are frequently the result of regular heel heat (e.g. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock">Rocky Sucks</a>"), so X-Pac's push continued, to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">he received his own stable</a> (X-Factor) comprised of himself and the similarly-hated Justin Credible and Albert. The hatred for X-Pac eventually reached a point where fans would chant "X-Pac sucks" when there was nothing else to chant, even when Waltman wasn't booked on the show. In the end, Waltman ended his tenure with the company with an awful reputation amongst fans <em>and</em> his fellow wrestlers. His reputation continued to deteriorate due to an infamous video that he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a> appeared in, being accused of domestic violence during said relationship with Chyna, and a crystal meth addiction that got him fired from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a> after botching a match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>. While Waltman has gained back some respect for his work in the indies over the years, very few fans will claim he is their favorite wrestler, and to this day, the phrase "X-Pac Heat" is given to performers who "aren't getting the right kind of heat".

<ul><li> Most fans may remember The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HonkyTonkMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HonkyTonkMan">Honky Tonk Man</a> as one of the top midcard heels of his era, and the longest-reigning Intercontinental Champion in history. What they may not know, however, is that he actually got his start in the WWF as a babyface. Fans refused to buy into the idea of an Elvis impersonator as a good guy, however, and after a series of "Vote of Confidence" promos and an actual poll where the fans (as expected) weren't behind him, he was turned heel and the rest is history.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    WWF (1990s) </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The term "X-Pac Heat" was originally called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigBossman">Bossman Heat</a>". The term began to lose usage when X-Pac's level of "go away" heat eclipsed Bossman's, and it was pretty much completely retired with Ray Traylor's real life death in 2004, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">out of respect for the man</a>. To explain this a little more: first of all, Bossman was one of the bigger stars in the 80s, and for most of his career was acknowledged as being tremendously talented, especially considering his size. Furthermore, he was well known for being one of the most popular guys in any locker room, he donated massive amounts of money and personal time to charity, and his death was discovered by his wife in a particularly heartbreaking way.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0udrb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0udrb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0udrb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She saw him lying on a bed, asked him if he wanted a blanket, and when he didn't answer, went to kiss him goodnight and found him cold.</span> He suffered through a few bad gimmicks in WCW, then showed up in WWF, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam">SWAT Team</a> look, as hired muscle for heel stable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheCorporation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheCorporation">The Corporation</a>. By this point he was broken down by injuries, but he still played the part well. <br/>The bad heat started after The Corporation broke up, and the bookers decided to make Big Bossman the Worst Person Ever. He engaged in a feud with The Big Show where he tormented Show's mother and disrupted his father's funeral, he engaged in an angle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlSnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlSnow">Al Snow</a> in which he kidnapped and killed Snow's pet chihuahua and fed it to him. Due to his deteriorating physical condition, his matches consisted mostly of him punching kicking and stomping his opponents for the vast majority of the match. The thing that really turned fans against him was that he was a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a>. He almost always won by cheating, and whether win, lose, or draw, his matches always ended with him handcuffing his opponents to the ropes and beating them to a pulp with his nightstick. The worst thing that ever happened to him was occasionally he lost a match clean and didn't get his usual nightstick based revenge. Fans got tired of this very quickly. Bossman was put into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a> with a talented rookie named Bull Buchanan to help cover Bossman's declining ringwork, and after the team split he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>, then retired from the ring to become a trainer.
</li><li> While the original heel version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DoinkTheClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DoinkTheClown">Doink the Clown</a>, portrayed by Matt Borne, was over and is well remembered, when Borne left the company, Doink was turned face and portrayed by Steve Lombardi. Lombardi wasn't as good of a wrestler as Borne, and the fans didn't find Doink amusing. However, even though Doink wasn't pushed per se, he received a lot of focus and a number of awful angles  allegedly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> thought he was hilarious. By the end of Doink's run, fans were cheering the heels he faced and chanting "Kill the Clown!" Here's a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9MgPCV4UKY">Doink vs. Waylon Mercy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> match, with the "Kill the Clown" chants starting at 4:40.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">Dwayne Johnson</a> ran into this early in his career as "Rocky Maivia", when he was so pushed and overexposed as the next big thing that fans got sick of him almost from the moment he appeared. The fact that he was still very green in the ring and that his gimmick was that of a squeaky-clean third-generation superstar didn't help matters. After he received a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, which added some edge to his character and allowed him to cut loose with his formidable mic skills, "The Rock" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a> and exploded into a true star. <br/><br/>The heel turn is a rare example of the WWF actually playing to the X-Pac Heat. The week after The Rock's heel turn, he cut a promo addressing the chants, being the kayfabe reason he joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNationOfDomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNationOfDomination">The Nation of Domination</a>, naming the actual chants he was getting ("Die Rocky Die").

Prior to the heel turn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a> even addressed his concerns about them on air, saying that he wasn't able to understand the reasoning why the fans were giving him such heat. An article in <em>WWF Magazine</em> also addressed the chants as did an interview with him about them.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1v6h8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1v6h8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1v6h8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though it was sort of in kayfabe.</span>
</li><li> One of the strangest cases on record: Miguel Perez, a wrestler known less for his talent than his body hair, would inspire chants of "SHAVE YOUR BACK!" every time he stepped into the ring.
</li><li> Long after the fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a>, and former WWE and later TNA referee Earl Hebner received <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MontrealScrewjob">"YOU SCREWED BRET!"</a> chants whenever they appeared in Canada, and it's probably one reason why they don't appear in Montreal very much even when they do go to Canada. In all fairness, they did screw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a>. Whenever Michaels needed some heel heat, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xcflzf_who-s-your-daddy-montreal-raw-08-15_sport">Montreal was a perfect place to get it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> This heat has mostly died down, however, due to Hart making amends with both Michaels and Vince in 2010.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SgtSlaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SgtSlaughter">Sgt. Slaughter</a> was a very popular wrestler in his time and even became a character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeARealAmericanHero">G.I. Joe</a></em>. Then when the Gulf War built up, he defected to Saddam Hussein, teamed with old foe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheIronSheik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheIronSheik">The Iron Sheik</a> and was even given an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> manager that he initially thought was the real deal. This, along with vicious assaults on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAmericanFace">All-American Face</a> Hulk Hogan, caused fans to hate him to the point that he received death threats.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bdbl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2bdbl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bdbl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> wasn't completely dead yet, so wrestling was still treated as completely real.</span> As a result, Sgt. Slaughter feared for his life. In a sense, he was getting the right type of heat, but it got <em>far</em> too real. After losing to Hogan and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turning face again</a>, things settled down a lot.
</li><li> On rare occasions, a wrestler or stable can get good heat from some fans and X-Pac Heat from others at the same time. Right to Censor, a stable of moral guardians whose catchphrase was "You do NOT know what is good for you!" and who occasionally did things such as abort <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice</a> segments by covering the fanservice with sheets, are probably the best known example of mixed good heat and X-Pac Heat. About half the fans loved to hate the RTC, and the other half wanted them to just quit existing. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a>, who was then a heel sympathizer, talked worse about the RTC on commentary than he did about faces like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a> or The Rock is just more proof of how hated they were.
</li><li> This was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> debuted in the then-WWF. He was such a cheesy, over-the-top good guy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3jus4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3jus4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3jus4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">imagine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LeaveItToBeaver">Beaver Cleaver</a> in a singlet, and you'll get the idea of what his character was like at the time</span> that it was almost painful to watch. And then he started wrestling: not "pro" wrestling, but collegiate/Olympic style wrestling, with holds even more drawn out than usual, and downplaying what few showy and impressive bits there were. This went on for <em>weeks</em>, to the point that the fans didn't need any prompting to begin the "boring" chants, and many wondered why anyone thought bringing "the other kind" of wrestler in was a good idea. Then Angle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">snapped under the constant verbal abuse</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">yelled at the fans</a>, and switched to a brutal form of technical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatchAsCatchCan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatchAsCatchCan">catch as catch can</a> pro wrestling; the X-Pac Heat turned into the regular kind, and people were reminded that sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">everything goes exactly as Vince wants it to</a>.
</li><li> In a mix of this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a>, Terry Taylor would often get "ROOSTER" chants wherever he wrestled after his oft-maligned WWF run in the early 1990s as the Red Rooster.

<ul><li> The trope namer had a stablemate named Justin Credible who suffered the same fate. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a>, he was pushed as a solid ex-jobber who was "actually very skilled", though his workrate was artificially inflated by giving him good workers to wrestle with (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLynn">Jerry Lynn</a>). Eventually, as one of the last reasonably big names in the company, he got the ECW World Title, which resulted in <em>massive</em> overexposure. Even his former fans began seeing him as a mediocre worker with a terrible look and bad mic skills, and X-Pac Heat resulted.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4mbr2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4mbr2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4mbr2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He had a catchphrase and a fake "angry voice" that involved him hissing his words out in a loud whisper all the time.</span> ECW died shortly after his title win and he promptly got similar reactions during his second stint in the WWF/E. It got so bad that some fans even blamed him for the death of ECW. He retired from wrestling, and got a job as the overnight stock manager at a Target superstore in New Jersey. After working there for a while, he got back into wrestling and, though confined to the independents (and going from Target to baking breadsticks at Olive Garden), got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">respectable level of popularity</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattBloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattBloom">Matt Bloom</a>, better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">Albert, A-Train, Giant Bernard, Tensai and Jason Albert</a>, inspired the same "Shave your back!" chants as Miguel Perez above due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarpetOfVirility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarpetOfVirility">his Wookiee-like pelt</a>. He has since done as the fans asked, and gotten himself some badass chest tattoos to boot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">He even gained some serious popularity during his time wrestling in Japan</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">Shame WWE's booking screwed his chances of escaping his status in the West, however</a>.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a> cheated on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Matt Hardy</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Edge">Edge</a>, both Lita and Edge were showered with legitimate anger from the fans. This only intensified after Vince McMahon fired <em>Hardy</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">for complaining about the situation online</a>. Their respective storylines had to be scrapped, and Lita was forced to turn heel. Edge, a natural heel, was able to turn the X-Pac Heat into regular heel heat relatively quickly, and Hardy getting re-hired calmed things down a lot. Lita did not get the fans' approval back so easily; she was still showered with boos and vicious insults for the next year-plus later, and actually quit wrestling entirely partially because of it. However, she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/HeartwarmingMoments">well received when she made a one night return in 2007</a>, and <em>very</em> well received when she returned for the 1000th episode of <em>Raw</em> when she performed her infamous moonsault on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HeathSlater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HeathSlater">Heath Slater</a>. During the latter, she was referenced as a legendary Diva (WWE's former term for its female wrestlers), a far cry from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">another four-letter word she was once referred to as</a>. Fans were also genuinely happy when she made the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2014, not to mention her in-ring return in 2018 at both the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a></em> and the women-only PPV <em>Evolution</em>, so hindsight has erased a lot of the tarnish in her case.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VickieGuerrero">Vickie Guerrero</a>. The hate the crowd had for her during her run as GM of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWESmackDown">WWE SmackDown</a></em> was absolutely brutal. The lowlight of her X-Pac Heat was at a PPV, where she came out to restart a match. Through the booing, you can very clearly hear a fan yell "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">THE WRONG GUERRERO</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">DIED!</a>". She eventually got better when her screen time was reduced and her heel persona was toned down. Vickie is a fantastic example of the creative department taking the ball and running with it. Capitalizing on her annoying voice (which at first is why she got X-Pac Heat but became the signature of her on-screen personality, her shrill "EXCUSE ME!!!" becoming her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a>), her ability to generate heat in WWE was unmatched. Wrestlers working in the industry for <em>years</em> couldn't hope to get the level of fervor she got just by <em>showing her face</em>. True, she probably could never have gotten over as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> with her character's direction, but she'd unquestionably left her mark. When Vickie did retire on June 24, 2014, she got cheered big time as the fans showed they respected her work in the business, and it was a nice touch seeing her come out to the music of her late husband Eddie before she got well-justified revenge against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StephanieMcMahon">Stephanie McMahon</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VladimirKozlov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VladimirKozlov">Vladimir Kozlov</a>. Too easy. He began to be pushed to the moon within months of debuting and was even originally planned to be given the WWE Championship at one time. Any problems? Oh yeah, he couldn't wrestle. Yes, he was a heel all this time, so it could be translated to heel heat, but the smart fans hated him even more. To back this up, they turned him into an American loving goofy babyface, and the fans still hated him. It took a team up with the hilarious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SantinoMarella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SantinoMarella">Santino Marella</a> and a serious expansion of his moveset to become tolerable, though he was eventually fired. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> cut a promo where the audience cheered when this was brought up.
</li><li> During WWE's infamous "Rosie O'Donnell" vs. "Donald Trump" match, fans got so sick of what they were seeing, <em>they chanted for TNA instead</em>. WWE takes videos of the match down when it finds them, but for now, the full match can be viewed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5tcer_donald-trump-vs-rosie-o-donnell_sport">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "BORING" chants start at 6:30, "TNA" is at 7:20, and "WE WANT WRESTLING" is at 8:20.

Furthermore, they're so hated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>, whose own case of X-Pac Heat is documented in the Repeat Offenders folder, got cheers simply by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">beating the crap out of Hunter</a>, something that not even <em>ten months</em> of being booked as strong as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> could do. By WrestleMania 32, it had flipped  the crowd booed Reigns so hard that WWE muted the crowd mics, and they cheered for the Authority despite Stephanie pre-empting the match by literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheapHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheapHeat">personally insulting the audience</a>.
</li><li> Stephanie's case of X-Pac Heat is getting so bad it's starting to damage the company itself. A wrestling news site reported that in meetings with WWE stockholders, she has to open by informing them that she is only playing a character on TV and she won't act that way with them, and several outside media interviews as well as some of her own tweets show her doing exactly that in public view. Basically, she has to constantly take a dump on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> to keep from hurting WWE's PR and finances.

It got even worse after WrestleMania 28 when he became General Manager of <em>SmackDown</em> as well. Furthermore, he was booked in a main event feud on pay-per-view with John Cena, who himself is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">rather divisive</a>, and hardly showcased any of his former in-ring talent. The fact that this match took place after the very well-received championship match between CM Punk and Daniel Bryan took any remaining interest in Laurinaitis and dropped it entirely, and everyone was rejoicing when Vince McMahon uttered his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationCatchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationCatchphrase">hammiest two words</a> to him a month later.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> invoked this trope in his January 2012 return. Jerichos return promo consisted merely of him doing stereotypical babyface mannerisms and taunts for ten minutes straight, eventually getting the crowd sick and tired of his antics. By doing so, he established that he returned as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas">Bo Dallas</a> (Taylor Rotunda, real life son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MikeRotunda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MikeRotunda">Mike "Irwin R.

In January, he was entered into the Royal Rumble where he proceeded to eliminate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett">Wade Barrett</a> (the reigning Intercontinental Champion at the time), got into a feud with Barrett about this, and proceeded to go over him clean in a singles non-title match. While WWE tried to recreate Maven's infamous elimination of The Undertaker and push Dallas right out of the gate, most fans saw him as a generic, incredibly green babyface who made Barrett look bad. WWE did catch onto this after a while and took him back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWENXT">NXT</a>. But even there, he continued to be a powerful force, winning the NXT Championship by defeating legit fan favorite Big E. Langston. NXT capitalized on this by turning him into an disingenuous, egotistical heel that believed the fans love him even though they hated his guts. After returning to the main roster in 2014 (and shortly before moving to perennial lower-card status after his initial winning streak ended), Dallas was booked quite effectively as an annoying motivational speaker who told fans and other wrestlers to "BO-LIEVE!" while simultaneously being patronizing and condescending.
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarkHenry">Mark Henry</a> was walking to the ring for a match against CM Punk on the April 2, 2012 edition of <em>Raw</em>, a fan behind him held up <a class="urllink" href="https://i.imgur.com/4PiUf0Z.png">a sign<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> that said this:<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6dt22');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6dt22" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6dt22');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mind you, this was after <em>fifteen</em> years of receiving X-Pac Heat.</span>

</div></li><li> Mojo Rawley was the target of most NXT fans' hatred. He's seen as yet another generic babyface. Rawley was mostly disliked to due a combination of things:
<ul><li> His gimmick, which centered around being and staying "hyped", was mostly seen as obnoxious and grating.
</li><li> His moveset was <em>extremely</em> limited (i.e., he mostly did corner splashes and shoulder blocks).
</li><li> His finisher, the Hyper Drive, was horrendous; it's basically just him landing on his opponent with his ass.
</li><li> Surprisingly, it largely died down by the time he was drafted to SmackDown.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ryback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ryback">Ryback</a> usually got good, if not great, reactions as a babyface. However, he'd also gotten his share of "GOLDBERG!" chants, mostly from smart fans who saw him as a poor man's version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a>. This was especially true during his uninspiring runs as a midcard heel. It didn't help much that Ryback was accused a few times of being an unsafe worker. Most notably, Ryback was heavily criticized by CM Punk in his notorious shoot interview with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana">Colt Cabana</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay">The New Day</a> was launched in late 2014 as a babyface stable featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigELangston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BigELangston">Big E</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston">Kofi Kingston</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/XavierWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/XavierWoods">Xavier Woods</a>. Their gimmick is that of an overly optimistic stable that claps their hands and dances before, during, and after matches. The gimmick, however, went down very poorly with fans, who had, by early 2015, taken to booing them and shouting "SUCKS!" whenever one of the members would yell "NEW DAY!" The stable quickly turned heel, which turned their X-Pac Heat into regular, good heat. Ironically, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsHammy">creatively hammy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">and hilarious</a> heel personas were so popular that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire">they ultimately became faces again</a>. In addition, the fact that Woods hosts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/UpUpDownDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/UpUpDownDown">Up Up Down Down</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel where he plays video games with celebrities and other wrestlers, only adds to his individual popularity. The New Day's escape from X-Pac Heat also launched Kingston into main event status, culminating in his 2019 run with the WWE Championship.

As a result, even the babyface Team PCB, excluding Becky Lynch, received X-Pac Heat from fans. Banks was also popular despite her heel status. Eventually, Paige escaped her earlier X-Pac Heat by turning heel on Team PCB with an impressive worked shoot promo on the September 21, 2015 episode of <em>Raw</em>, only to rejoin them <em>one week later</em>, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">turning on them again after</a> Hell in a Cell.

Brie also had a bit of Daniel Bryan's heat rub off on her, although since her wrestling skill didn't improve much, she still got some bad heat.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EnzoAndCass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EnzoAndCass">Enzo Amore</a> may be the first example of the bookers deliberately getting X-Pac Heat on a wrestler. Enzo's a brilliant talker, but one of the worst workers in all of WWE. When the decision was made to split the Enzo &amp; Cass tag team, Enzo was moved over into the Cruiserweight division, which is the most workrate-centric division in WWE and the one most marketed to smarks. Numerous stories were also leaked about Enzo's obnoxious, egotistical behavior behind the scenes. He then became the Cruiserweight Champion in a match where he got next to no offense and won by cheating. It came across like, having noticed that smarks tend to cheer anyone they like regardless of face/heel, WWE built Enzo up to specifically antagonize fans into disliking him. <br/><br/>Unrelated to the booking in WWE, but not too long after they made him the centerpiece of <em>205 Live</em>, in January 2018, real allegations of Enzo raping a woman the previous October became public; he was immediately fired for failing to inform WWE of the subsequent police investigation. While no charges were filed due to a lack of evidence, with there being a possibility that the accusations were false, the damage was done. Enzo then went ahead and made the situation even worse by releasing <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVruAfu53z4">a hilariously awful rap song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about the experience, insulting his accuser and fans who, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/pV6eraIyMSw?t=266">as Jim Cornette pointed out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, were the only ones who actually cared about Enzo in the first place. While he was immensely popular among fans, especially during his NXT run, the circumstances of his departure and his subsequent attitude mean not only is Enzo's career dead and buried, even if he's completely innocent, few will admit to having <em>ever</em> liked him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JinderMahal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JinderMahal">Jinder Mahal</a> in mid-2017. Back when he was booked as a jobber on a regular basis, most notably when he was a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ThreeMB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ThreeMB">3MB</a> stable, fans didn't mind Mahal so much. Upon his return in 2016, his in-ring skills had moderately improved, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter">his character did not</a>. He resumed his status as a bonafide jobber before he eventually became a lackey and tag team partner for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RusevAndLana">Rusev</a> for a while. This all changed after WrestleMania 33, where Mahal was moved to <em>SmackDown</em> during the Superstar Shake-up between the brands, upon which he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">suddenly upset then-WWE Champion Randy Orton at Backlash in May to obtain the belt</a>, which he held onto for <em>nearly six months</em>. Mahal's mega push <em>could have worked</em> if it was given the proper amount of time and buildup. Additionally, Mahal shifted his character to a by-the-book <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel">foreign heel</a> that failed to captivate audiences while continuing to work mediocre matches, which further discredited his sudden elevation. This caused WWE's TV ratings and ticket sales to plummet even further than they already were. It didn't help that he regularly scored victories over beloved wrestlers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LukeHarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LukeHarper">Luke Harper</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn">Sami Zayn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a>, almost halting their pushes in the process. Perhaps worst of all though, nearly all of Mahals matches ended with a screwy finish (usually by his two henchmen distracting or impeding the opponent), ensuring Mahal never got over cleanly and proving that he was only winning because he was cheating. It's worth noting that Mahal didn't get much personal hate, as he was both humble and grateful for the opportunity, but as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/WrestleCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/WrestleCrap">WrestleCrap</a> pointed out, according to the numbers, he <em>didn't even draw in India</em>, which was one of the main reasons why he was given the belt in the first place.
</li><li> Vince's desire to push giants at the expense of better workers doesn't just apply to men, as the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NiaJax">Nia Jax</a> shows. Due to her size and bloodline, she was pushed heavily on <em>NXT</em> and fast-tracked to the main roster not even a year after her TV debut. Jax was still considered green at best and in the worst cases <em>downright dangerous</em> to work with. Even after being a focal part of the <em>Raw</em> women's division for months, she was still prone to botching and was pretty shaky on the mic. <br/><br/>Despite her reputation with the IWC finally coming around at the beginning of 2018, Jax has suffered numerous character derailments that she doesn't seem to be recovering from anytime soon. Between the months of March to June, she had been made out to go from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingMonster">Wrestling Monster</a> to a very unrealistic storyline where she was made out to be a bullying victim by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexaBliss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlexaBliss">Alexa Bliss</a>, who is <em>half her size</em>, back to a wrestling monster. The insane amount of sudden changes, not to mention the constant speeches about body acceptance after every match in the "bullying victim" phase, have utterly destroyed her character for the time being, so much so that crowds barely reacted to her appearing. It had gotten so bad that the title was abruptly won back by Bliss only two months into her reign via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> briefcase she won the <em>very same night</em> because fans were already so bored of Jax. <br/><br/>To some, it got worse as she ended up turning heel and aligning with Tamina Snuka, who a) was never really that over to begin with, b) is the daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmySnuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmySnuka">a man</a> that many consider even more checkered than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> even after his death, and c) despite not having competed in over a year, ended up on the women's Survivor Series team in favor of far better and more popular superstars like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EmberMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EmberMoon">Ember Moon</a>, Bayley and Sasha Banks. As if that wasn't enough, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">Becky Lynch</a> led an invasion of Raw and attacked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey">Ronda Rousey</a>, Jax was among those who defended Raw but ended up delivering a stiff punch (which some speculate as to being a legitimate shoot punch) to Lynch's face that left the latter bleeding. Initially seen as great for the run-off to Survivor Series, Lynch was legitimately too injured to compete, thus depriving fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolVersusAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolVersusAwesome">Rousey vs. Lynch, a match they were hotly anticipating</a>. Quickly inciting a <em>massive</em> fan backlash, many are calling for Jax to be sent back down to NXT or even fired due to her already spotty record of injuring other superstars. Not helped by how much like Roman Reigns, many see her push and staying on the roster as doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">a favor</a>, but unlike Reigns, who at least had some moments where fans got behind him, she can't seem to shake the X-Pac Heat off no matter what she does. <br/><br/>As of Survivor Series 2018, it seems much like the Enzo example above, WWE's writers are invoking this by having her gloat about breaking Lynch's face and revelling in the boos, which ended up reaching Ciampa or Reigns levels of heat that night, while also boasting her elimination of Asuka from the match just to spite them some more. The weeks following the event saw Jax become one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">disliked people</a> on the <em>Raw</em> brand. Many people turned on Jax, mainly due to the realization of her in-ring ability paling in comparison to the other women on the roster, as well as the <em>dreadful</em> mic work she had done prior to her second match with Ronda Rousey. No one batted an eye when it was revealed following WrestleMania 35 that due to an injury, Jax would most likely be gone for the rest of 2019.
</li><li> James Ellsworth first appeared as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">enhancement talent</a>, but his unique look and attitude led to him becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>, appearing on <em>SmackDown</em> again and even getting involved in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a> feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> over the WWE Championship. However, his beloved status among the fans started to evaporate when he repeatedly defeated Styles thanks to interference; some called it a burial and heaped hate on Ellsworth for it, but he was still popular enough to get signed to a permanent WWE contract and appear as <em>SmackDown</em>'s "mascot" for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries">Survivor Series</a> 2016. Immediately afterwards, it was abundantly clear WWE had run out of ideas for him; however, Ellsworth had just been signed and the company had to do <em>something</em> with him, so they paired him up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Carmella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Carmella">Carmella</a> as her lackey, and his goodwill with the crowd instantly evaporated. By this time, he was largely seen as a punchline that had ceased to be funny a long time ago, but WWE still seemed to think the fans loved him just as much as they had on his first appearance. The hatred came to a head at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> 2017 when he helped Carmella win the Money in the Bank ladder match by pulling down the briefcase for her; the fact that, technically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">a man won the first ever women's Money in the Bank ladder match</a>, caused so much hate toward both him and the company, with fans accusing WWE of blatant sexism, that Ellsworth had to be taken off TV for a while to calm the heat down. Ultimately, the company saw the writing on the wall and didn't renew his contract, and his last match <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy">saw his arm get</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy">snapped by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">Becky Lynch</a>. The general consensus among fans is that Ellsworth was a mildly funny in-joke that stopped being so as soon as the company got ahold of his popularity and immediately shoved him down their throats, and few were sad to see him go. He then made a shock return in 2018 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">by distracting</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai">Asuka</a> to help Carmella retain her championship, and the IWC's collective palms met their faces. He was gone <em>again</em> in about five weeks much to the delight of everyone, with his final appearance seeing <em>SmackDown</em> General Manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> fire him and literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatScrappy">kick him out of the building</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair">Charlotte Flair</a> started getting major doses of this in August 2018. She'd actually been on the verge of getting it off-and-on ever since her debut, but she generally kept ahead of it through solid in-ring performances. Some fans started to turn against Charlotte when she ended Asuka's massive winning streak but the criticism didn't become strongly present until she won the SmackDown Women's Championship at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SummerSlam">SummerSlam</a> 2018, becoming a seven-time champion in the process. Many fans were incredibly frustrated that she was once again in the title picture after so many reigns, along with the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">Becky Lynch</a> (a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> who had been expected to finally win back the championship after a near two-year long dry spell) was once again screwed out of a title reign. When Becky turned on Charlotte after the match, she was outright cheered, while Charlotte received enormous boos. In the ensuing feud, the more arrogantly heel-ish Becky was booked to act (such as demanding that Charlotte call her queen and put the title belt around her waist), <em>the more the crowd cheers</em>. It seems that Charlotte's X-Pac Heat and WWE's questionable booking had, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">completely by accident</a>, transformed Becky Lynch from a standard face into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> who could do and say almost anything and still get cheered for it, while Charlotte could act like the nicest, most proper face and get booed. It almost became worse after Becky Lynch's injury prevented her from facing Ronda Rousey at Survivor Series and Charlotte was chosen over Asuka to square off with the Raw Women's Champion, seemingly undoing their months-long blood feud. Come Survivor Series, she was briefly put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">back in the fans' good graces</a> with her not only putting up an <em>excellent</em> outing against Rousey, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">absolutely decimating Rousey in the post match</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire">with the fans actually being on her side despite all the boos they've been giving over the past few months</a>. This was short-lived, however, as the fans slowly returned to booing her in 2019, especially after Vince McMahon made her Becky Lynch's replacement for Ronda Rousey's opponent at WrestleMania. Fans were so outraged that Charlotte was once again handed another high profile match to the point the YouTube video of this segment on WWE's channel was regarded as the most hated WWE video of all time. Although Becky was eventually reinserted into the match (to no one's surprise), not even two weeks before the event Charlotte once again received nuclear heat, by winning back the SmackDown Women's Championship in a match that wasn't announced prior <em>to that episode</em>. The then-champion Asuka and every other women on the SmackDown roster was pushed aside, all in order for Charlotte to shine along side both Ronda and Becky (a decision that even many female members of the roster criticized publicly).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BaronCorbin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BaronCorbin">Baron Corbin</a> initially fell into this after being drafted to Monday Night RAW in 2018 as Stephanie McMahon's accountant, placed in a meaningless feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FergalDevitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FergalDevitt">Finn Balor</a> with repetitive matches and later usurping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> as the RAW General Manager for the rest of 2018; despite being designated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat">The Scapegoat</a> after being fired as GM, he still had screentime on the midcard , paired with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewMcIntyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrewMcIntyre">Drew McIntyre</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley">Bobby Lashley</a> with no explanation (with some feeling it derailed McIntyre's push as RAW's top heel in the process.) Though the reactions to all this were bad enough, the backlash after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> announced Corbin would be his opponent for his final retirement match at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 35</em> was what really turned the entire fanbase against him. Most people wanted either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> (who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">debuted in the WWE against Angle in 2002</a>) or at least for him to put over an up-and-comer who could benefit from retiring a legend, and as well as not being John Cena, pretty much <em>nobody</em> believes Corbin deserves to be put over by a name as big as Angle, not after his career has been mismanaged as badly as it has. Hell, when Corbin came out for a match later that episode, the crowd hijacked it by chanting <em>"You're not Cena!"</em> at him (this episode of RAW was taking place in <em>Chicago</em>). Unfortunately, despite expectations that WWE was planning some kind of swerve the match went ahead exactly as planned, much to the disappointment of <em>everyone,</em> with the universal consensus being that Kurt deserved better and that Corbin was an undeserving last opponent.
<ul><li> Corbin continues to get this reaction into 2020 as he's been continually pushed into main event feuds. This trope could honestly be renamed "Baron Corbin Heat" given that he elicits a far stronger hate from the audience than even the Trope Namer.
</li></ul></li><li> The second half of 2019 has seen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> become a major recipient of X-Pac Heat, and to a large extent it appears to be at least partly his own doing. The backlash toward Rollins started becoming evident in early October, in the aftermath of his Hell in a Cell match against "The Fiend" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt">Bray Wyatt</a>, a match that ended in a massively unpopular non-finish and gave off the (ultimately false) impression that WWE had no plans of having the revitalized Wyatt and his brilliant character win the Universal Championship. However, fans were already turning on Rollins due to his penchant for defending WWE to the death online and in interviews, going as far as to argue with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WillOspreay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WillOspreay">Will Ospreay</a> over their respective paychecks (among other topics). With Rollins still mouthing off on social media as the heat intensified — this included comments about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega">Kenny Omega</a> competing in the "minor leagues" — the boos kept ramping up, to the point that WWE had to edit them out of a pre-taped <em>Raw</em> from Manchester, England, in November. It hasn't helped his cause that he was also criticized by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a>, who said on his podcast that "maybe one day you'll be as over as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">your girlfriend</a>" while reacting to Rollins' comments on AEW and Omega. Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> took aim at Rollins on his <em>WWE Backstage</em> debut on Fox Sports 1, advising him to delete his Twitter because it isn't doing him any favors — this was in response to Rollins challenging Punk to a fight on repeated occasions ahead of the episode, and possibly to his past Twitter shenanigans as a die-hard WWE company man as well. For what it's worth, WWE seems to have leaned into the criticisms and had Seth pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> post-<em>Survivor Series</em>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair">Charlotte Flair</a> might be the first one to start the decade for this trope. Coming from a very divisive 2019 where the company had begun to lazily book her as a tweener, she finally managed to stop getting completely negative reactions by getting plenty of losses from the likes of Becky Lynch and Bayley (while still heavily protected). This, however, reverted completely back after the Royal Rumble where she managed to get the victory in the women's match over the favorite to win, NXT's Shayna Baszler. The crowd completely booed the outcome of the match, leaving Charlotte no choice but to definitively turn heel. The hatred only increased after she defeated Rhea Ripley and won the NXT Women's Championship at WrestleMania 36, with many once again seeing it as a useless win to add to her ridiculously long list of accomplishments and as derailing Ripley's momentum in the process.
</li><li> As of August 2020, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheVelveteenDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheVelveteenDream">The Velveteen Dream</a> has been getting his share of X-Pac Heat, largely due to WWE's decision to bring him back to television despite numerous accusations of sexual misconduct and grooming toward minors, and soon after, Triple H's claim that the company found nothing incriminating against him, and that Dream's hiatus was a result of a car crash he was involved in (Not helping that one of his accusers stated that he was never contacted for the investigation). While the coronavirus pandemic has indefinitely prevented WWE from holding shows with live audiences, many fans took to Twitter to call the company out for allowing Dream to return to action on <em>NXT</em>. And when WWE launched its virtual fan experience, the ThunderDome, just ahead of <em>SummerSlam</em> 2020, one fan found himself <a class="urllink" href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2020/08/23/fan-uses-wwe-summerslam-thunderdome-seat-to-say-fire-velveteen-dream/">banned from the service<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for showing a "Fire Velveteen Dream" sign on his live feed during the event. If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FinnBalor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FinnBalor">Finn Bálor</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/FinnBalor/status/1296191535319523331?s=20">tweet<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in regards to his match against Dream is anything to go by, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">not even a good portion of the roster is happy to have him back.</a> Furthermore, not helping matters is the fact that due to said scandal, WWE hasn't been shy to fire and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">Un-person</a> other three superstars for <em>the same reason</em> (<em>NXT UK</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TravisBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TravisBanks">Travis Banks</a> and El Ligero, and <em>205 Live</em>'s "Gentleman" Jack Gallagher), so why Velveteen is still on the company is anyone's guess.

<ul><li> A classic case of this: the Dynamic Dudes, who were skateboarding wrestlers. When they received a face push by having manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> betray them for an opposing heel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">tag team</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMidnightExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMidnightExpress">The Midnight Express</a>), the audience cheered Cornette. Amusingly, the Dynamic Dudes included later X-Pac Heat recipient John Laurinaitis.
</li><li> Erik Watts from the early days of WCW. He was pushed because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">he was the son of Cowboy Bill Watts</a>, who was in charge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> at the time. He was a crappy wrestler, didn't have a great physique, and was nearly booed out of the building whenever he appeared. The sad part is that he did eventually develop some talent in the ring and a decent look, but was so notorious for his nepotistic push that he still couldn't get over and promoters were afraid to push him very hard.
</li><li> Hulk Hogan was one of if not the biggest WWF stars of all time. However, when he brought the flexing, no-selling, All-American gimmick to WCW, fans were lukewarm at best at first, and progressed to booing him and throwing his merchandise back into the ring. The negative fan reaction inspired Hogan to agree to turn heel, becoming the villainous Hollywood Hogan and forming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">New World Order</a>. It worked impressively. However, once the nWo ran its course and he turned back into Hulk Hogan, the negative reactions came back. Hardcore fans knew of Hogan's backstage politicing and resented him for it, and both hardcore and casual fans, many of whom had been fans of the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a>, hated the WWF's campy, story-driven style that Hogan brought with him compared to the NWA's hard action and grittier aesthetic. It also didn't help that his turn back to Hulk Hogan was matched up with an attempted heel turn by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a>, who the fans adamantly refused to boo no matter what he did.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/UltimateWarrior">Ultimate Warrior</a> had a disastrous run in WCW. He was initially well-received by fans during his debut on <em>Nitro</em> when he interrupted a Hollywood Hogan promo. His pop soon diminished, however, as fans grew to dislike him. It wasn't long before Warrior was receiving heavy boos, despite playing a face to Hogan's heel. His terrible promo and wrestling abilities, as well as a bad angle by this point, grated on fans. He also had considerable creative control over his character in WCW, and entered himself and Hogan into an angle that was very much hated by fans. The penultimate moment being when he was haunting Hogan through a locker room mirror, but the angle called for Hogan being the only person who could see him, even though everyone watching could see him as well.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8hp2k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8hp2k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8hp2k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This was made even worse when Eric Bischoff kept pretending that he couldn't see Warrior.</span> Warrior only wrestled in two matches during his brief tenure,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9lig9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9lig9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9lig9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Technically, he appeared in three matches.

He was gone shortly afterward.
</li><li> The No Limit Soldiers, a stable of rappers led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MasterP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MasterP">Master P</a>, were conceived of when WCW decided to try and target the urban/hip hop market. WCW intended to bring hip hop fans into the wrestling fandom, and Master P wanted to give his cousin Swoll a break in the wrestling business. WCW put veterans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Konnan">Konnan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio Jr.</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman">Billy Kidman</a> in the stable along with Swoll, a pair of muscular rookies named Chase and 4x4, and former jobber "BA" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BradArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BradArmstrong">Brad Armstrong</a> to take bumps and cover for the rookies. WCW then made a country music stable to feud with them, the West Texas Rednecks,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note102rg7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note102rg7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note102rg7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Actually the West Texas Outlaws; West Texas Rednecks was supposed to be an insult, but between the commentators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">almost never calling them the Outlaws</a> and the southern fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">not taking "rednecks" as an insult</a>, Rednecks became the official name.</span> consisting of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CurtHennig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CurtHennig">Curt Hennig</a>, Bobby Duncum Jr., and Kendall and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BarryWindham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BarryWindham">Barry Windham</a>. <br/><br/>The angle was a clusterfuck from the beginning. Master P wasn't seen by the hip hop fandom as particularly cool or a particularly good rapper at the time.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11qes6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11qes6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11qes6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And his raps for WCW certainly didn't impress anyone.</span> He failed to draw in any new fans, and then after he was booed on his first appearance, he refused to return and support the angle. Although the Soldiers were supposed to be street-wise antiheroes, they simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">came across as heels</a> (particularly in that <em>they</em> started the feud with the Rednecks, destroying a gift Hennig intended for Master P's brother and then attacking him for no particular reason), and the bloated roster of re-gimmicked veterans and rookies no one had ever heard of before failed to connect with the fans. Meanwhile, the Rednecks recorded a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">downright hilarious</a> song titled "Rap is Crap", held their own against the No Limit Soldiers despite being outnumbered almost two-to-one, and had Hennig, widely considered one of the best ever in the business and a really nice guy to boot, as their leader. Also, the WCW fanbase, which was largely white southern males, was pre-conditioned to prefer the country music-loving rednecks anyway. It's no surprise the latter stable became a collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>. So with the fans cheering the Rednecks and booing every time the Soldiers chanted "hootie-hoo," the angle ended barely a month in. Konnan, Mysterio, and Kidman split from the group to form The Filthy Animals, BA reunited with his brother Scott Armstrong, and Swoll and 4x4 disappeared uneventfully, with Chase having already vanished without explanation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DiamondDallasPage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DiamondDallasPage">Diamond Dallas Page</a> received this reaction in 1999, as fans grew tired of his good guy shtick.

When attacking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a> to solidify his turn, he started shouting "Boo me now, bitch!" at the fans.
</li><li> The Harris Twins in general, but especially in WCW in 1999 and 2000. They were pushed as monsters and rarely lost, but they were pretty much lacking charisma entirely and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> finisher, the A-Bomb, didn't look particularly devastating.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12d4sy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12d4sy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12d4sy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was more or less a two man flapjack press.</span> When they performed a run-in at a pay-per-view after it had been announced that they'd been released a few days earlier, the fans <em>groaned</em>.

Drop the title!" There were even chants of "Fuck you, Jarrett! Fuck you, Jarrett!" Jarrett was truly hated by TNA fans for good reasons—during the first four years, he held the NWA Championship for the better part of <em>three</em> of them. Occasionally, he would lose at a pay-per-view, only to win the title back at the very next show, leading fans to see the title as meaningless, since it had just become a prop for Jarrett. In <em>every</em> match he had at the time, he resorted to running into the crowd. To make matters worse, Jarrett was more than just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a>—as one of the founders of TNA, <em>he was the creator</em>.

Russo's not the only one behind the shows, of course, but his track record with WWE and WCW made him a convenient lightning rod for fans' wrath. He <em>was</em> fired in February 2012, so it's left to the fans to come up with new chants.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1384vw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1384vw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1384vw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He secretly returned to TNA as a consultant from 2013-2014 since neither the fans nor Spike TV wanted him anywhere near the product.</span>

Then WWE had the gall to bring the actual stars of <em>Jackass</em> onto <em>Monday Night Raw</em>, where people started cheering when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga">Umaga</a> started legitimately beating on Steve-O.

Bubba later ambushed Kong during her appearance on <em>The Cowhead Show</em> which turned out to be an elaborate setup by Bubba and show host Mike Calta to lure Kong on the show in the first place. This eventually led to his firing from TNA, capped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mick Foley</a> giving Bubba a legitimate punch to the face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">Guess how the fandom responded?</a>

He had already antagonized the fans by making comments about having no passion for wrestling in an interview, and the fans were further antagonized by the presence of a couple hundred teenage girls in the audience who'd showed up <em>just</em> for Jeff Hardy. Things got worse when Hardy came out in his Will-o-the-Wisp attire, and received chants of "We want Matt!". Then the match started, and it was awful, with Hardy botching nearly everything he attempted to do, and Krazy K (a trainee of Hardy's who had no other reason to even be in the match) being worse than Hardy. The fans cheered for everything Joey Matthews (who was supposed to be the heel) did and booed everything Hardy or Krazy K did. When the match ended, with Jeff winning, the fans chanted "Don't come back!"

He fell right back into this type of heat in his second run in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">fat shaming</a> but by the end of his run was again managing to get good heat, doing much to help Mike Bennett's own case of this (see below). By the time of Matt's third run he was so welcomed there weren't even any complaints when he vowed to bring back Jeff Hardy...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ahem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ahem">ahem</a>, Brother Nero.
</li><li> In Summer 2007, "Emo Kid" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs">Jimmy Jacobs</a> was transitioning into a new, much eviler role as the leader of a stable called The Age of the Fall. This, in and of itself, wasn't all that awful an angle. However, at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a> <em>Man Up</em> PPV in September, Jimmy came out to speak to the crowd. For over 10 straight minutes. Much of this wasn't speaking, but standing around with his arms raised, saying nothing, while wearing a nice white jacket and being bled on by Jay Briscoe of The Briscoes suspended from the ceiling, head down, bleeding <em>copiously</em>. The crowd was <em>furious</em>, screaming to move <em>on</em> already. It totally burned all the house energy, which was at insane levels after the previous match  a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a> match featuring The Briscoes facing off against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamiZayn">El Generico</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen">Kevin Steen</a> (aka "Steenerico") in a Ladder Match referred to as "Ladder War". It also bears mentioning that, initially at least, Jimmy Jacobs (and at that, all members of Age of the Fall) used a track of high-pitched female screaming for their entry music that lasted for several minutes. It was utterly intolerable, and changed quickly. Laurie Strode's screaming from the <em>Halloween</em> remake was eventually used as the intro for The Age of the Fall's actual entrance theme.
</li><li> The Kingdom, mainly due to two members, 2011 Top Prospect Tournament winner Mike Bennett and 2013 Top Prospect Tournament winner Matt Taven. The RoHbots didn't agree with either decision then and by 2015 still hadn't warmed up to either man after years of pushes, especially not with tag team title runs that saw them emulate the Hardy Boys. Sorry thing is they are decent enough wrestlers, decent enough for Taven to get a "thank you" chant at least once, just a little too hyped for fans' tastes.
</li><li> The Decade was a fairly well received group, until BJ Whitmer's feud with Steve Corino became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor">Plot Tumor</a>. Then Jimmy Jacobs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoderickStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoderickStrong">Roderick Strong</a> left the group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">in protest to</a> Whitmer brainwashing Steven's son Colby, making Whitmer the focal point of Decade, which combined with his deteriorating work rate made him the recipient of much X-Pac Heat. His feuds with Mr. Wrestling III and Adam Page did slowly get some fan investment, although the insertion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSullivan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSullivan">Kevin Sullivan</a> into their feud was a point of contention.
</li><li> Kenny King got some during his return to Ring of Honor on account of his departure involving him vacating the tag team titles in exchange for a TNA tryout. During the <em>Road to Best in the World</em>, his partner, Rhett Titus, started to pick up a little as well, since some fans were of the opinion the All Night Express had served their purpose by losing to War Machine so they could call themselves linear champions in addition to holding the belts and it was time for ANX to step aside for better teams. Then Caprice Coleman joined them, fans being of the opinion his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyWastedAPerfectlyGoodPlot">better served with</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaltonCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaltonCastle">Dalton Castle</a> feud, reuniting with Cedric Alexander or following up on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PrinceNana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PrinceNana">Prince Nana</a>'s offer. Finally, the three men's Cabinet introduction promo "to make wrestling great again" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster">went on so long</a> it took away from the main event between Jay Lethal and Jay Briscoe, a rematch a year in the making. During the promo "This is awesome!" became "This is boring!" and <em>that</em> became "Wrap it up!". The Cabinet were saved from this when they became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> as The Rebellion, a group more about action than displays or speeches. This worked well enough for King to eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turn face</a> against popular heel Silas Young.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EnzoAndCass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EnzoAndCass">Enzo and Cass</a> got this from the very moment they showed up in Ring Of Honor. WWE had been actively raiding the ROH roster for over a year by that point, giving those in the Honor Nation who hadn't been following the wrestlers to NXT a decidely anti WWE attitude and even those who did follow their favorites to NXT considered Enzo and Cass in particular to be hasbeens unworthy of ROH. Even fans who did not keep up with WWE happenings and had little clue who they were hated them immediately on principal for distracting them from the always anticipated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a>, and that sentiment seemed to extend beyond the fanbase and into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> itself, who were not informed of Enzo and Cass's arrival. This perceieved attempt to get two "unknowns" over at one of their biggest star's expense without telling them beforehand, much less getting approval, had NJPW threatening to cut out ROH as the middleman and run its own USA shows independently, which in turn to that had fans who wanted New Japan Wrestlers to keep showing up on ROH cards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger">even angrier with Enzo and Cass</a>.

Being the son of promoter Verne, he already had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">a lot to overcome in the eyes of the fans</a> but managed to win them over until 1987, when Verne transparently created the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wrestling-titles.com/awa/awa-tv.html">AWA International Television Title<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for Greg to hold.

</li><li> Rush nicely demonstrates how "técnico" and "babyface" don't always mesh. CMLL started pushing him as an ultra badass after he won one of their annual body building contests, causing fans to believe he was being pushed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrejudicedForPecs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrejudicedForPecs">more for his look than his talent</a>. He kept the técnico designation even as he was getting booed more than most rudos. After teaming with the fast falling star of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LaSombra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LaSombra">La Sombra</a>, they became the most hated men in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">CMLL</a>, and were often booked in the manner of heels (while still insisting they were different kinds of técnicos). That said, CMLL booking him as a rudo in all but name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">eventually</a> did start getting him and his Los Ingobernables good heat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">in a sense</a>.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SaraDelRey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SaraDelRey">Sara Del Rey</a> turned heel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SHIMMER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SHIMMER">SHIMMER</a> brought in "Sweet and Sour" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LarrySweeney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LarrySweeney">Larry Sweeney</a> as her manager. Fans reacted so badly to the idea of a man being involved in the action as anything other than a referee that he was dropped after one appearance.
</li><li> While nobody in the industry really ever used the term "go away heat" up to that point, "Go Away!" is exactly what the fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> have chanted at Taichi Ishikari. He <em>has</em> gone away, getting over well enough in CMLL and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingNOAH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingNOAH">Pro Wrestling NOAH</a>, but he always comes back to New Japan, where he is best known as the most unpopular member of an unpopular stable.

</li><li> When the Chicago Cubs overcame a 3-1 deficit and ended the longest championship drought in the history of North American professional sports by defeating the Cleveland Indians in the 2016 World Series, fans who attended Absolute Intense Wrestling shows, which are almost entirely in Ohio, became enraged at the sight of anything related to Chicago for about a year, which included the usually popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana">Colt Cabana</a>.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JackSwagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JackSwagger">Jake Strong</a> signed with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground">Lucha Underground</a></em>, he was fairly well received at first. However, after losing his debut match, he started a massive win streak where he'd always snap his opponents' ankles with his ankle lock. As Strong continued to win matches and put more popular wrestlers on the shelf, his popularity continued to decline and his win streak became known by the fans as his "cutting a swathe of apathy." At the end of Season 4, where he won the Lucha Underground Championship, the fans chanted "bullshit."
</li><li> Sexy Star may have one of the best reasons of anyone on this page for having X-Pac Heat with the fans, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rosemary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rosemary">Rosemary</a> Incident. To wit, after applying a worked armbar to Rosemary, she then cranked it for real, spraining Rosemary's elbow and putting her out of action for 3 months. The fandom and her fellow wrestlers alike were outraged, and Sexy Star was promptly blackballed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LuchaUnderground">Lucha Underground</a>, Wrestle Circus, and every major wrestling promotion in the <em>world</em>.

The Godfather/Papa Shango/etc.</a>, and Mabel actually pinned Taker after Kama interfered in a particularly underwhelming finish). By the time Mabel and Savio Vega faced off in the finals, Philadelphia finally started chanting "ECW! ECW! ECW!" in protest and Mabel had trash thrown at him by the crowd during his coronation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">The lesson? Don't go into Philadelphia with a terrible show.</a>
</li><li> December to Dismember 2006, the first and <em>only</em> pay per view exclusive to WWE's rebooted ECW brand (dubbed "WWECW" by fans). Said brand had its share of problems, such as the phasing out of ECW originals like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sabu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sabu">Sabu</a> (released after the first post-WrestleMania ECW) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimFullington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimFullington">The Sandman</a> (drafted to Raw in the 2008 draft and released months later), the stricter WWE rules, the untimely suspension of the first champion of the new ECW, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam">Rob Van Dam</a>, the sudden release of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> due to substance abuse, and everything that happened with the late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisBenoit">Chris Benoit</a>. Not to mention that it quickly became a C-show to <em>Raw</em> and <em>SmackDown</em>. But <em>December to Dismember</em>, held in Augusta, Georgia, was rock bottom for the roster. The undercard had a skeleton crew of perennial midcarders and no-names like Sylvester Terkay<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15zyh2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15zyh2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15zyh2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a legit fighter who had been big in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingZero1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ProWrestlingZero1">Pro Wrestling ZERO1</a> when it was big and pushed hard in OVW but WWE made sure he'd never get over again by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">repackaging</a> him as a white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Umaga">Umaga</a> on their main roster</span>, Kevin Thorn and Mike Knox, plus a pre-commentary Matt Striker going against one of the few ECW originals on the show, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BallsMahoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BallsMahoney">Balls Mahoney</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">Matt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Jeff Hardy</a> versus MNM was inexplicably added despite neither team being on this roster (and oddly, it was one of the <em>only matches advertised</em> besides the main event). And then Sabu was taken out backstage and replaced in the main event with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobHolly">Hardcore Holly</a></em>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16ck7d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16ck7d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16ck7d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some explanation. Rumor has it that WWE viewed Sabu as being "useless" and Vince McMahon himself wanted Hardcore Holly to replace Sabu in the match for Lashley to have more villains to overcome.</span> and the fans saw right through it. Thus, Holly joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a>, Van Dam, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobbyLashley">Bobby Lashley</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Test" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Test">Test</a></em> in the Extreme Elimination Chamber main event. Punk had quickly gotten a huge fandom in WWE, so of course he was first eliminated, to a huge negative response. By the end, amidst "BULLSHIT" and "BORING" chants, it was Lashley, an obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> at the time, going over The Big Show to win the ECW title. By then, the Augusta crowd had long turned on the show, sometimes literally. The result was what fans called "the death of ECW," and the aftermath saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a> leaving the company, a <em>fraction</em> of the usual pay-per-view buyrate (partly thanks to WWE saturating the market with many PPVs at the time), WWE ending single-brand pay-per-views for eleven years, and the brand slowly dying.
</li><li> The 2014 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a></em> and the "Road to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em>" were crapped on repeatedly when part timer Batista came back and won the Rumble, being set to feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, who had not been truly been over as either a heel or face for years. At the same time this was going on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> was white hot with the crowd via the "Yes Movement". CM Punk quitting the company eventually led to a rewrite that saw Bryan enter a match against Triple H to gain entry into the WrestleMania main event, which he won.
<ul><li> The Royal Rumble reaction was particularly jarring for the company as it took place in Pittsburgh, which is a city that has a historical reputation for quiet/passive crowds. The intensity of the anger was more akin to something you'd see in cross state Philly.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2015 <em>Royal Rumble</em> match was another absolute travesty that was completely panned by the audience in - where else? - Philadelphia. After massive pops for Daniel Bryan, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a> (among others), the quick eliminations of those three inevitably led to Roman Reigns, who had rapidly been losing fan support after some less-than-stellar ring work coming back from injury on top of having some of the worst promos of 2014, winning the Rumble. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rusev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Rusev">Rusev</a>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignWrestlingHeel">anti-America heel</a>, was cheered on by the fans when he surprisingly appeared towards the end of the Rumble, not having been eliminated after all. Not even an appearance by The Rock could calm the crowd down. Fans were so furious that #CancelWWENetwork was the #1 trend on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> <em>worldwide</em>, and the page where customers could cancel their WWE Network subscriptions crashed due to heavy traffic. You've got to wonder how incompetent management has to be to book the Rumble like this, especially after the debacle of the Rumble the previous year, and in <em>Philadelphia</em> no less. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">The lesson</a>? <em>Don't</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">go into Philadelphia with a terrible show</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> is a case of not having any heat to begin with, becoming very popular, getting X-Pac Heat with both barrels, shaking it off in an odd way, getting it back, and losing it again.
<ul><li> When he debuted, Cena didn't really have a gimmick, except perhaps "ruthless aggresssion", and fans were pretty apathetic towards Cena. Then, on a Halloween episode of <em>SmackDown</em>, WWE decided to run with a joke impression he did as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce">Vanilla Ice</a>, which eventually gave Cena a rapper gimmick and turned him into the Doctor of Thuganomics, which was very over. Then came his first world championship win at WrestleMania 21 against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield">JBL</a>, where a lot of people became convinced that Cena just couldn't wrestle. Between feuds with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>, Cena's X-Pac Heat really took off. Not helping matters was his abandonment of the Thuganomics gimmick, which if nothing else had been a good source of legitimately funny smack talk whenever Cena cut a promo, replaced by an '80s-style babyface with a gimmick similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> of an all-American hero. Cena's matches also became rather generic, with most amounting to him getting beat up the entire time before suddenly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">"overcoming the odds"</a> with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveMovesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveMovesOfDoom">Five Moves of Doom</a>. The X-Pac Heat died down for a while, but never completely disappeared. A 2006 interview had Cena himself saying he'd rather drop down the card and redevelop his character, but wasn't being allowed to. The X-Pac Heat rose once again after he became the top star of WWE. The way WWE booked almost every single one of his feuding opponents since then only served to fuel the sentiment even further.
</li><li> The highlight of his X-Pac Heat was predicted to come during his <em>ECW One Night Stand</em> 2006 match against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam">Rob Van Dam</a>. Cena acknowledged and played to the negativity, acting as an effective heel if only for one month (going so far as to proclaim he'd beat Van Dam even if the ECW mutants rioted). Cena's character is still hated by many, but mostly because it is the product of poor booking. Cena himself has a large fanbase that eats up his merchandise at rates surpassed by very few other wrestlers, none of whom have had his longevity in the company.
</li><li> In 2011, "Cena Sucks" chants started to ring out during the shows of NWA promotions that never have and probably never will book John Cena, spontaneously, without any effort to work the crowds into it, putting him on the same level as the trope namer. Even more so after Cena claimed he would never wrestle for a promotion except WWE, saying it would be an insult to the WWE Championship during his otherwise hot feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a>. While some people took the line as sounding shockingly honest and felt he had the right to feel that way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">others resented him for it.</a>
</li><li> At the go-home show of 2013's TLC pay-per-view, it had gotten so bad that the audience practically ignored the in-ring characters and commentators' efforts to sell Cena's title-unification match against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>, the slated main event of TLC 2013, and instead kept chanting for Daniel Bryan.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18j6o0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18j6o0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18j6o0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Who was relegated to a mid-card match in the PPV.</span> Only due to Cena successfully piggybacking himself onto Bryan's popularity did the crowd give any attention to that main event.
</li><li> As of 2015, Cena started being booked lower on the card, feuding with Rusev over the United States Championship (his first title he won back in 2004). It didn't bring Cena all of his fans back, but when he won the title at WrestleMania 31, he began a weekly title defense of the United States Championship, putting on impressive matches against other mid-card wrestlers such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a>. The fans, while still mixed, started to realize Cena can actually pull off great matches, and enjoy not seeing him in the world title spotlight anymore. This went so far that when Cena was injured toward the end of 2015, even many smarks came to legitimately miss him, as WWE's next plan of building Roman Reigns as the next top face utterly failed and caused ratings to tank. Some even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">theorized</a> that Reigns' mega-push was actually one long, convoluted scheme to finally get Cena over with the hardcore fans.
</li><li> After 2017, Cena became a strictly part-time wrestler, turning his character more into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallObserver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallObserver">Fourth-Wall Observer</a> who acknowledged a few behind-the-scenes details and got meta in his promos against other wrestlers, which endeared him to the smart marks. Cena's tendency to acknowledge and make fun of the "Let's go Cena/Cena sucks" and "John Cena sucks!" chants also endear him to a great proportion of the smarkier fans who like the guy behind the character because he's talented enough to work through the bad booking, demonstrating the genuine performance abilities that are valued in pro wrestling. The fourth-wall breaking aspects of Cena's character in the PG Era and the fact he's nowhere near the world title scene anymore seemed to have finally broken Cena out of his X-Pac Heat.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a> is an interesting case of getting X-Pac Heat, shaking it off, and then getting it all over again:
<ul><li> He started off as a reality star of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRealWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRealWorld">The Real World</a></em>, where it was made pretty obvious that he was a <em>massive</em> fan of wrestling and WWE. He got onto a season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEToughEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWEToughEnough">WWE Tough Enough</a></em> where the winner is given a WWE contract. He was popular on <em>Tough Enough</em> but didn't win. Yet the winner disappeared and The Miz was pushed as the new star. Back then, The Miz had little mic ability, even less wrestling ability, and constantly made an idiot out of himself. Crowds loathed him, the locker room (JBL in particular) hazed the shit out of him, and he was constantly put into embarrassing matches and gimmicks. However, when he teamed up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnMorrison">John Morrison</a> and drastically improved his mic and in-ring skills, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">he earned some respect</a>. Then he became WWE Champion, and the IWC wanted to strangle him with his newly acquired belt. Despite his improved in-ring skills, The Miz still isn't believed to be that good. Now there's a split between (a) hatred and (b) being happy to finally have a vulnerable champion after years of unstoppable supermen holding the belt. What grates some people about his championship run is that literally up until the week before he won it, he was treated as a worthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>, and even after winning it, he still hadn't lost that status completely. Some find his character and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> grating and full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a> considering that he's supposed to be the top heel in the business, and the fact that he practically had to murder both Randy Orton and John Cena before he could be seen as a legitimate threat, and both of the two were already pretty badly beaten when he got involved. It isn't so much that some hate him, it's that they wish he would be allowed to be a credible heel, or that the belt could have been given to somebody that was.
</li><li> When Alex Riley got (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a>) fired, for about two weeks, The Miz got the jump on Cena twice and beat the ever loving crap out of him. When WWE brought Riley back, The Miz went back to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">smug little shit</a>, much to everyone's annoyance. He's still being alternated between the two settings, and it must be admitted that aforementioned fan hatred for Michael Cole at the time probably didn't help, as Cole slobbered all over The Miz's knob at every opportunity.
</li><li> Some of the aforementioned problems, like Cole sucking up to The Miz, have been remedied. However, an ill-advised decision by WWE to revive the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Figure Four Leglock</a> and give it to The Miz as a finisher did no favors for his (already shaky) reputation in the eyes of wrestling purists. One can only imagine the firestorm that started when people started finding out that both the face turn and finisher were originally slated for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DolphZiggler">Dolph Ziggler</a>.
</li><li> 2016, however, was a very good year for The Miz. Despite taking the Intercontinental championship off of fan favorite Zack Ryder the night after the latter's WrestleMania win, he's brought a lot of credibility back to the title with how much he clearly values it. It culminated in him going to <em>SmackDown</em> during the brand split, cutting a passionate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">Worked Shoot</a> promo on <em>Talking Smack</em> (which also sparked an ongoing rivalry with General Manager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan">Daniel Bryan</a>) that was met with widespread acclaim from both casual fans and smarks alike, and having stellar championship matches with the likes of the aforementioned Ziggler and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a>. By the end of the year, he cemented himself as not only one of <em>SmackDown</em>'s top heels, but one of WWE's greatest modern heels, period.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>:
<ul><li> In the dud on the WrestleMania XX card, a match between Brock Lesnar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Bill Goldberg</a>, Lesnar was immediately showered with boos and chants of "You Sold Out", in reference to him retiring from wrestling to play football with the Minnesota Vikings.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1901fn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1901fn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1901fn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The fact that Goldberg was about to leave wrestling as well only made things worse.</span> This continued to an extent in Lesnar's brief return to wrestling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan</a> and IGF (where Lesnar had more bad matches), even his mixed martial arts career after he was picked up by UFC, where he humorously decided to cut a heel style promo after winning their heavyweight belt.
</li><li> It got so much worse for him after he ended the streak on April 6, 2014. Wrestlers and fans alike have been treating him worse than ever due to his attitude of only being in the company for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">the money</a>. The crowd didn't bother booing him till the next night, while wrestlers backstage treated him like a non-entity the night of, and both fans and wrestlers alike treated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> with the respect due to being a legit legend, even though Taker ended up in an ambulance shortly after getting backstage. The hate came out in spades when he came out the next night on <em>Raw</em>. The look on Lesnar's face made it clear that he was <em>not</em> used to the raw hatred he was being shown even though he was trying to play it off by acting like a heel was supposed to. Made worse by all the media coverage of the event, from the Internet to newspapers to even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonStewart">Jon Stewart</a> appearing to be upset at the situation, though he seemed to be only half joking at the time on his broadcast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a></em> later on that same night as the <em>Raw</em> broadcast.
</li><li> Things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">later changed</a> for Lesnar. Despite holding the WWE Championship with a potential return to UFC rumored after WrestleMania 31, Lesnar began to lose his X-Pac Heat in part thanks to the fallout of the 2015 Royal Rumble and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>' victory. WWE's failure during the Road to WrestleMania to get Reigns over with the crowds combined with the extraordinary mic skills of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/PaulHeyman">Paul Heyman</a> has turned Lesnar's X-Pac Heat into legit face heat. Furthermore, there was much jubilation in the IWC when Lesnar revealed that he had re-signed with WWE.
</li><li> Back again to some extent after his matches in 2016. <em>SummerSlam '14</em>? Awesome due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatharsisFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatharsisFactor">Catharsis Factor</a> of Cena finally getting squashed in a match. Rollins? He was playing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> heel anyway and 2015 had the rematches with 'Taker. 2016 was where the pattern of every Lesnar match since breaking the streak became a problem and he delivered a dull match at Wrestlemania against Dean Ambrose. In the summer, Brock made a one-night return to UFC and failed two drug tests while preparing, confirming what many suspected for years. WWE did nothing to punish Brock, revealing that part-time wrestlers are exempt from their drug tests, which pissed fans off big time, especially since WWE had been handing out suspensions like Halloween candy to other superstars who failed drug tests, including Roman Reigns. Then at <em>SummerSlam '16</em>, he beat up the returning Randy Orton badly enough that he was left in a pool of his own blood, had a legitimate concussion, several staples in his head and missed his next PPV appearance (to the point that Chris Jericho was ready to <em>get into a real fight</em> over the Orton fiasco). The overprotective nature of his booking which makes an already seemingly invincible monster look even stronger, plus the repetitive nature of his squash matches, has led to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy</a> regarding his feuds now, since it's hard to get invested when he's going to walk all over whatever Face they feed to him next. It's reached the point where the returning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Goldberg">Goldberg</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note200ble');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note200ble" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note200ble');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Who despite being massively popular in his time has developed a hatedom amongst smarks due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a></span> has consistently gotten cheered over him, the sole exception being in Lesnar's home state of Minnesota.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2182wi');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2182wi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2182wi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Goldberg's own case was helped by both nostalgia and the plain emotion he let show on his face on his return to <em>Raw</em> and that his promo came off as heartfelt and sold the crowd on the match. And the only notable time Lesnar was cheered was at his hometown.</span> And then Goldberg squashed Lesnar in a minute during their rematch at <em>Survivor Series</em>, to the enjoyment of many fans.
</li><li> It came back with a vengeance in 2017, when he won the Universal Championship. Many despised him once again because he rarely defended the title, along with the fact that his run surpassed CM Punk's record for longest world champion reign in modern WWE history.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> has become such an extreme case of X-Pac Heat that if the term X-Pac Heat weren't so ingrained in the fandom, the trope could easily be renamed Reigns Heat:
<ul><li> During his time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a>, Reigns was immensely popular. However, while he was in the stable, he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> to cover for his weaknesses on the microphone and in the ring, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LukeHarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LukeHarper">Luke Harper</a> selling his offense and making him look awesome. Once The Shield broke up, Reigns was exposed as an inexperienced and poor worker with terrible mic skills. Since the break up, WWE management has been relentless in their attempts to make Reigns the new top babyface of the entire promotion. Many fans believed that he was only being pushed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">because of his look</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">because he's a member of the Anoa'i family</a>. As a result, many fans turned against him. WWE has tried various methods over the years to get the fans behind him. While some of them worked temporarily, in the long run, the extreme effort they're going through to force Reigns down the fans' throats has only served to turn them further against him. And unlike John Cena above, Reigns' response to fans' dislike of him could best be described as smug nastiness.
</li><li> The first time the heat kicked up was after he was out for several months starting in late 2014, and put right back into the main event slot as though he'd never left in the first place. He won the Royal Rumble in 2015 to a terrible reaction. WWE had apparently anticipated the fans' displeasure with the Rumble finish, and sent out The Rock, his cousin, to congratulate him after the match. <em>The Rock was booed</em>.
</li><li> Following that, he was moved into a feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a>, a fellow recipient of fan disinterest. This sorta got the good heat back on Reigns, but only in the sense that they preferred him to Sheamus, not actually liking him. And as if to rub it in the face of the fans that Reigns was the next big thing, he was given a stable of his own to combat Sheamus' League of Nations, called The Roman Empire, featuring The Usos and Dean Ambrose as Reigns' lackeys. When Reigns eventually won the feud with Sheamus, the negative reactions came right back.
</li><li> The heat came back <strong>hard</strong> after he pinned Ambrose for a #1 Contender's spot for Triple H's title. The angle went down <em>very</em> badly: Reigns was written off of TV after a brutal beatdown by Triple H (in a sense of irony stemming from the Authority's example on this page, when Triple H, the face of one of the most hated angles in the company, beat down Reigns, <em>the audience cheered Triple H</em>), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ambrose</a> was booked in his place.
</li><li> Then there was the failed drug test in June 2016. When he returned, he started taking more clean pinfalls. This, ironically, led to him being better received in general by the fans, who thought Reigns as an angry upper-midcarder with an unclear agenda was better than Reigns as a bland babyface main eventer. So of course it was decided that Reigns had paid enough dues and was pushed back into the main event scene. Although he didn't win the title from champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinOwens">Kevin Owens</a>, he did manage to both repeatedly make Owens look like a chump and completely overshadow him.
</li><li> How pervasive was Reigns' X-Pac Heat? He was 2016's winner of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pro_Wrestling_Illustrated_awards#Most_Hated_Wrestler_of_the_Year">Pro Wrestling Illustrated's "Most Hated Wrestler of the Year" award<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an award traditionally reserved for heels. The only other comparable instance of this happening was when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RobVanDam">Rob Van Dam</a> won the "Most Popular" award during his heel run in the "Invasion" angle.
</li><li> Then comes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> 2017. Not only was he in the championship match against Kevin Owens for the WWE Universal title, but despite losing, he was the 30th entrant in the Royal Rumble match rather than the widely speculated/requested Finn Bálor, Samoa Joe, or Kurt Angle. A collective crowd calling "Bullshit" was the response and it got worse as he eliminated <em>The Undertaker</em> singlehandedly. When Randy Orton (who, being a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily">The Wyatt Family</a>, was technically a heel) eliminated him to win his second Royal Rumble, it was met with widespread cheers. The sheer audacity of putting Reigns in the Rumble at all despite knowing how poorly it went the last two years leads one to suspect that WWE <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">expected the crowd to unanimously boo Reigns and cheer the winner</a>, regardless of who it was.
</li><li> Reigns' X-Pac Heat became utterly nuclear once he defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> at WrestleMania 33. The crowd chants he received - <em>for almost <strong>fifteen</strong> straight minutes</em> - on the first <em>Raw</em> after WrestleMania ranged from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MattHardy">"Delete!"</a> to "Roman sucks!" to "Fuck you, Roman!" to even "Go! A-way!" Even the commentators acknowledged that Reigns was booed out of the building.
</li><li> Reigns actually has <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_and_reception_of_Roman_Reigns">a second page<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> dedicated to cataloguing his career trajectory thanks to the extraordinary levels of hatred he's received. The reason is that in Reigns' case WWE are fully aware that he's massively hated, but rather than attempt to correct it as they have with unpopular wrestlers in the past, they've intentionally adopted a "screw the fans" mentality, repeatedly forcing him down the throats of the unwilling and unhappy audience out of spite and attempting to restructure the narrative to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">portray Reigns as the most-successful wrestler in the company</a> because he gets the biggest and most-passionate reactions, irrespective of the fact that he's getting <em>completely the wrong ones</em>. They're basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IRejectYourReality">denying the existence of</a> X-Pac Heat because of a stubborn refusal to be dictated to by the fans. On the bright side, despite being booked as a face, Reigns is now capable of getting <em>any</em> wrestler cheered.
</li><li> In 2018, not even reuniting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> has been able to reverse the trend. They get cheered by the crowd...except for when Reigns is on the mic, at which point it turns to boos. The main reason for this is that reuniting the stable is a transparent attempt by WWE to get Ambrose and Rollins' "good" heat to rub off on Reigns, and the fans can see right through it.
</li><li> The amount of heat Reigns received suddenly all hit the fans when on the October 22, 2018 episode of <em>Raw</em>, Reigns, who had entered to his usual affair of heat, suddenly announced that he was vacating the Universal Championship after being <em>legitimately</em> re-diagnosed with leukemia, and would be going on hiatus to treat it. The mostly negative reception <em>immediately</em> turned into an overwhelmingly positive amount of cheering in support for Reigns, even with the crowd breaking into chants of "Thank you, Roman!" and being embraced at the ramp by Ambrose and Rollins, both of whom were visibly shaken at the announcement. Reigns would not appear on WWE TV again until the February 25, 2019 episode of <em>Raw</em>, where he announced that he had entered into remission, which again received an overwhelmingly positive reaction, as despite the hatred fans had for the character, there was immense respect for him as a performer, and many were just happy to see him in a much better place health-wise.
</li><li> The positive responses didn't last long after his return, though - by his first post-return pay per view match, he was already getting mixed reactions leaning towards boos. That being said, by the end of 2019, it has mostly mellowed out for him. Much like Cena, Joe Anoa'i is respected by fans as they do see strides in his workrate and mic skills, and it also helps that he isn't force fed in the main event as much as he used to be.
</li><li> Amazingly, after fans had largely given up on the idea that Reigns would ever turn heel again, Reigns returned at the end of <em>SummerSlam</em> 2020 (after taking several months off due to the COVID-19 pandemic) by attacking both Bray Wyatt and Braun Strowman after their Universal Championship match. The following Friday, Reigns revealed that he had allied himself with Paul Heyman, before winning back the championship at Payback after signing the contract <em>as the match was well underway</em> and continuing to beat up both Wyatt and Strowman, <em>thus solidifying himself as a <strong>heel</strong> for the first time since 2014</em>. Fan reaction to this turn so far has been largely positive.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie">Eva Marie</a>:
<ul><li> She gets boos just for getting tagged into a match. She got a lot of exposure in the ring and on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em>, but it led to her getting her own hatedom. If they gave her a mic, she could reach Vickie Guerrero levels of heat soon. It's debatable how much of it has been intentional on WWE's part, given that one of her first onscreen appearances had her slapping Jerry Lawler for pronouncing her name wrong  and their efforts to portray her as an over-ambitious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> on <em>Total Divas</em>.
</li><li> It was a conscious attempt to garner heel heat, portraying her as a selfish model type character who didn't care about wrestling or want to learn, playing into fan perception of "bad" Divas. Unfortunately, doing this was the ultimate way to garner "go away" heat. Ideally, that "go away" heat would have just been directed at the Eva Marie character, which would have made it easy to turn into straight heel heat, but unfortunately her early matches showed her as someone who hadn't even properly learned how to take moves yet, which cemented her status as someone the fans just absolutely hated. She took a break from wrestling for a while, most likely to train, and tried to reconvert that X-Pac Heat into legit heel heat, showing off a very heelish entrance on NXT in August 2014, playing up the fact that this is a character much more strongly. Whether the fans will start booing the character rather than the performer remains to be seen.
</li><li> Quite a lot of Eva's X-Pac Heat comes from the fact that unlike other Divas, she essentially debuted through <em>Total Divas</em>. Fans utterly loathe this for two main reasons: one, the success of <em>Total Divas</em> means that it's highly unlikely that any of the Divas on it will be fired or dropped down to NXT— even the ones who can't wrestle, are despised by the fans, or who are essentially useless.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22fzbd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22fzbd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22fzbd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The one exception, JoJo, was dropped down to NXT because when the first season aired, she was only nineteen, too young to be on the main roster.</span> While it could be argued that <em>Total Divas</em> is simply being used as a way to flesh out the characters of some of the less hyped Divas, it could also be argued that as a result, the matches on the main shows are being used to continue those story lines when there are some very talented Divas who aren't on the show who are just as, if not more deserving of those matches  in other words, being on the show means that Eva's getting preferential treatment over Divas who are adored by the fans. And two, she sucks in the ring and has pretty much no character besides the show. If she'd come through NXT, the fans would probably still hate her, but at least she would have actually had some experience. Instead, while it's true that she has improved, the fact still remains that compared to Divas like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> (who's been wrestling since she was a teenager) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a> (who's had years of experience in the indies), Eva has no idea what she's doing, but she's still being hyped as someone just as good as them.
</li><li> In the summer of 2015, Eva started training with retired wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LondonAndKendrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LondonAndKendrick">Brian Kendrick</a> in an attempt to improve her in-ring skills. She then joined the roster of NXT. The higher-ups expected the fans to get behind Eva as she was showing signs that she knew she was a poor in-ring performer and wanted to improve. Needless to say, this didn't work and the X-Pac Heat got even worse. Depending on who you ask, her in-ring skills didn't improve either. To make matters worse, it was widely expected at the time that Eva would be booked to win the NXT Women's Championship from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a>, who had just put on <em>two</em> Match of the Year candidates with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks">Sasha Banks</a>.
</li><li> During one match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillieKay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillieKay">Billie Kay</a>, Eva forgot to kick out of a pin. The referee scrambled to declare that she got her shoulder up (she didn't) and Eva proceeded to hit her finisher for the win. Between the botched pin and the finish, the audience booed for a solid minute, not even breaking to chant against Eva. Since that botch, WWE seems to be trying to make her character into someone who doesn't actually care about wrestling and gets help from iffy ref decisions. She has cut promos from Paris saying (quite disingenuously) how much she misses wrestling, and they seem to be purposefully playing up the 'refs cheat for her' angle (in the botch match, the commentators didn't mention the obvious failure to kick out, but since then, the face announcers have been very quick to call out the refs). Now, WWE has changed her gimmick into a delusional heel, which is seen by fans as a retread of Bo Dallas' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> without any of the aspects that made the Dallas turn effective.
</li><li> The heat reached its zenith on the November 18, 2015 edition of NXT  when she came out to issue her title challenge to Bayley, the Full Sail crowd booed her so loudly that she couldn't get her promo out and Bayley, who was standing right next to her, couldn't even hear Eva even though she had a mic. Bayley even tried to calm the crowd down herself. At this point, she's getting more nuclear heat than Vickie Guerrero or heel Michael Cole circa-2011 ever did.
</li><li> She decided to follow in Lita's footsteps and leave wrestling over the negative reactions. After a wellness policy violation in August 2016, she never returned to the ring, opted not to return to <em>Total Divas</em> in July 2017, and in August 2017 finally was released from the company.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>:
<ul><li> Batista got X-Pac Heat for a while, with his match with The Big Show on ECW being his worst offense, but it was nothing compared to the backlash over him winning the Royal Rumble in 2014 when fan favorite Daniel Bryan wasn't even in the match. It certainly didn't help that he had been back on television for less than a week beforehand after being gone since 2010 and won the Royal Rumble altogether, which in WWE parlance is the biggest push a wrestler can receive.
</li><li> Though the latter was more due to revulsion with the WWE creative team than Batista himself (case in point, when Rey Mysterio came out at number 30 the boos started hard and heavy, which almost <em>never</em> happens to Rey). Batista winning was just twisting the knife (since it was only his second appearance since his 2014 return), although he certainly seemed to take it poorly (reportedly flipping off fans and mocking the "YES!" chants with his middle fingers before walking backstage). By February 2014, his appearances were literally greeted by fans chanting "BOO-TISTA!", NXT audiences chanting "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">BETTER THAN BATISTA!</a>" any time anyone did a powerbomb, and by cheers for his opponents Roman Reigns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AlbertoDelRio">Alberto Del Rio</a>, and Randy Orton  the last of which was <em>the top heel of the company</em> at the time  thus leading to Batista's undergoing a quickie heel turn and Daniel Bryan being inserted into the main event.
</li><li> Batista was part of a growing trend of fans turning on what they see as "part-time" wrestlers, similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, Brock Lesnar, and others, who burst onto the scene in a titanic comeback and leap into the main event scene while performing only a handful of dates each year. But while The Undertaker is one of the most popular superstars of the past two decades and fans expect him to focus on his famous WrestleMania winning streak matches, and Brock Lesnar and The Rock wrestle in special marquee matches and stay far from the world title scene with their appearances being that of "special guests", Batista reappeared after a four year absence and won the Royal Rumble less than a week later over several more popular and tenured wrestlers, putting himself into the <em>WrestleMania</em> main event. Fans turn on these types of appearances because they feel that even though they used to be main event stars, these part-timers haven't earned the main event status they're given back as though they never left. The fact that the past several <em>WrestleManias</em> have been headlined primarily by part-time performers only adds fuel to the fire, and this latest example at the 2014 Royal Rumble is a popular reason given by wrestling news sites for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> walking out on the company the day after the event.
</li><li> Batista did a good job of turning that into actual X-Pac Heat. His work rate hadn't measured up to the current roster, the matches he had since the Royal Rumble had shown him tiring quickly and botching simple moves like clotheslines, and of course, telling fans that he was going to main event <em>WrestleMania</em> and that they should just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Memes/WWE">deal with it</a> didn't help him either. That said, he later expressed in interviews that he had wanted to come back as a heel in the first place and was telling creative that instantly plugging him in as the top face would go over like a fart in a church, calling himself the worst babyface in the history of wrestling. Thus it's entirely likely he intentionally acted like a heel every chance he could from the moment he first got booed until the company finally caved and made him one.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite generally being well liked by casual fans and smarks alike, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio Jr.</a> has fallen afoul of X-Pac Heat three times:
<ul><li> The first time was during his run with the aforementioned No Limit Soldiers (later the Filthy Animals) in WCW. The No Limit Soldiers were a rap themed stable that were supposed to be anti-heroes but really just came across as heels. The Filthy Animals eventually turned heel. It didn't help that Mysterio was terrible at playing a heel.
</li><li> The second was in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">CMLL</a> and tied into the WCW angle above. Mysterio was feuding with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Psicosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Psicosis">Psychosis</a> in CMLL, and the original plan was to build to a mask vs. mask match with Psychosis winning Mysterio's mask. However, when CMLL got word that Mysterio had already been unmasked in WCW, they forbade Mysterio from wrestling with his mask on. This forced the feud to be rebooked to a much less meaningful stipulation, and Mysterio ended up winning the match and feud. Masks are taken very seriously in Mexico and allowing himself to be unmasked in WCW was considered a serious cultural faux pas, and the fact that Psychosis had held out against pressure to unmask in WCW made Mysterio look even worse in comparison.
</li><li> The third was at the 2014 <em>Royal Rumble</em>, and wasn't Mysterio's fault per se. The fans wanted to see Daniel Bryan in the Rumble, and when Mysterio came out at #30, he ended up being the recipient of the vitriol of the pissed off fans. The sad thing is it's likely that WWE realized whoever came out at #30 was going to anger the fans, and they chose Rey for it because they thought he might be able to still get cheered.
</li></ul></li><li> An unusual example of this came in "Not Daniel Bryan" heat, whereas anyone who got scapegoated for WWE's bad booking of Bryan (by either squashing him in a match or being essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Replacement Scrappy</a> for him) unfairly got booed out of the area. Amongst those offenders include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a> (for "18 Seconds"), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a> (for his 2013-14 title reign when he cashed in MITB on Bryan right after he beat Cena), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a> (when he was shoved into Bryan's spot as Orton's main title challenger), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterioJr">Rey Mysterio Jr.</a> (for being #30 in the 2014 Royal Rumble when it became clear Bryan would not be in the match that year), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> (for winning that year's Rumble and being pushed in Bryan's place as the main anti-Authority babyface), and of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Carmella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Carmella">Carmella</a>:
<ul><li> She first suffered this when she debuted in <em>NXT</em>. Fans weren't happy about her repeated botches in the ring, and found her bitchy heel gimmick to be grating and unfitting for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EnzoAndCass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EnzoAndCass">Enzo and Cass</a>, whom she debuted as a valet for. Eventually, she managed to shake this off by turning fully face and not wrestling as much, instead relying on her mic skills to get her over when she debuted on the main roster as a heel, although a far more proactive and less grating one. Ironically, what may have rescued her from the pits in the first place was getting injured by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvaMarie">Eva Marie</a>, an even <em>bigger</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy</a>. She even won the Women's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> briefcase (albeit first with some interference, but she also won it again alone) for <em>SmackDown</em>, cutting an epic promo defending the act of James Ellsworth unhooking the case for her as a heel masterstroke which she called for, and seemed to be pegged to be a future star if she could improve in the ring
</li><li> That was, until she actually won the <em>SmackDown</em> Women's Championship, and the fans soured on her again. To many fans, the requirements of a champion to have repeated longer matches exposed her relative lack of improvement in the ring, and for all her character ability, her wrestling talent was subpar, especially in comparison to her challengers. For the most part, it died down after she turned face and formed a comedy-based alliance with R-Truth.

<ul><li> This sort of heat sometimes gets attached to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGiant">giant</a>, especially if they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler">bad fundamentals</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingPsychology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrestlingPsychology">psychology</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EricBischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> theorized on his <em>83 Weeks</em> podcast that the reason why giants have trouble getting over—whether it be as heels or faces—is because their sheer size makes it hard for audiences to relate to them. Having them sell for smaller, weaker opponents doesn't make them believable babyfaces (since heels put in most of the offense in a match), but they can't get any real heel heat since they don't have to resort to cheating in order to beat down said smaller, weaker opponents. He said this was the reason why guys like Paul Wight (see below) tend to undergo the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">HeelFace Revolving Door</a> quite a bit:
<ul><li> WWE fans have nicknamed Paul Wight (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotCallMePaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotCallMePaul">a.k.a.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBigShow">The Big Show</a>) "The Big Slow". In one of the rare examples of escaping X-Pac Heat, The Big Show took some time off, dropped 50 pounds and got in shape, and came back. Unfortunately for The Big Show, he fell back into this by 2015, as he never quite shook off the sour taste of the infamous 2015 <em>Royal Rumble</em>. For the next several months, chants of "PLEASE RETIRE" haunted him at arenas. Then he lost even more weight, got into the best shape of his life, and escaped X-Pac Heat <em>a second time</em>.
</li><li> Former WWE wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGreatKhali" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheGreatKhali">The Great Khali</a> used to get "You can't wrestle!" chants back when he was a plodding monster heel being pushed to beat up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> and win the World Heavyweight Title. Khali didn't get over until they pulled him down the card, overhauled him into a fun babyface character nicknamed "The Punjabi Playboy", gave him a Bollywood-musical styled theme, and started having him host the Khali Kiss-Cam segments.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://rspw.org/faq/4-keithfaq.txt">R.S.P-W FAQ<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> explains X-Pac heat thusly: <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ywds');"><sup>Explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ywds" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ywds');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Section 0.1.11 </span> "There is also 'bad' heat, which is unintended negative heat. When either a face or a heel draws bad heat, it is generally not because of any actions done by the character, but simply because the fans can no longer tolerate the person. [...] the fans are simply tired of seeing them and boo out of frustration rather than genuine dislike of anything they say. Bad heat is considered undesirable because it can actually hurt the drawing power of the person receiving it, since it can never be resolved in the ring." Jeff Jarrett, Hulk Hogan, and Eric Bischoff, during their time in WCW, are cited as examples.
</li><li> Any time a wrestler develops a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a>, they run the risk of turning into one of these. Promoters <em>love</em> wrestlers who can draw in from a periphery demographic because it gets eyes and attention on the promotion that wouldn't usually be there. They then push the wrestler in question to make sure they're always there drawing in the periphery demographic. The main demographic will in turn begin resenting the wrestler, feeling their push is undeserved and because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanHater">the periphery demographic annoys them</a>. The classic example of this is Jeff Hardy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstrogenBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstrogenBrigade">his popularity with teenage girls</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23o514');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23o514" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23o514');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As noted in his entry in the Ring of Honor section.</span> This is also another reason why Roman Reigns was hated because female fans love him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrFanservice">for obvious reasons</a>.
</li><li> The wrestling fandom in general has gotten smarter to kayfabe and is more interested in what doesn't happen on shows after the collapse of the territorial system and particularly during the Monday Night Wars, which in fact were kicked off in part by X-Pac Heat. While the blame has occasionally been placed on the increased prevalence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">the internet</a>, which makes it almost impossible for casual fans and smarks to <em>not</em> interact, as explained in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhq-xFcDIjI">this editorial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, no matter the time or place, solid wrestling skills are the best way of getting over, and attempts to cover it up usually get wrestlers booed. Furthermore, while there are some wrestlers who manage to overcome this, there are many more who don't. What makes wrong heat look more prevalent in post-territorial wrestling is partial apathy. It's often not even noticed unless directed at a face, since heels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">are supposed to be booed</a>, and among corrective efforts taken, improvement to the product in ring are often the last things attempted. But just as a heel who no longer relies on shortcuts to win often has a successful face turn, sufficient ring work is almost always enough to dampen and even overcome X-Pac Heat.
</li><li> As mentioned above, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> and beyond several heel wrestlers have been booked to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">intentionally get X-Pac Heat</a>. This was discussed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimCornette">Jim Cornette</a> on his <em>Jim Cornette Experience</em> podcast; he theorized that because of the death of kayfabe, heels can't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectVillain">say or do truly vile things</a> to get heat anymore because all the blame will be put on the company instead of going to the wrestler like it should. Combined with the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire">a heel who is entertaining on the mic or good in the ring is likely to get cheered</a> because the fans know they are playing a character, X-Pac Heat is the only way for bookers to actually get the correct reaction for a heel.
