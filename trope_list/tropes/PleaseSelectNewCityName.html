Referring to a location by its old vs. its new name may be a way of declaring one's political allegiance. A Soviet-era joke has an older Russian filling out a form:

</li></ul><p>It's not always for political reasons though. For example, some Chinese place names have simply been changed due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WhyMaoChangedHisName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WhyMaoChangedHisName">new method of transliterating their "real" names</a> — neither "Peking" nor "Beijing" is an <em>entirely</em> accurate way of representing the Chinese word, due to language differences, but the latter is considerably closer than the former. Linguistic drift can also change names: The Roman province of Hispania became, over a thousand years later, the nation of Espania — Spain.
</p><p>Either way, expect to see some of the old names pop up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a>, as evidenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople">Istanbul (Not Constantinople)</a>.

In response, its sister city, Minas Anor ("Tower of the Sun") was renamed Minas Tirith ("Tower of Guard").
<ul><li> Similarly, the original Minas Tirith from the Silmarillion was on Tol Sirion (The Island of the Sirion, i.e. the Sirion river). After being taken over by Morgoth, and used by Sauron to breed werewolves, was renamed Tol-in-Gaurhoth or Isle of Werewolves.

There are also less frequent parodies of other name changes, such as the Soviet ones.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StrugatskyBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StrugatskyBrothers">Strugatsky Brothers</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HardToBeAGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HardToBeAGod">Hard to Be a God</a></em>, mentions a lot of villages being given more upbeat names in hopes of reforming them. It sounded like the attempt wasn't successful.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, this trope occurred on a massive scale when the extragalactic Yuuzhan Vong invaded the capital planet/global city of Coruscant, terraformed it into a humid jungle world, and renamed it Yuuzhan'tar, in an attempt to recreate their lost/destroyed original homeworld.
<ul><li> Earlier, Coruscant was renamed Imperial Center during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>'s rule and reverted to its traditional name under the New Republic. Only die-hard Imperials used the new name in the first place. It's been taken over by resurgences of the Empire and renamed Imperial Center <em>again</em> twice since then.
</li><li> Also, while the <em>planet</em> is called Coruscant, the city that covers it officially has another name, which changes from Galactic City to Imperial City to New Republic City. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPlanet">There's not much point in making the distinction anymore</a> so it doesn't come up much.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekNovelVerse">Star Trek Novel Verse</a>, the capital city of Romulus changes its name at some point in the early-mid 24th century. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVulcansHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekVulcansHeart">Star Trek: Vulcan's Heart</a></em>, the capital city was given the name Ki Baratan. It had previously been called Dartha, but that was in a story set a century prior. Later novels used the time gap for a reasonable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>: the capital's name changes as new regimes come to power. Now, books set in the 22nd or 23rd centuries use "Dartha", those set in the 24th use "Ki Baratan". The name change is explicitly mentioned in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekTitan">Star Trek: Titan</a></em> novel.
</li><li> As part of the rich and complex history presented in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> series, many cities and countries have changed over the last Age. For instance, the city of Al'cair'rahienallen, "The Hill of the Golden Dawn," is now known as Cairhien, because it's so much less of a mouthful. Closer to the plot is an ancient city of Aridhol, which became consumed by its own evil and became known as Shadar Logoth, "The Shadow's Waiting."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tigana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tigana">Tigana</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyGavrielKay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyGavrielKay">Guy Gavriel Kay</a>, the titular city-state is much damaged and renamed Lower Corte years before the opening of the book. Even the memory of that name is magically expunged from virtually everyone who didn't live there. The main plot of the book is about a quest to restore the city and its name. (Since it is a city-state, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirStripOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirStripOne">Air Strip One</a> also applies.)
</li><li> <em>Dominion</em> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> novel set in the 1950s where Lord Halifax becomes Prime Minister instead of Winston Churchill after Neville Chamberlain's resignation in 1940 and subsequently the UK becomes a satellite of Nazi Germany. Those resistant to Nazi rule, including most of the Royal Family, flee to other parts, many to Canada where the city of Halifax was renamed to Churchill.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiddleyWalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiddleyWalker">Riddley Walker</a></em>, all of the place names in the setting's post-apocalyptic Iron Age society have changed from their present-day equivalents. "Canterbury" has become "Cambry"; "Dargate", "Dog Et"; and "Dover", "Do It Over".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FireAndBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FireAndBlood">Fire &amp; Blood</a>:</em> The town of Stonebridge gets renamed Bitterbridge shortly after the crowning of Maegor, due to his first fight with the Faith Militant taking place there, which ends with the nearby river turning red due to all the blood.

<ul><li> In Brazilian telenovela <em>Saramandaia</em> (both the Seventies original and the 2013 remake), the ostensible dividing issue between two political factions is a proposal to change the town's name from "Bole-Bole" to "Saramandaia".
</li><li> Starling City is renamed Star City (which was its name in the comics, although see above for why that's complicated these days) in season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, in tribute to the believed-dead Ray Palmer.

In-character, this was done because "Specularum" was a name imposed by the Thyatians and raised bad feelings among the Traladaran populace, whom King Stephan wanted to appease; out-of-character, it's because one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR">TSR</a>'s female employees pointed out that "Specularum" sounds unpleasantly like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomensMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomensMysteries">gynecological implement</a>.

<p></p><h3>Southern Africa</h3>
<ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthAfrica">South Africa</a></strong>:
<ul><li> There is an ongoing controversial movement to change Pretoria's name to Tshwane. Pretoria is presently the name of the primary city of the municipality of Tshwane. Some politicians insist on renaming the city, but in a country with 11 official languages (seriously), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveManyNames">each with their own name for the city</a>, what would they call it?
</li><li> This is not the only city to experience a theoretical name change. Ask someone where 'Bela-bela' is and you'll get a blank look at best, but Warmbad is fairly well known. Many other examples exist in South Africa.
</li><li> In Durban, the city management embarked on a politically driven campaign to rename all of the streets in the city. Which all of the citizens promptly ignored. At present the renamed streets have signposts displaying both the new and the old names, and on some the new names have been spray painted over or removed.
</li></ul></li><li> South-West Africa used to be German before World War One, then it was taken over by South Africa for about 70 years. Now it's called <strong>Namibia</strong>.
</li><li> Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia became Harare in Zimbabwe.
</li><li> Northern Rhodesia became Zambia, though the major city was already Lusaka.
</li><li> Bechuanaland became <strong>Botswana</strong>.

</li><li> In 2018, Swaziland formally adopted the name eSwatini, marking the 50th anniversary of the country's independence. The name eSwatini was already in use, but now it is official.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Central Africa</h3>
<ul><li> Belgian Congo became the Republic of the Congo after gaining independence, but the name was changed to Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1964, probably because its neighbouring country, the former French Congo also chose the name "Republic of the Congo". The country was then renamed to Zaire between 1965 and 1997 but reverted to "Democratic Republic of the Congo" in 1998.
<ul><li> The Republic of the Congo itself was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny">People's Republic of the Congo</a> 1970-1992.
</li></ul></li><li> Ubangi-Shari =&gt; Central African Republic =&gt; Central African Empire =&gt; Central African Republic
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Western Africa</h3>
<ul><li> Dahomey =&gt; <strong>Benin</strong>. Confusingly, not the successor to the historical Benin Empire. It was named after the Bight of Benin, which it borders, which was in turn named after the empire. The name was chosen as a compromise between the Dahomey, Atakora, and Burgu ethnic groups which make up the nation.
<ul><li> Oddly enough, back when the southeastern regions of Nigeria seceded as Biafra, they established a puppet state out of Nigeria's Mid-Western Region, which is where the Benin Empire actually was, called the Republic of Benin.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12rdu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12rdu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12rdu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Back then, the modern-day Benin was known as Dahomey, eliminating the confusion.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Gold Coast =&gt; <strong>Ghana</strong>. Also named after a historical kingdom which was actually somewhere else (its furthest southern reach was a few kilometers north of current Ghana's northern border; any attempt to connect to the historical entity via ethnicity is also spurious, since very few of historical Ghana's dominant Soninke people live in modern Ghana, which is dominated by the unrelated Ashanti, Fanti, Akan, Guan, and Ewe peoples.
</li><li> Ivory Coast =&gt; Côte d'Ivoire (It means the same thing but has become the preferred form in English)
</li><li> Upper Volta =&gt; Burkina Faso
</li><li> Spanish Sahara =&gt; Western Sahara
</li><li> Spanish Guinea =&gt; Equatorial Guinea (though it bore its current name during the last few years of Spanish rule in the 1960s).
</li><li> Portuguese Guinea =&gt; Guinea-Bissau
</li><li> Averted with Angola and Mozambique, both named after indigenous leaders (Queen Ngola Nzinga of the Kimgdom of the Congo and Moza Alambique of Mozambique Island, respectively). The names "Portuguese West Africa" (Angola) and "Portuguese East Africa" (Mozambique) were both English-language exonyms unknown to the average Portuguese or Angolan/Mozambican, then or now.
</li><li> In Angola:
<ul><li> Fort Huambo -&gt; Nova Lisboa -&gt; Huambo
</li><li> Moçâmedes (after a Baron) -&gt; Namibe (after the desert, which also names Namibia) -&gt; Moçâmedes (although here the colonial name was always popular)
</li><li> Vila Salazar (after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntonioDeOliveiraSalazar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntonioDeOliveiraSalazar">the Portuguese dictator</a>) -&gt; N'dalatando
</li><li> São Salvador do Congo -&gt; M'Banza Kongo
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>Eastern Africa</h3>
<ul><li> Abyssinia =&gt; Ethiopia
</li><li> Tanganyika and Zanzibar =&gt; Tanzania (although that one was a portmanteau of two former colonies that united into one independent country)
</li><li> British East Africa got the name <strong>Kenya</strong> as far back as 1920, decades before independence; that was, however, <em>also</em> confusion-related, as the British had just taken Tanganyika—immediately to the south—from the Germans, and "British East Africa" could now refer to that as well, so the Brits decided to take the opportunity to make the old East Africa protectorate a Crown Colony called Kenya. Under British control, the country's name was pronounced "Keen-ya", and you will still find older Brits who say it this way. However, the locals have always called it "Ken-ya" and it's been generally called this internationally since gaining independence.
</li><li> After the independence, many major cities of <strong>Madagascar</strong> changed their names to Malagasy-sounding ones. There were several distinct reasons though:
<ul><li> The city already had a Malagasy name but the French colonists translated it. Examples: <em>Antananarivo</em> (Tananarive), <em>Mahajanga</em> (Majunga) and <em>Toliary</em> (Tuléar)
</li><li> The city already had a Malagasy name but the French colonists created another one from scratch. Example: <em>Toamasina</em> (Tamatave)
</li><li> The city was founded by Europeans but gained a Malagasy name with time. Examples: <em>Antseranana</em> (Diego-Suarez), <em>Tolanaro</em> (Fort-Dauphin) and the small city of <em>Mahavelona</em> (Hopeful Point, then frenchified as Foulpointe)
</li><li> Aversions: the French administration never bothered to translate or change the names of the major cities of <em>Fianarantsoa</em> and <em>Antsirabe</em>, and on the other side the main city on the island of Nosy Be is still <em>Hell-Ville</em> as of now despite a Malagasy name (Andoany) existing.
</li></ul></li><li> Mozambique:
<ul><li> Delagoa Bay -&gt; Lourenço Marques (after a Discoveries-era navigator) -&gt; Maputo (after the river which flows west of the city; originally the Frelimo government thought of Can Phum, after a local pre-colonial chief, but never went through with it)
</li><li> Vila Salazar (after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntonioDeOliveiraSalazar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntonioDeOliveiraSalazar">the Portuguese dictator</a>) -&gt; Matola (after the local Matsolo people)
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>Northern Africa</h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Libya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Libya">Libya</a>:
<ul><li> The capital, Tripoli, was founded as the Phoenician city of Oea. The Phoenicians also founded two other cities nearby Tripoli and together with Oea they were collectively called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">three cities</a>" (<em>tripolis</em>) by the Greeks. Over time, the name was appropriated to refer exclusively to Oea.
</li><li> Benghazi was originally known as "Euesperides/Hesperides" when it was first founded by the Greeks. In the 3rd century BCE, it was changed to "Berenice", honoring the name of a local princess who was given in marriage to king Ptolemy III. It got its present name after it became a major settlement again during the Ottoman period.
</li><li> Bayda was originally "Balagrae" under the Greeks, then "Sidi Rafaa" during the early Islamic period before it finally settled on the current name after the establishment of an influential Sufi order.

<ul><li> Bendigo in Victoria, Australia was officially named Sandhurst in the 19th century. However, all attempts to use "Sandhurst" failed and the government eventually gave up and let it be known as Bendigo.
</li><li> New Hebrides =&gt; Vanuatu
</li><li> Not a city, but the island/state Tasmania in Australia, was named after the first European to see it, Dutchman Abel Tasman. However, Tasman originally named it Anthony van Diemen's Land after his patron and when it was controlled by the British it was shortened to Van Diemen's Land. 200 years after Tasman named it, it was renamed Tasmania after him.
</li><li> German-named places in Australia had their names changed during the war to avoid being associated with 'the enemy'. Some changed back (like Hahndorf, SA, which temporarily became Ambleside), others didn't (Blumburg became Birdwood, SA)
<ul><li> Bismarck became Collinsvale, TAS.
</li><li> The ultimate example: Germanton in New South Wales was renamed Holbrook after Victoria Cross-winning British submarine captain Norman Douglas Holbrook. Despite being 300 kilometres from the nearest coast and having nothing to do with the submariner specifically or nautical things in general. The town is now famous for having the hull of the Cold War era submarine HMAS Otway situated in a park on the main highway.
</li></ul></li><li> Melbourne was originally called Bearbrass, for some reason. Before that, it was Batmania, after its founder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">John Batman</a>.
</li><li> There were a number of places and landmarks given back their Aboriginal names in the 1970s and 1980s, most notably Uluru, formerly Ayers Rock.
</li><li> There's apparently a debate going around in New Zealand about whether to rename Wanganui to Whanganui. Usually this would change the pronunciation in Māori, excepting that the local iwi have their 'wha' the same as 'wa' unlike the rest of Māoridom.
<ul><li> Resolved by using both. Hilariously, this means that the iwi gets the spelling they want at the cost of everyone who doesn't speak the local dialect of Maori now mispronouncing it. For reference, other Te Reo Maori dialects pronounce "wh" as an "f" sound. The correct pronunciation is along the lines of "fa-na-nui"
</li><li> Averted with Mount Egmont/Mount Taranaki - both names are used interchangeably with no one batting an eyelid.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to the Uluru example above, part of many Treaty of Waitangi settlements with Maori iwi in New Zealand involve giving various landmarks an official Māori name in addition to the official English one. One of the most famous examples is Mount Cook, the nation's highest mountain, which is now officially Aoraki/Mount Cook.
</li><li> New Zealand's two main islands went through various names before they became known as the North Island and South Island in the early 20th century. In 2009, the Geographic Board discovered that they weren't even their official names - they had none. They've now been gazetted with dual English and Maori names: North Island / Te Ika-a-Māui and South Island / Te Waipounamu.
</li><li> In Hawaii, Waimea is the name of two towns, one on Kauaʻi, and one on the Big Island. Kamuela is an alternative name (used by the U.S. Postal Service) for the Big Island town to distinguish between the two.
</li><li> East Timor: Vila Salazar (after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntonioDeOliveiraSalazar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AntonioDeOliveiraSalazar">the Portuguese dictator</a>) -&gt; Baucau

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Americas </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Hull/Gatineau, Quebec. As with Pretoria/Tshwane, the old central city is still officially Hull, the metropolitan region (or at least that part of it on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">the Quebec side of the river</a>) once commonly called "Hull", is officially Gatineau.
</li><li> A goodly raft of the towns in Nunavut and in Nunavik (northern Quebec), formerly with English or French names, have had their names changed (or changed <em>back</em>) to Inuktitut names. For example, what used to be Frobisher Bay is now Iqaluit, the capital of Nunavut. (The change was made a number of years before the creation of Nunavut.)
<ul><li> Which amusingly sometimes resulted in the English/French name sounding more native than the translation of the actual native name. An example was the village now known as Kuujjuarapik. It was previously known as "Great Whale River", which sounds very epically native, before the Inuktitut name became official. The word <em>kuujjuarapik</em> means "small big river".
</li></ul></li><li> Nieuw Amsterdam was founded in 1609 on the banks of the Hudson river, in the island of Mannahatta. Later, when the Second Anglo-Dutch War was settled in 1674 by the Treaty of Westminster, the Duke of York from England gained control of New Amsterdam and renamed it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">New York City</a>; Mannahatta was anglicized as Manhattan. Other name changed include Harlem (Haarlem), Flushing (Vlissingen), Brooklyn (Breukelen) and Stuyvesant Town (after the last governor of Nieuw Nederland, Peter Stuyvesant).
<ul><li> Before the Dutch colonized it, the area was known as New Angoulême to Italian explorers.
</li></ul></li><li> In a rare case of changing <em>who</em> a place is named after, but not the actual name of the place, the name of the county in which Seattle, Washington State sits in was changed in 2005 from King County (named after William Rufus King, vice president of the United States at the time of the county's inception), to...um...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenamedTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenamedTheSame">King County</a> (named after Martin Luther King Jr., who visited Seattle in 1961).
<ul><li> This was probably because William Rufus King's most notable political legacy before his 45-day vice presidency was defending slavery in the Senate.
</li><li> Seattle itself was originally named New York-Alki ("New York Someday," in Chinook Jargon)
</li></ul></li><li> Kitchener, Ontario received a new name in 1916 (the middle of World War One), when enough people complained about a Canadian city named "Berlin".
<ul><li> Three years later, what is now Marne, Michigan (outside of Grand Rapids) went through <em>exactly the same thing</em>—everything around there is still called "Berlin (raceway, fairgrounds, etc.)", though.
</li><li> Kitchener was known as (New) Berlin since German American loyalists settled there after the revolution, it wasn't later German immigrants who gave it the name, which was the reasoning for changing it. Kitchener was the head of the British Empire's military at the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FirstWorldWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FirstWorldWar">First World War</a>.

Note that the original name for the area was Toronto and it was renamed to Toronto (a native name) when New York was growing and becoming larger, i.e. they did not want to be a 'second York' in North America. Made funnier ever since Peter Ustinov called the city "New York run by the Swiss." One section of Toronto is still known as "North York"; other sections were formerly known as York and East York before merging with the city. Quite a lot around the city is still named York something-or-other, despite the name change being more than a century ago.
</li><li> There used to be an area in Texas called "Dead Nigger Creek," which was eventually changed to the ever-so-slightly less offensive "Dead Negro Draw."
<ul><li> Similarly, the former "Nigger Bill Canyon" in Utah is now "Negro Bill Canyon". This still embarrasses some local whites, who want as of late 2012 to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNamesake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNamesake">The Namesake</a>'s last name instead, making it Grandstaff Canyon, but the NAACP likes the current name just fine, and is again working to keep it.
</li><li> As of 2015, Quebec is starting to reconsider about a dozen place names <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/quebec-considers-removing-n-word-from-11-place-names-1.3184317">with N-word variants in French and English<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGayNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGayNineties">1890s</a>, the U.S. Postal Service began standardizing spellings by dropping the "h" from town names ending in <em>-burgh</em> (as well as shortening <em>-borough</em> to <em>-boro</em>); this policy relented in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> and many communities have claimed their "h" back. It can take decades for all the signs to change, however.
<ul><li> Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania refused to let go of its "H". Most other Pittsburghs, however, were OK with letting it go, including Pittsburg, Kansas (which is probably why most people realize Pittsburg State University is not in Pennsylvania).
<ul><li> Pittsburg, California was forced to drop the "h" and is actually a double example of this trope; originally it was named "New-York-Of-The-Pacific".
</li><li> See also: Alburgh, Vermont
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Colonies tend to get rid of their master's name on independence (for reasons that have about as much to do with accuracy as with pride).
<ul><li> British Honduras =&gt; Belize
</li><li> British Guiana =&gt; Guyana
</li><li> Dutch Guiana =&gt; Suriname
</li><li> Averted by French Guiana - the official name is "Guyane" but the territory remains part of France.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2noyz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2noyz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2noyz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Guyane has since 1946 been considered not a colony but an "overseas department" of France, meaning that it gets full representation in the French and Europe parliaments; despite being in South America, it's legally part of Europe since it's part of France.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> When Fort William and Port Arthur, Ontario merged, they changed their name. Everyone just called the area "The Lakehead" anyway, so of course they named it "<em>Thunder Bay</em>". You see, there was a vote, and both "Lakehead" and "The Lakehead" were on the ballot next to Thunder Bay. Oops.
<ul><li> More of the same when the city of Galt merged with Preston and Hespeler - resulting in the city of Cambridge, Ontario. Also a bit of a subversion; an early name for the town of Preston was Cambridge Mills.
</li></ul></li><li> In Ontario, the colonial settlements of York, Bytown, Johnstown and Scott's Mills are the thriving cities of Toronto, Ottawa, Cornwall and Peterborough, respectively.
<ul><li> Out West, the settlements of Fort Brisebois, Pile O'Bones, and Fort Camosun are the thriving cities of Calgary, Regina, and Victoria.
<ul><li> The change from Fort Brisebois to Calgary has a somewhat shameful story behind it; Mr Brisebois' commanding officer didn't like that he had taken a Metis woman as a common-law wife.
</li></ul></li><li> And Granville is now Vancouver.
</li><li> And Ville-Marie is now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal">Montreal</a>, and Fort Garry is now Winnipeg (although in both cases there are districts of the city in question with those names).
</li></ul></li><li> There is a city named Buffalo, Texas. When the Dallas Cowboys played the (New York-based) Buffalo Bills in the Super Bowl, the town changed its name to Blue Star for a week to match the Cowboys' logo. When the same cities met for the NHL championship a few years later, they changed the name to Green Star.
<ul><li> There is also a Pittsburg, Texas, which temporarily changed its name to "Cowboys" the last time Dallas and Pittsburgh met in the Super Bowl.
</li></ul></li><li> Orange County, Florida (after which Orange County, California was named, believe it or not), was originally named Mosquito County. It was renamed Orange County when it became the center of the state's citrus industry. And really, who wants to be named after a disease-carrying vermin?
</li><li> In the late 70s, a street in Orange County, Florida, North Nowell Street, was once renamed Lamar Street, for then County Commissioner (and now Florida State's Attorney) Lawson Lamar, for no better reason than Lamar wanted a street named after him. So unpopular was this switch with the locals that they kept knocking over the street signs (in one case, a horde of teenagers descended upon every street sign in the neighborhood with sledgehammers). After replacing the sign for the thirtieth time, the county got the message and restored the street's original name. Lawson Lamar was not amused.
<ul><li> Lamar tried the same trick with a County Park in Orange county a couple of years later, with similar results. Lawson Lamar is generally seen to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> by the people of Orange County, Florida.
</li></ul></li><li> Paterson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewJersey">New Jersey</a> was once a key global producer of silk. At its height it was a major artistic and cultural center; its most famous son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamCarlosWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamCarlosWilliams">William Carlos Williams</a>, wrote his poetry (including his most celebrated work, a poetic portrait of the city, titled <em>Paterson</em>) while practicing pediatrics at the nearby Passaic General Hospital. Two of its largest suburbs incorporated under the names East Paterson and West Paterson in order to identify themselves with Paterson's reputation. Fast forward 90 years: Paterson no longer produces silk, the factories are all broken glass and crumbling facades, and the entire place is considered, fairly or unfairly, a crime-ridden ghetto. Controversially, East &amp; West Paterson became Elmwood Park and Woodland Park to distance themselves from their former namesake. A local joke is that Paterson will rename itself "Park" in revenge.
</li><li> North Beach in Burlington, Vermont was renamed "Bernie Sanders Beach" by the city council for about a day and a half before Sanders himself asked that it <em>not</em> be renamed for him.
</li><li> Many places in Texas use the last names of prominent historical figures, with Houston, Austin and Dallas being the big three examples. After the Civil War, because many of these people were officials or soldiers under the Confederate government, there was pressure from the North to change the namesakes and the fact that some of the place names were after people who sided with the Union and fought against Texas regiments. So while some counties and cities have the same names to reduce confusion as much as possible, their historical meaning can be confused at best and a bitter subject for arguments involving both slavery and a corrupt occupation government at worst. For example, Walker County can claim at least three different namesakes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkerTexasRanger">besides the one we're all familiar with</a>.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> neighborhoods started out as suburbs, and got absorbed. Most of the street names were retained in the process. At the time this happened to Bucktown in the 1800s, it was a German enclave, so the streets had German names: Berlin, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Rhine, and so on. Then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> happened. Most would (eventually) get changed to the names of English authors.
</li><li> The settlement of Frenchtown, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan">Michigan</a> Territory, was incorporated as the Village of Monroe, and the newly-formed surrounding county named Monroe County, following President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JamesMonroe">James Monroe</a>'s visit to the territory in 1817. The Frenchtown name remains an important part of the region, however, due to the Battle of Frenchtown in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOf1812">War of 1812</a>, and the township north of the present City of Monroe is named Frenchtown.
</li><li> Also in Michigan: in 1829, Bucklin Township split in half to become Nankin (west) and Pekin (east) Townships. Nankin further split into Livonia (north) and Nankin (south) Townships, while Pekin was split into Redford (north) and Dearborn (south) Townships. Livonia incorporated as a city in 1950, while Redford saw most of its area annexed by Detroit in the 1920s.
<ul><li> Changing borders and mergers resulted in the present-day City of Dearborn being made up of parts of Bucklin/Redford/Dearborn/Bucklin/Dearborn Township, the Village of Dearbornville, parts of Springwells/Greenfield Township (the ones that didn't become Southwest Detroit), and the Village of Springwells/Fordson, while parts of Dearborn Township were annexed by Detroit, another part by Inkster, and the remainder of the township that didn't join the City of Dearborn becoming Dearborn Heights.
</li><li> Nankin split off the cities of Wayne, Garden City, and the west half of Inkster, and still had a burgeoning population of 70,000 (the most populous township in the world at the time) before incorporating as the City of Westland in 1966... all so they could keep Livonia from annexing the northern half of Nankin, which contained the newly-opened Westland Mall. Yes, that's right, <em>the city named itself after its mall</em>. The Nankin name lives on, though, with place names within the city.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Michigan example: in 1837, two brothers settled on the south bank of the Grand River a little downstream of its confluence with the Red Cedar, and called it "Biddle City". They then went back to their home area in Upstate New York, where they sold some of their old neighbors on the settlement by convincing them that it was a real town, with a church and post office and everything. When a surprising number of these New Yorkers showed up and found nothing of the kind, they still stuck it out and named their little settlement "Lansing" after their New York home; the township in which Lansing was situated became known as Lansing Township. A few years later, the state government decided that Lansing Township was a good place to move—scared by the possibility of British attack on Detroit, which was (and is) right across from Canada—and began preparations to move to a new settlement nearby, which was called the "Town of Michigan". However, as Lansing and Michigan grew closer together, the former absorbed the latter, and thus by the mid-1850s they were treated as one unit. In 1859, the City of Lansing was finally incorporated, picking a permanent name for the area that had been capital for nearly ten years.
</li><li> Atlanta, Georgia started off as Terminus and then became Marthasville before becoming Atlanta.
</li><li> Sort of happened to Guadalajara, Mexico, which was founded <em>four</em> times: the first became a small town called Nochistlán, the second became a neighborhood called Tonalá, the third became another small town called Tlacopán, and the fourth became Guadalajara itself. (And for the record, it's named after the small 80,000-people city of Guadalajara, Spain, and Guadalajara, Mexico is home to almost 5,000,000 people).
</li><li> Clark, Texas, became DISH, Texas, because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">DISH Network</a> offered the inhabitants free satellite TV for 10 years.
</li><li> In the same vein, the town of Halfway, Oregon temporarily renamed itself "Half.Com" , as a marketing stunt for a website of that name, at the height of the dot-com boom. All parties involved seem to have quietly let the whole affair be forgotten.
</li><li> The town of Hot Springs, New Mexico, was renamed "Truth or Consequences" after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TruthOrConsequences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TruthOrConsequences">the quiz show</a>, because the show's host promised to air the show out of the first city to do this. It is commonly referred to as "T or C" to save some effort.
</li><li> The city of Topeka, Kansas changed its name to Google, Kansas for the month of March 2010, to try and motivate Google to bring its fiber-optic network experiment to the city. This was not a legal name change, but rather simply a marketing one, as the city's lawyers advised against making the name change legal.
<ul><li> In return, <a class="urllink" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html">Google changed their name to Topeka<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFoolsDay">April Fools' Day</a>.
</li><li> Admittedly, Topeka has a history of this - on the day Pokemon debuted in the US, it changed its name to Topikachu. Two decades later, Topeka changed its name to Topikachu again to celebrate the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonLetsGoPikachuAndLetsGoEevee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonLetsGoPikachuAndLetsGoEevee">Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the case of the capital of North Dakota, which remained Bismarck throughout two wars with Germany.
<ul><li> Also played completely straight with the capital of North Dakota; it was originally named Edwinton and changed to Bismarck in 1873 to appeal to a new wave of German immigrants.
</li></ul></li><li> St. Paul, Minnesota was originally called Pig's Eye by locals after the tavern of the same name.
</li><li> In 1874, Rancho San Pascual, California changed its name to Indiana Colony... or possibly Orange Grove. There was a post office for each name, and mail sent to either would arrive in the same place, not to mention the neighboring town of Lake Vineyard. Soon, the city became sufficiently large as to need a single name, so they started using a new one: Pasadena.
</li><li> The towns of Westminster and Artesia, California are never referred to by their actual names; rather they are "Little Saigon" and "Little India" respectively. There are actual government documents that recognize these names, but the municipalities retain their old titles.
<ul><li> There are lots of these kinds of Official Name v. Colloquial Name situations in Southern California. In another example, the towns of Canyon Country, Newhall, Saugus and Valencia incorporated together in 1987 as the city of Santa Clarita, but residents and businesses still use the old names.
</li><li> This is an exaggeration, unfortunately. Plenty, if not most, people in southern California call Artesia and Westminster by their actual names and the "Little Saigon" or "Little India" sobriquets are by no means the dominant names.
</li></ul></li><li> The area that would become San Diego was first named "San Miguel" by Spanish explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo when he landed there in 1542. When Sebastián Vizcaíno landed there sixty years later in 1602, unaware that the land had <em>already</em> been named and claimed for the Spanish Empire, he named it "San Diego" after his flagship, and the name stuck.
</li><li> In Oregon, Dead Indian Road was renamed Dead Indian <em>Memorial</em> Road.
</li><li> The Oregon state government has also mandated that all geographical names (roads, streams, mountains, etc.) within the state that include the word "squaw" be renamed.
</li><li> Speaking of Oregon, "Oregon" was originally one of two names for a stretch of land between the Pacific Ocean and the Continental Divide that was the subject of a border dispute between the U.S. and the British from the 1830s to 1846, extending from the northern border of California at the 42nd parallel north to the southern border of Russian Alaska a little bit north of the 54th parallel north. The issue was that the agreed border between the U.S. and British Canada (the 49th parallel north) only went as far as the Rocky Mountains, and so the border west of the mountains remained a point of contention. In general, the Americans called the area "Oregon," while the British called the area the "Columbia District" (after the Columbia River). When the U.S. and Britain agreed in 1846 to resolve the territorial dispute by extending the border east of the Rockies west to the Pacific (except for Vancouver Island, which was to be entirely British), the British kept the "Columbia" name for their half (which later joined Canada as, obviously, "British Columbia"), and the US kept the "Oregon" name. When the Americans split their part in half again, the southern part kept the name "Oregon", and the northern part was planned to be named "Columbia", until a rather last-minute change named it "Washington" instead...out of a desire to avoid confusion with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">District of Columbia</a>. Clearly, someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">Didn't Think This Through</a>.
<ul><li> Oregon and Washington are still divided by the Columbia River, as a result.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly to the Oregon example above, Squaw Peak in Arizona was renamed Piestewa Peak, in honor of Army Spc. Lori Ann Piestewa, the first known Native American woman to die in combat in the U.S. military, and first female soldier to be killed in action in the 2003 Iraq War.
</li><li> The city of Longmont, Colorado once had a street named Chivington Drive, named for the hero of the battle of La Glorieta Pass (1862) in the Civil War. Unfortunately, Col. John Chivington also happened to be the man responsible for the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864; the name was changed to Sunrise Drive in 2004.
</li><li> The city of Auburn, Washington was originally incorporated in 1891 under the name Slaughter. The community had been known by that name since 1884, named after Lieutenant William Slaughter, who was killed in a skirmish in 1855 while leading a military unit in the area. The town name was changed by petition to the legislature in 1893, due to its negative connotations. Apparently train passengers did not like hearing that the next stop would be at Slaughter House (the largest local hotel at the time). The origins of the new name are disputed.
<ul><li> A fact made more amusing when you consider that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Green River</a> runs through town, which Gary Ridgway (who lived variously between Auburn and the city of Kent on the river's other bank) made famous.
</li></ul></li><li> The town of New Berlin, Wisconsin didn't change its name due to Anti-German sentiment from the two world wars, but they did change how it was <em>pronounced</em>. Instead of calling it New Ber-LIN, with the accent on the last syllable, the emphasis was shifted to the middle, resulting in New BER-lin. Saying it the "correct" German way to a local will usually get you asked where you're from.
<ul><li> Moscow, Idaho, is MAHS-Coh, not -Cow like its Russian namesake—very probably since its founding, not a change. See also Paris, Texas, unlikely to be pronounced Pah-REE, and Versailles, Kentucky, pronouced "Ver-SALES" by the locals.
</li></ul></li><li> San Angelo, Texas, was originally named Santa Ángela in honor of the founder's wife. A few years later it became San Angela, only because that was easier to say. In 1883, the US Postal Service pointed out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">the name was grammatically incorrect</a> and insisted on the present name as a condition for opening a post office there.
<ul><li> However ... the proper masculine form of said name in Spanish is "Ángel" - "Angelo" is Italian.
</li></ul></li><li> Three cities and towns within Emanuel County, Georgia were renamed at various points in time:
<ul><li> The county seat, Swainsboro, was renamed Paris upon its incorporation in 1854; however, the city reverted back to its original name 3 years later.
</li><li> The town of Twin City is so named because it is a consolidation of two smaller communities: Graymont and Summit.
</li><li> The town of Stillmore allegedly got its name due to its residents having a sense of humor. The town was originally named Kea's Mill; however, the U.S. Postal Service did not approve of the name and sent a memo with suggested town names. The memo advised them that if they did not like any of the names on the list, "still more" could be sent.
</li></ul></li><li> A guy named Thomas Bicknell offered to donate a free library with 1,000 books to any town that would rename itself after him. In 1914, two small Utah towns expressed interest. He decided to give each town 500 books. Thurber became Bicknell and Grayson became Blanding (Bicknell's wife's maiden name).
<ul><li> Speaking of Utah, another "cities merge and select an entirely new name" incident: the Salt Lake City suburbs of Granger, Hunter, Chesterfield and Redwood joined together and incorporated in 1980, but decided to adopt the vague and slightly awkward name West Valley City. It's now Utah's second-largest city. Granger and Hunter still survive as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Names</a>, even for institutions built after the merger.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>pueblo</em> (village) that would become the city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SanFrancisco">San Francisco</a> was originally named Yerba Buena, after a local medicinal plant. When the United States took it over in 1846, it was renamed after the nearby (and much better known) Mission San Francisco de Asis (Mission of St. Francis of Assisi).
</li><li> Brazil has a lot of this, most of them are new grammar change (Corytiba to Curitiba) or to keep the name shorter (São Paulo de Piratininga to simply São Paulo)
</li><li> Speaking of Brazil, Florianópolis has a long story about name change. It was founded as "Ilha de Santa Catarina" and turned to "Nossa Senhora do Desterro" or only Desterro. In 1894 the city name was changed as an homage to the current president Floriano Peixoto. Problem is he wasn't very popular in Desterro, you can imagine how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">people react to it.</a> But nowadays people just casually say "Floripa" because Florianóplis is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">too long.</a>
</li><li> Winston and Salem were once two separate cities in North Carolina. Salem came first, founded by the Moravian Church in 1753. Not wishing to be the seat of Forsyth County due to their religious isolationism at the time, the church sold land to the county to found Winston in 1849. All was well, until R. J. Reynolds and Pleasent Hanes' tobacco factories <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3y7rc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3y7rc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3y7rc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Hanes later sold his tobacco business to Reynolds and began his far more famous second career in textiles.</span> took off and made the city rich, causing it to grow rapidly and threaten to swallow up the more modest Salem. Salem protested that they were there first, beginning a contentious relationship between the two cities as to which was more important. The post office helped put an end to the issue by constantly referring to the area as "Winston-Salem" and naming the main post office as such in 1899. By 1913, both cities realized they were pretty much stuck with each other, and they formally became the single entity of Winston-Salem.
</li><li> The zinc mining town of Palmerton, Pennsylvania was known by the decidedly less normal name of Horse Head for some years after its foundation, after Horse Head Industries, the mining company that mined the aforementioned zinc. Allegedly, owner John Palmer didn't like the idea of the town being named after himself. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">After he died, "Palmerton", long an unofficial name, became the official one anyway</a>.

<h3>General</h3>
<ul><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">The Great Politics Mess-Up</a>, many street names were changed. There used to be a Lenin street and a Stalin street in every village before, which usually got renamed to a national historical figure.
</li><li> Just about everywhere in western Poland (formerly eastern Germany, until the end of WWII), Kaliningrad Oblast (formerly northern East Prussia), and western Ukraine and Belarus (formerly eastern Poland) have had at least one nameswap in English.
<ul><li> This is less a case of actual renaming and more a convention of which names are used in English. Preferred names in English tend to follow the language of the ruling power in the region (since they're all foreign to English speakers anyway), but in the languages themselves, the name may persist. For example, even though the Polish name for Warsaw is "Warszawa", English speakers call it Warsaw, German speakers call it Warschau et cetera. London is called "Londres" in French and Spanish.
</li><li> Actually in many cases it is what is easier to pronounce, for instance for a long time the West German city of Aachen was called Aix-la-Chapelle and Köln still is called Cologne in English, even though the only time these cities belonged to France was from 1796 to 1814, i. e. when Britain was at war with France (to complicate the issue further, said cities are known in Spanish as, respectively, Aquisgrán and Colonia; in both cases, these modern names derive from independent evolution of the original Latin names: "Aquis-granum" and "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium"; this happens in other languages as well: "Aquisgrana" in Italian, "Akwizgran" in Polish, etc.). München and Venezia, which never were part of France, are also called by their French names Munich and Venice (Venise) in English. And there is the Tuscan port of Livorno which for some reason is called "Leghorn" in English.
</li><li> The name "Leghorn" derives from occasional unconventional English pronunciation of "gh" as "f" (as in "laugh"). "Leghorn" was originally pronounced like "Leforn" in English, not too differently from the original.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nazis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirstripOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirstripOne">renamed a few places in occupied parts of Eastern and Eastern Central Europe</a>, sometimes so they would sound German, sometimes as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Egopolis</a>, e.g. Lodz became Litzmannstadt, named after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarOne">World War One</a> general and early supporter of Hitler, and Gdynia was assigned the pseudo-Teutonic name Gotenhafen. Some insensitive (West) German officials long insisted that people from such places filled in these names in forms because that was their <em>official</em> name at the time of the birth etc. of the person concerned.
<ul><li> Conversely, former-German-now-Polish (since 1945) towns and villages for the most part received names that were Polish forms or translations of the German ones (which had often existed earlier, partly due to the fact that many of these places had been Polish or Slavic before they became German).

<ul><li> Many settlements in Russia and the Soviet Union have been renamed, from villages to major cities. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_renamed_cities_and_towns_in_Russia">A list of ones in Russia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCityFormerlyKnownAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCityFormerlyKnownAs">St. Petersburg</a> became Petrograd when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> began (the government thought the name sounded too German, even though it was actually from Dutch owing to Peter the Great's peculiar fondness for the Netherlands), then Leningrad with the rise of the Soviet Union, and reverted to St. Petersburg shortly before its collapse. The surrounding oblast (province) is still called "Leningradskaja", however, and the city still has a major square named after Lenin.
</li><li> "Königsberg" (meaning "King's mountain") became "Kaliningrad", i.e. "Kalinin City", named after the Soviet Head of State Mikhail Kalinin, when the Soviets took it from Germany. Many of the locals prefer "Kyonig". Like with most former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand">Commie Land</a> renamings, there is a movement in favor of renaming it back (or rather, to the Russian transliteration "Kyonigsberg", as nearly 90% of the Kaliningrad Oblast's population is Russian and less than 1% are German).
<ul><li> In the future history of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TranshumanSpace">Transhuman Space</a></em>, the Kaliningrad oblast gains independence - the country so formed is named Königsberg, but the city remains Kaliningrad.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Kaliningrad oblast, i.e. the part of East Prussia that became part of the Russian Federation (then the RSFSR) in 1945, all towns and villages were given entirely new Russian names, even if the original name of the place was of Baltic (Old Prussian or Lithuanian) or West Slavic (i.e. Polish and closely related languages) not German origin (e. g. Tilsit became Sovietsk), not just to match Soviet sensibilities, but also to please Russian patriotism, e. g. by naming them after Tsarist Generals like Kutuzov and Bagration (the latter however was Georgian, like Stalin) and to show the Lithuanians who was the boss. Today there is a Russian law to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">prevent the post-1945 names from being changed</a>.
<ul><li> Shortly before the Russians and Poles took over, the Nazis renamed several hundreds of villages in East Prussia and Upper Silesia because their names sounded too Slavic (Mazuric or Polish) or Lithuanian.
</li></ul></li><li> Nizhnyj Novgorod became Gorkij in 1929 (after the novelist), then reverted to the older name and the oblast actually changed name with it. Curiously enough, the auto-maker GAZ (from <em>Gorkij Avtomobilnyj Zavod</em>, "Gorkij automobile factory") was founded in 1922 as NNAZ, and was obviously renamed with the city, but has not reverted to the original name; the likely reason is that GAZ has developed a brand around the <em>Gaz</em>elle.
</li><li> Similarly, Tsaritsyn became Stalingrad and after de-Stalinization in 1961 became Volgograd, though there is a civic movement to restore the Stalingrad name. This has nothing to do with a liking of Stalin and everything to do with the WWII battle fought there, which the citizens are quite proud of.
</li><li> Yekaterinburg was known as Sverdlovsk between 1924 and 1991, the oblast retaining that name, which 80s show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Airwolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Airwolf">Airwolf</a></em> uses.
</li><li> Tsarskoye Selo ("Village of the Tsar") became and remains "Pushkin", after the great Russian poet, who went to school at the local lyceum.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Ukraine</h3>
<ul><li> The main city of western Ukraine: Lemberg (the German form, official under Austria-Hungary)-&gt; Lwów (the Polish form, official when it was part of Poland) -&gt; Львов (L'vov, the Russian form, official under the Soviet Union) or Львів (L'viv, the Ukrainian form, official today) within less than ninety years. And then there was the pre-Austrian official Latin form Leopolis.
</li><li> The spelling of the capital of Ukraine, Kiev (Russian: Киев) or Kyiv (Ukrainian: Київ), is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame War</a> issue. It was long almost universally romanized as as Kiev, which offends Ukrainian nationalists who don't want their capital city to have a "foreign" name and insist that Kyiv be used. The Ukrainian government has also requested that this be done, and Western governments and newspapers are increasingly calling the city Kyiv. Russian nationalists (and Ukraine's Russian-speaking minority) on the other hand argue that the world has known the city as Kiev for so long that there's no reason to stop using that name. The fact that Kiev/Kyiv was the capital of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KievanRus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KievanRus">the ancient kingdom that both Russia and Ukraine claim to be the modern successor to</a> adds fuel to the dispute, as does the perception among Ukrainians that Russia wants to conquer them (again).
<ul><li> Before independence, Ukraine usually was referred to "the Ukraine" in English, but now this is considered non-standard. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCrossReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalCrossReference">This is apparently based on a dispute in Russian and Ukrainian over which preposition should be used</a> - Slavic languages have two words that both roughly translate to "in" but have subtly different meanings, and for historical reasons Ukraine tends to be referred to by the one that usually connotes a region within a country rather than a country in its own right — even though the use or non-use of "the" with the name of a country or region in English does not actually show a clear-cut correlation: the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, the Philippines and the Maldives are independent nations, as was the Soviet Union, while e. g. Siberia, Normandy, New England, Kansas, Glamorgan, Wessex, Saxony and Queensland are not.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>Poland</h3>
<ul><li> Breslau -&gt; Wroclaw
</li><li> Danzig -&gt; Gdańsk. This name change has notoriously caused flame wars on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> - <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Gdansk">the talk page contains eleven archives and still had the argument going on,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but usage was finally settled by vote, varying by who controlled the city in several historical periods, and using one or the other name first but including the other for biographies.
</li><li> Stettin -&gt; Szczecin
</li><li> In the fifties Katowice was renamed Stalinogrod after Stalin... which spawned numerous jokes since "Kat" is Polish for an executioner/torturer/murderer. This may have been why the name change didn't stick - whether the Communist official who proposed the name change <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">did so in order to facilitate these jokes</a> is unknown. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4bo4f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4bo4f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4bo4f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There's an anecdote Częstochowa was first nominated for the name change, but it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyCity">Holy City</a> in Poland, and somebody came to a conclusion "Our Lady of Stalin's City" sounds just too stupid.</span> To add to the confusion, in Imperial Germany times, it was also known as Kattowitz.
<ul><li> And on the subject of Imperial Germany, several cities in former Eastern Germany reverted to their Polish names (or got new ones; some of the cities never had a Polish name previously on account of being founded <em>after</em> the region was under German rule) in 1918 when Poland regained its independence.
</li></ul></li><li> Oświęcim held that name for most of the history, being in the middle bit of Poland which Stalin and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">his predecessors</a> only ethnically cleansed a little. Its name in German is far more infamous - Auschwitz.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Czechoslovakia / Czech Republic</h3>
<ul><li> After becoming part of Czechoslovakia following Austria-Hungary's dissolution, the city of Pozsony/Pressburg/Preszporok became the more Slavic-sounding Bratislava. Slavic names were given to many other cities in formerly Hungarian territories that became parts of Slovakia and Romania.
<ul><li> It should be noted though that there had been Slavic (specifically Slovak) names for the city before; the German name Pressburg is in fact derived from the name of a Slavic ruler. With the other places it generally was a case of the Slovak or Romanian name coming to the fore among the alternatives (Romanian by the way is not a Slavic, but a Romance language). In Transylvania these days they tend to be very proud that the towns there have three names - one Romanian, one German, and one Hungarian.
</li></ul></li><li> Karlovy Vary, also in the Czech Republic, was once Karlsbad under German rule and remained known by that title in English through the Second World War, after which its German population was expelled.
</li><li> In Czechoslovakia a politically motivated name change also took place: following the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia, the town of Zlín (best known as the place where Tomá Baťa founded his shoe factory) was renamed to Gottwaldov (after the first communist - or, using terminology of the day, "worker" - president of Czechoslovakia). It was changed back immediately after the Velvet Revolution.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Bulgaria</h3>
<ul><li> A number of ancient towns and cities changed names over the centuries. Most of these are various transcriptions of the same original name depending on who held the city at the time. Some were renamed after ambitious rulers or geographical features and others (most later reverted) for ideological purposes when the country became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand">Commie Land</a>:
</li><li> Sofia was named Serdica after the Thracian tribe which found it, which evolved into the Slavic Sredetz (also "center"). Later it came to be called Sofia after its patron saint.
</li><li> Plovdiv was founded by Thracians as Eumolpia, was renamed by Philip II of Macedon as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Philipopolis</a>, then by the Thracians after they retook the city to Pulpudeva (a translation of the Greek name), then by Romans to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Descriptiveville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Descriptiveville">Trimontium</a>, and had variations of those names (Puldin, Pluvdiv, Philipi, Filibe) during the centuries.
</li><li> Varna was originally named Odessos, also briefly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Tiberopolis</a> during the reign of Roman emperor Tiberius, then to Varna in the middle ages, presumably under Slavic influence. When the country was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommieLand">Commie Land</a>, it was briefly renamed to Stalin.
</li><li> Blagoevgrad was renamed so after Dimitar Blagoev, an early socialist activist, from its old name of Gorna Djumaya, which was partly Turkish and thus politically unsuitable.
</li><li> Shumen was temporarily renamed to Kolarovgrad after the death of communist head of state Vasil Kolarov, who was born there.
</li><li> Montana started out as Montanesium in Roman times, was named Kutlovitsa by Slavs, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Ferdinand</a> after the new prince, then Mihailovgrad in memory of communist revolutionary Hristo Mihailov. The current name is supposedly based on the ancient Roman town.
</li><li> Numerous towns and villages were renamed after the countr's liberation to negate Turkish influence, and after the communist coup to remove any association with the royalist regime.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Other Eastern European countries</h3>
<ul><li> Hungary had its share of Soviet city names with Leninváros (Lenin City, later renamed to Tiszaújváros) and Sztálinváros (Stalin City, later renamed to Dunaújváros).
</li><li> The capital of Montenegro, Podgorica, was known as Titograd in the days of Communism.
<ul><li> Many, many other examples. Due to his cult-like status, everything had "Tito's" (Titovo) as an adjective in Montenegro and Serbia. Titovo Uzice? Uzice. Titograd is just a shorter version of "Tito's city". Now, almost all of the names are Tito-free.
</li></ul></li><li> In Latvia, city of Daugavpils. Although most of its names were simply translations of the original - Dünaburg (Town on Düna, which is German name for Daugava River), who built a castle in 13th century, around which the town formed, then in 17th it became a part of Russian Empire as Borisoglebsk, only to be taken by Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and renamed back to Dinaburg... To be given to Russian Empire after partition of said Commonwealth, who renamed the city to Dvinsk ((Town) on Dvina, Dvina is Russian name for Daugava river) in 19th century. After WWI and Russain Revolution Latvia finally became independent, and renamed the city Daugavpils (Town on Daugava). Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WW2">WW2</a> and Soviets' annexation came, so Soviets... Surprisingly, left the city with its Latvian name.
</li><li> In Lithuania, city of Marijampolė was called "Paeupys" in early days, before being changed to "Starapolė" when the village was granted city rights, before being changed to "Marijampolė". However, at a later point the Soviets renamed Marijampolė to "Kapsukas" after Vincas Kapsukas, a local governor, and after the Soviet reign the name was changed back to "Marijampolė".
</li><li> An older example from Finland: The city of Vaasa burned down in 1852. Emperor Nicholas I <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">donated a large sum of money for its rebuilding</a>, and after his death, Vaasa was renamed to Nikolainkaupunki ("Nicholas's City") in his honour (a first attempt was made <em>before</em> his death, but he disapproved). Later during the reign of Nicholas II (whom everybody hated) the new name lost popularity, and it was changed back after he abdicated in 1917.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IstanbulNotConstantinople">Constantinople changed to Istanbul</a>.
<ul><li> Originally it was a small Greek colony called Byzantion. The Roman emperor Constantinus decided to move the capital of the empire from Rome to there, in the process renaming it Nova Roma ("New Rome" in Latin, the official language of the Empire). Everybody just called it Konstantinoupolis ("Constantine's City" in Greek, the language people actually spoke in the eastern part of the Empire), though, and the name stayed mostly the same (only changing to Turkish Kostantiniyye) until 1933, when it was changed to the popular title of İstanbul. The name İstanbul probably derives from a corruption of Greek 'eis tēn Polin' ('to the city' or 'in the city').
</li></ul></li><li> The capital of Estonia is Tallinn. It was called Reval before Estonian independence in 1918 - and it was reverted back to Reval when the Nazis invaded in 1941. It was re-renamed Tallinn when the Soviets regained Estonia in 1944.
</li><li> After the Soviets took charge of Armenia many city names were changed. The names were changed back once Armenia gained independence. The the most obvious example however is Gyumri, Armenia's second-largest city. It's name was changed from Gyumri to Alexandropol under Tsarist Russian rule in 1837, then to Leninakan in 1924 under Soviet rule, only to revert back to Gyumri in 1991 with Armenia's independence. There is also Vanadzor, which was originally named Karakilisa (a Turkic name meaning "black church" from when the Seljuks invaded the area), then Kirovakan under Soviet rule, and finally gaining its current Armenian-rooted name meaning "Van valley" after independence.

<p></p><h3>United Kingdom</h3>
<ul><li> In England most cities that weren't created during the Industrial Revolution have a string of names from successive waves of invaders. York was originally the Roman city of Eboracum, but when the Anglo-Saxons created the Kingdom of Northumbria they called it Eoforwic. Then the Vikings invaded and Eoforwic got Scandinavianised into Jórvik, and finally mutated into York around the 13th century.
</li><li> In Wales, all places are given names in both English and Welsh. Since Wales has been invaded about as often as England, usually by the same people, names in both languages are often a weird mishmash of translations, transliterations, and renamings, and which is more accurate or original can be hard to tell. For example, Cardiff (the capital) appears to be an obvious corrupted transliteration of Caerdydd, meaning Castle of the Day. However, Caerdydd is itself a corruption (probably driven by people who thought Castle of the Day was a cool name) of the earlier Caerdyf (itself derived from an earlier Celtic name meaning "Castle on the Taff", but not technically meaning anything in Welsh), which would actually be closer to the modern English pronunciation.
<ul><li> Other places have entirely disconnected names. Swansea was originally established as a Viking trading post, and is most likely named after the Norse king Sweyn Forkbeard (other etymologies are argued, but all come from Old Norse). The Welsh name, Abertawe, simply means "Mouth of the River Tawe". Both names have been used concurrently for about as long as the city has existed.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly to Ireland, many place names in Scotland are Anglifications of Gaelic names such as Inbhir Nis (Inverness, "Mouth of the Ness") Obar Dheathain (Aberdeen, "Mouth of Two Rivers") and Dùn Dèagh (Dundee, "Fort of the Tay"). Edinburgh, contrary to popular belief, is not originally a Germanic or Gaelic toponym - being firstly the Brythonic "Din Eidyn" (Fort of Eidyn), which was transliterated as the Gaelic "Dùn Èideann" and only later became known by the Anglo-Saxon name "Edinburgh".
</li><li> This also applies to streets. One particular example from Havering, a borough of London - a street had its name changed after the councillor it was named after was convicted for paedophilia.
<ul><li> Penny Lane in Liverpool was named after a 18th-century slave trader of that name, not the coin. The fact that the area was sung about by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> is likely the only thing causing the name to be kept.
</li><li> There is only one Anita Street in Britain. It's in Manchester. When it was first built in the 19th century, it was called Sanitary Street, as the first street in the city where every house was equipped with an indoor flush toilet. The residents didn't like the advertising inherent in the original name, and petitioned for it to be changed.
</li><li> Streets at the western end of Strand in London were named by the 18th-century landowner who built them so as to spell out his full name and title: George Villiers Duke of Buckingham (George Street now lies underneath Charing Cross Station). Westminster City Council, having no sense of whimsy, renamed Of Alley to York Place sometime in the 1960s.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>Ireland</h3>
<ul><li> Most place names in Ireland are anglicisations of the original Irish names (e.g. Dublin = <em>Dubh Linn</em> or 'Black Pool').<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5y74s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5y74s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5y74s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Oddly, for more or less the same reason as Blackpool in Lancashire, just across the Irish Sea—a local body of water was discoloured by a nearby bog.</span> Although still referred to by their English names, towns and villages today have signs at the entrances that give both the Irish and English placenames.
</li><li> Around the time of the formation of the Irish Free State, Kingstown and Queenstown were renamed Dún Laoghaire and Cobh. King's County and Queen's County were renamed County Offaly and County Laoghis (pronounced "leash" and later shortened to "County Laois").
<ul><li> What is now Dún Laoghaire had actually already been anglicised to 'Dunleary' when its name was changed to 'Kingstown' in 1821.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, Philipstown became Daingean, Maryborough to Portlaoise.
<ul><li> Other placenames only partially caught on, meaning that either name is used — Bagenalstown/Muine Bheag, Charleville/Ráth Luirc. And no-one beyond cartographers and government offices call Newbridge "Droichead Nua."
</li></ul></li><li> This can lead to some somewhat strange circumstances where the English name is an anglicisation of an Irish one—but the Irish name is something completely different (e.g. the aforementioned Dublin—its Irish name is Baile Átha Cliath, meaning "Town of the Hurdled Ford" on account of an old fording place on the Liffey near what is now Father Matthew Bridge).
</li><li> Ireland is one of the few countries in Europe to have captions on the license plates. This was done because when the current numbering system was introduced, it included a one or two-letter county code, and people complained because these were abbreviations of the <em>English</em> county names.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6yly0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6yly0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6yly0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which made sense given that only about 10% of the Irish people actually speak Gaelic, and the vast majority speak English.</span> The solution? Keep them in the number itself, with the Gaelic county name spelled out in full across the top of the plate.
</li><li> One city in Ireland has been recorded in the annals of history as Daire Calgaigh, Daire Coluimb Coille, Doire (its current name in the Irish language), Derrie and eventually Londonderry. The city council brought a case to the High Court in 2006 that the city's legal name should be changed to Derry - the council legally changed its name from Londonderry City Council to Derry City Council in 1984 - but were ruled against by the presiding judge because the city's Royal Charter was drawn up in 1662 under then name Londonderry. Most locals use "The Maiden City" or "Stroke City" (popularised by another native of the city, radio broadcaster Gerry Anderson, whose show is broadcast from the place and is referred to on-air as "Derry stroke Londonderry") to avoid alienating the other side of the political divide - but, to be honest, nearly everyone, Catholic, Protestant, atheist or Jedi, still calls it Derry. The local BBC service is "Radio Foyle" after the river.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>Germany</h3>
<ul><li> Wolfsburg, Germany was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">originally officially</a> named <em>Stadt des KdF-Wagens</em> ("City of the Strength-through-Joy Car"); most non-officials of the era just called it <em>die Autostadt</em>, which became the name of a large auto museum downtown. Also, in 2003 it was temporarily renamed "Golfsburg" (after the car not the game, just in case you hadn't guessed...)
<ul><li> However, that "Golfsburg" thing wasn't an official name change, just a marketing stunt.
</li></ul></li><li> In a similar move to revolutionary France, the German Democratic Republic, which until 1952 consisted of five <em>Länder</em> (Mecklenburg, Brandenburg, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt and Thuringia), was redivided into 14 districts (<em>Bezirke</em>) named after the seat of its administration (from Rostock in the north to Suhl in the south). In this reorganisation it was made sure that the borders between two districts never coincided with an old border between two <em>Länder</em>.
<ul><li> Chemnitz, Germany was called Karl-Marx-Stadt from 1952 to 1990. No prizes for guessing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany">what part of Germany it's in</a>.
</li><li> Similar, Stalinstadt, founded in 1950, renamed in 1961 to Eisenhüttenstadt (City of the Ironworks).
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>Austria</h3>
<ul><li> The town of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucking%2C_Austria">Fucking<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had been contemplating a name change, at least in part because Anglophone tourists keep stealing the town sign. The residents refused a name change though, and so they decided to just have theft-resistant town signs.
<ul><li> They also make a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/german-beer-can-call-itself-fking-hell">light beer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The country itself was briefly renamed "Ostmark" after the <em>Anschluss</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirstripOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirstripOne">to erase its national identity</a>. It didn't last long.
</li></ul><p></p><h3>France</h3>
<ul><li> Up until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> France consisted of a number of historic provinces (such as Brittany, the Champagne, Lorraine, the Touraine etc.) which had their own laws, traditions, regional identities etc. The Revolution abolished this diversity in favour of national laws, systems of weights and measures etc. and in general tried to promote a sense of national identity over the old provincial ones. As part of this effort the old provinces were broken up into smaller administrative districts, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DepartementalIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DepartementalIssues">départements</a></em>, whose names were taken from geographical features rather than the historic names of the regions, e. g. Seine, Vosges, Bas-Rhin, Vendée, Morbihan, and Marne.
</li><li> In France, the geometrically-shaped city of La Roche-sur-Yon became known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Napoléon</a> upon being made capital of Vendée prefecture on imperial decree in 1804. Upon the Bourbon Restauration it was renamed to Bourbon-Vendée, then back to Napoléon during the Hundred Days, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">then back to Bourbon-Vendée after Napoleon's defeat, then back to Napoléon during the Second Republic</a> under President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, who after becoming Emperor Napoleon III, ended up going with Napoléon<em>-Vendée</em>. Until 1870 where the Third Republic eventually renamed the city La Roche-sur-Yon.
</li><li> Further north, the city/province of Gwenedd, in southern Brittany, named after Gwynedd in Wales, eventually became the more Romance-sounding Vannes. Similarly, the old province of Kernev became Cornouaille, although unhelpfully it's named after Kernow (Cornwall), which is known as Cornouailles (note the final "s") in French. Similarly to the Guadalajara example, a number of older place-names in Brittany date back to the Brythonic settlers from Wales and Cornwall who just renamed their new settlements on the continent after existing settlements and traditional saints on the mainland.
<ul><li> In fact, Brittany <em>itself</em> has the same issue, as the French language uses the same words for Brittany as for Roman Britain (Bretagne), while Great Britain is rendered as Grande Bretagne; the <em>Breton</em> language does the same by calling the continental peninsula Breizh and the island Breizh-Veur ("veur" means "great").

<ul><li> Benevento, Italy was long ago called (roughly) "Maloenton" by the Oscan-speaking Samnites who inhabited it, meaning probably 'fruit market' in Oscan. To the Romans who conquered them, however, it sounded an awful lot like "Maleventum", a place of "bad events". So they changed it to something with a more positive meaning by switching out "male" (bad) with "bene" (well).
<ul><li> According to the legend, the name was changed after a battle between the Romans and Pyrrhus (of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> fame), which they had won, hence the transition from "place of ill omens" to "good omens".
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>Norway</h3>
<ul><li> Norway has a few examples. Bergen used to be Bjørgvin, Trondheim was Nidaros (Name history: Nidaros, Trondhjem, Nidaros, Trondheim, Drontheim, Trondheim) and Oslo was Christiania from 1624 to 1877 and Kristiania from 1877 to 1924. Funnily enough, the church provinces around the two first still carry the same name and there is a discussion in Oslo about renaming the center back to Kristiania.
<ul><li> The case of Trondheim is of particular interest in this case, as the name "Trondheim" came out as a compromise. At this point (1930), there was a boost of renaming in Norway, ridding the country of Danish names. The most logical choice was to rename Trondheim with the original name: Nidaros. But the citizens protested against it, preferring to have the name "Trondhjem" ("Hjem" is more "danish" than "heim"). The city went by "Nidaros" for a year, but when the locals resorted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">Torches and Pitchforks</a>, the ruling body quickly succumbed and renamed the city "Trondheim"—which actually made sense, because the area had gone by that name even before any town was founded there.

<h3>Middle East</h3>
<ul><li> An ongoing example is what to call the land that was (indisputably) called <strong>Palestine</strong> for millennia before 1948 (leaving aside that for a lot of that time "Palestine" also included territories east of the Jordan river and — briefly — on the Sinai peninsula). Most Palestinians (and indeed most Arabs and even most Muslims, if they're politically inclined) will refer to the whole thing (including what's now Israel and in some cases Jordan) as Palestine; certain Israelis will refer to the whole thing (including the areas under dispute—and sometimes even Jordan) as "the Land of Israel" (<em>Eretz Yisrael</em> in Hebrew), and no matter what you call it, it has political overtones. The region currently governed by Israel<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7asg6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7asg6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7asg6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although the international community universally regards the area as occupied, the situation is more complicated in Israel; many ultranationalist and religious groups regard it as an integral part of Israel, and prefer the term "disputed territories" when they are forced to recognize that there are a few million Arabs living there who would rather not be ruled by Israel. As a result, even what to call the <em>status</em> of this area—uncontroversial everywhere else—is a politically sensitive topic in Israel. Of course as they say, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JewsLoveToArgue">two Israelis, three opinions</a>."</span> which borders the Dead Sea is known as the "West Bank"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8eq6x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8eq6x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8eq6x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's the western side of the River Jordan, for the confused; the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is the "East Bank", as it were. This is why the West Bank is known in French as <em>Cisjordanie,</em> "on the near side of the Jordan," as opposed to <em>Transjordanie,</em> which is what the Kingdom of Jordan used to be called.</span> by the Palestinian authorities and the international press, while in Israel it is known as "Judea and Samaria"—unless you want to strike a moderate, conciliatory tone towards the Palestinians, in which case it's "the Territories" or the "West Bank" again.
<ul><li> To add to the confusion, up until 1948 Jews living in Palestine were called Palestinians (for instance up until then the "Jerusalem Post" was called the "Palestine Post") while Arabs living in Palestine were called (Palestinian) Arabs.
</li><li> This argument goes way back. When the Roman Empire crushed the Jewish uprising under Bar Kochba (in 135 CE), they merged the province Judea into a larger one which they called "Palaestina", after the name used for the (long since gone) Philistine realm. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note91ji4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note91ji4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note91ji4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And even before that Judea was known as Canaan...</span>
</li><li> Local names for settlements and terrain features have also radically changed in the past 100 years. Many places that had up to that point had Arabic names have been renamed with Hebrew names - mostly after Biblical locales described as being in the same general areas 2000+ years ago.
</li><li> Jerusalem was said to have "70 names", and rightly so. Its name has been changed many times over the past few millennia, whether through conquest, mistranslations, or various local pronunciations. It was originally called "Salem" or "Ur Salem", then "Jebus", then several variations of "Yerushalem" during ancient Hebrew times. During the Jewish exile in Babylonia, it was also called "Zion". Then "Aelia Capitolina" by the Romans who destroyed and rebuilt it, "Hierosolyma" by the Greek translations, later "Jerusalem" by the Christians, "Al-Quds" by the Arabs—which is itself a shortening of the old term "<em>Urshalīm al-Quds</em>" ("Jerusalem the Holy")—and now finally "Yerushalayim" by the Israelis. The last three (as well as "Zion") are used concurrently today depending on one's language and/or political outlook, and many other languages still write or pronounce their own variations as well.
</li></ul></li><li> The capital of <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jordan">Jordan</a></strong>, Amman, was known as Philadelphia during the Greco-Roman era. Doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Egopolis</a>, since it was given that name by Ptolemaic king Ptolemy II Philadelphus after his own epithet ("brotherly love"). Plus, while the current name is older, the full name used to be Rabbath Ammon ("capital of the Ammonites"). The Rabbath part was dropped when the Ammonites ceased to exist as a people.
</li><li> Trucial Coast used to be named the Pirate Coast. After a major pirate hunting operation by the Royal Navy, involving​ a series of truces and alliances with local rulers, it became known under the name "Trucial." Its name now? <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedArabEmirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedArabEmirates">United Arab Emirates</a></strong>.

<ul><li> Mecca (Makkah), the holiest city in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>, was originally called "Bakkah". It's probably a case of sound change, though both names are notable enough to be listed separately in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a>.
</li><li> Medina, the <em>second</em> holiest city in Islam, was called "Yathrib" before the rise of Islam. Oh, and Medina simply means "city" in Arabic; the full name is <em>al-Madinah al-Munawarrah</em> ("the city of light").
</li></ul></li><li> Persia =&gt; <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iran">Iran</a></strong> (in this case reflecting local usage). Persia is a Greek exonym, the Persians/Iranians have been calling themselves some version of 'Irani' as long as they've been a distinct group.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10s8lb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10s8lb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10s8lb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Persia" isn't a complete exonym, however, as while the Persians have always called themselves <em>Irani</em>, their historic heartland was in the region of Parsa in the southwestern part of the Iranian Plateau. To this day, this region is called Fars (or occasionally Pars), and is centered on the city of Isfahan—Iran's third-largest, and widely considered to be one of its richest culturally (for Americans, it's a bit like the Philadelphia or Boston of Iran).</span> (The term derives ultimately from "Aryan," as the ancient Iranians and ancient Indo-Aryans were closely related and were probably two branches of one people, one that went west and the other east.)
<ul><li> Mashhad, the country's second largest city, was originally called Sanabad. It received its present name (meaning "place of martyrdom" in Arabic) when Iran transformed from a Sunni to Shia country, since it was the burial site of Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Twelver Shia Imam.
</li><li> Bandar Abbas, previously Gombrun/Cameron.
</li><li> Gorgan, the capital of Golestan Province, previously Astarabad. Gorgan is rooted in Verkana ("land of wolves"), the Old Persian name for Golestan.
</li><li> Kermanshah was briefly known as Bakhtaran (meaning "western", as it's located near the western border with Iraq) after the 1979 Revolution, since the new government didn't like the "shah" (meaning "king" in Persian) in the name. During the Iran-Iraq War, however, the name reverted back, since the government wanted to rally up nationalism by invoking ancient Iranian culture.
</li><li> Tehran used to have streets with names like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Eisenhower Boulevard</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">Kennedy Avenue</a>," as did many other Iranian cities. Obviously, most of them were changed after the 1979 Revolution.
</li><li> In 1981, Iran also renamed a street after Northern Irish hunger striker Bobby Sands. The street itself? Just happened to be the one where the British Embassy was located. This would have forced the Embassy to put the name of its country's most famous dead dissident <em>in its mailing address</em> had the embassy not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">responded by moving the building's entrance to another street</a>, thus using that street in its address instead.
</li></ul></li><li> The city of Iskenderun in Turkey was originally known as Alexandria near Issos (Αλεξάνδρεια κατὰ Ισσόν <em>Alexándreia katà Issón</em>). This was corrupted into Alexandria Scabiosa, which later turned into Alexandroukambousou. It was referred to by western pilgrims as Alexandretta, and after the Muslim conquest of Syria, it was rendered in Arabic as <em>al-ʼIskandarūn</em>. This became a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheLastCrusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></em>.
<ul><li> This is more the case of changing the name to its equivalent in the dominant language (like Chinese city names being referred by the Mandarin pronunciation rather than the local dialect). Iskanderun means virtually same thing as Alexandretta, as Iskander is simply how the name Alexander is rendered in Arabic. (Same with other cities named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a>. Alexandria in Egypt is called Iskandariyah in Arabic (although hardly anyone outside the Arab world calls it by its Arabic name. Alexandria in Afghanistan is called Kandahar in Pashtun (although no one calls it by its original Greek name.))

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mumbai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mumbai">Mumbai</a>: Formerly Bombay. Somewhat controversial, as Bombay is not an Indian city colonised by Europeans, but rather a city built by the Portuguese from scratch - and anyway, everyone still calls the associated film studios "Bollywood", not "Mollywood".
<ul><li> Even the change itself has not been uniformly applied to government institutions. There is still a university in Mumbai called IIT Bombay, while some foreign languages (Spanish, French) still use the classic name.
</li><li> This caused some confusion in Indian restaurants in the UK with many dishes such as Bombay potatoes and Bombay duck being renamed, though often some would be Mumbai and others Bombay. Thankfully this has largely been undone and they are back to the original Bombay name.
</li></ul></li><li> Since 2001, Calcutta is once again Kolkata.
</li><li> Chennai: Until 1996 used to be called Madras.
<ul><li> In fact Madras and Chennai were the names of two neighbouring villages that were the core of the large city that has grown up around them; it's just that post-independence India preferred to use the name of the one that the Raj didn't use.
</li></ul></li><li> Prayagraj, formerly Allahabad. This one can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">rile up tempers</a> depending on which religion you follow, since the city is named after a God that isn't followed by the majority of the city's population anymore (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">its followers</a> still make up a significant minority). The rename was eventually made official in 2018, but most foreign literature still refer to it as "Allahabad", since it was the city's name <em>before</em> people made a big deal about it.
</li><li> Kozhikode: Formerly Calicut. Varanasi: Former Benares.

</li><li> The Nuristan Province used to be caled Kafiristan ("land of infidels"), because its indigenous people, the Nuristanis, practiced ancient Afghan polytheism. After they were converted to Islam, the region became Nuristan ("land of the enlightened").
</li></ul></li><li> The French overseas department <strong>La Réunion</strong> in the Indian Ocean. First an uninhabited Island called Dina Maghrabin ("West Island") by the Arabs and Santa Apolonia by the Portuguese, it was claimed for France in 1640, named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Île Bourbon</a> after the royal house, and colonized.

<ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a></strong> has lots of cases that look like name changes, although in fact, most of the names have stayed the same in Chinese. The apparent change is due to either the new transliteration system, or due to the government mandating the use of standard Mandarin for placenames rather than local languages/dialects. For further details, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WhyMaoChangedHisName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WhyMaoChangedHisName">Why Mao Changed His Name</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Beijing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Beijing">Beijing</a> (formerly Peking) is the most obvious example of the new transliteration system coming into effect.
<ul><li> After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Peking ("Northern Capital") became Peiping ("Northern Peace", "Beiping" in modern Pinyin), since the Chinese capital was moved to Nanjing/Nanking ("Southern Capital"), until the PRC was declared in 1949, with Beijing/Peking as the capital again.
</li><li> Peking University still keeps the old spelling officially.
</li></ul></li><li> Guangzhou: Formerly Canton, which is derived from the Portuguese rendition of the local name for the province (Guangdong) in which the city sits<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14q03y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14q03y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14q03y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Canton", though etymologically derived from "Cantão" (the Portuguese transliteration of "Guangdong"), refers only to the provincial capital instead of the whole province</span>.
</li><li> Xiamen: Formerly Amoy, a local name which got displaced by its quite different-sounding (although still related) Mandarin equivalent.
</li><li> Other examples of the "different attempt at writing the same basic name" type are Xi'an, Tianjin, and Qingdao (formerly Sian, Tientsin, and Tsingtao, respectively). Xinjiang Province (formerly Sinkiang), and Sichuan Province (formerly Szechuan) are just a few more examples. There are countless others.
<ul><li> Xi'an actually does have a name change: It was known as Chang'an ("long tranquility") while it was the capital, only becoming "Xi'an" ("western tranquility") from the Ming Dynasty onwards, after the capital had become well established in Beijing.
</li></ul></li><li> Kaifeng was founded as Daliang in 364 BC, rebuilt as Bian in AD 781 and also went by Bianjing, Bianzhou and Dongjing.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HongKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HongKong">Hong Kong</a> is a mild example: before 1926 it used to be spelt as one word, "Hongkong". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">Some particularly old institutions still use the old spelling</a>, such as The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).
<ul><li> Incidentally there is a company in Hong Kong called "Amoy Food" based on the old name of Xiamen.
</li><li> A case where the city is no longer a city: the central area of Hong Kong on the north coast of Hong Kong Island used to be referred to as the City of Victoria, which was dissolved into the Central and Western District and Wan Chai District with the handover.
</li></ul></li><li> Transliteration is an occasional problem in other Asian languages also. While elongated "o" sound in Japanese is, in most cases, simply transliterated as plain "o" in English (thus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tokyo">Tokyo</a>), some insist on writing out the "correct" pronunciation as "ou"—thus "Tokyo" would be "Toukyou." While this is nice, it is also highly confusing; thus some have compromised and come up with macrons for long vowels—thus the capital city is spelled "Tōkyō". The macron system is officially preferred (the system using digraphs for long vowels was developed for typewriters that couldn't produce diacritics).
<ul><li> Make that triple in Russian. Not only Cyrillic similarly lacks the easy method of indicating the long vowels, but the official transcription is also <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_orthography">phonemic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, not phonetic, and if read by the Russian orthography rules, sounds entirely wrong. Nevertheless, there are <em>a lot</em> of know-it-alls who insist on "correct" reading of the Japanese words, making it an ample <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">Flame Bait</a>. Not to mention that the official Russian name of the city is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">an artifact of an another, long obsoleted system of transcription</a>, and back in the time when it was still called Edo there were at least <em>four</em> Cyrillic transcriptions of its name.
</li></ul></li><li> While on the matter of <strong>Japan</strong>, in 19th century, Tōkyō was also known as Tokei, based on now obsolete pronunciation.
<ul><li> It used to be called Edo (roughly "estuary", being built on one), renamed when the official capital moved there from Kyōto in 1868. Of course, the move of the "official capital" merely meant that the Emperor moved there; the city had been the seat of government since the 17th century, with the Emperor as a ceremonial figurehead. The period during which Edo was the most powerful city in Japan despite not being the official capital is therefore called the "Edo-jidai" ("Edo Period").
</li><li> The former capital of Japan, Kyōto, was originally called Heian-kyō ("The Capital of Tranquility and Peace"), giving the golden era of the Imperial Court, the Heian-jidai, its name. It was renamed to Kyōto ("Capital City") when that era came to a close. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, it was also briefly renamed Saikyō ("western capital") when Edo was renamed. Before it was the capital, it was named Uda.
</li><li> One more example from Japan and one more former capital (or at least one more site of an emperor's palace - Japan has lots of those): Nara, formerly Heijō-kyō.
</li><li> Japan itself is an exonym. The Ancient Japanese called their country Nifon. One of the old Chinese dialect made it Ciphon. The Portuguese who interact with Japanese call them Jippon. Then English speaking people call it Japan. Modern Japanese for the country is Nippon (a formal, slightly archaic reading) or Nihon (a modern, but also more colloquial, variant).
</li><li> Japanese colonies. Ezo becomes Hokkaido and Ryukyuu becomes Okinawa, though, strictly speaking, Ezo traditionally referred not just to Hokkaido (which was often referred to as Matsumae, after the ruling clan based in Hakodate), but to all lands to the North-East that are claimed, but not directly ruled by the Japanese, including Sakhalin and Kurile islands. When the new Imperial government finally begun to develop the island after the Meiji restoration, they had to invent a specific name for it because it <em>did not</em> have one. And the islands to the southwest are still called Ryukyuu archipelago, they're just administered as the Okinawa prefecture, named after the largest and most populous one.
</li></ul></li><li> Formosa (from "Ilha Formosa" (the beautiful island) by early Portuguese explorers) =&gt; <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taiwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taiwan">Taiwan</a></strong>. Of course, that's just the beginning...
<ul><li> The state that controls the island of Taiwan is the Republic of China (ROC). Contrast the People's Republic of China (PRC), which rules the Chinese mainland (what most people mean by just "China"). Taiwan and mainland China essentially regard each other as rebellious provinces. The ROC lost a civil war on the mainland and was left in control of only Taiwan; decades later, the <em>de facto</em> situation is that Taiwan and mainland China are separate countries. But both the ROC and PRC consider Taiwan to be an inseparable part of China, so anyone who proposes making the <em>de facto</em> situation on the ground official — or who uses terminology that <em>implies</em> that — will attract the ire of both sides.
</li><li> In international sports, to allow people from Taiwan to compete without implying (a) support for either the PRC or ROC over the other or (b) acceptance of the status quo, they need a team name that both sides can accept. "Chinese Taipei"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15h2r9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15h2r9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15h2r9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Taipei being the main city of Taiwan and the capital of the ROC</span> is the name in the Olympics and many other major competitions.
</li><li> Naturally Taiwan has independence movements, people who would like to renounce the claims to the mainland and make the <em>de facto</em> situation official. But even if they ever gained a supportive majority in the ROC government, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseWithChopperSupport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseWithChopperSupport">the PRC would respond forcibly to any assertion of independence</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Another example is the disputed islands in the East China Sea that China, Taiwan, and Japan all claim as their territory. Japan, which currently controls the islands, calls them the Senkaku Islands. Though China and Taiwan are allied in this dispute, they too have different names for the islands. China calls them the Diaoyu Islands while Taiwan calls them the Tiaoyutai Islands.
</li><li> The capital city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SouthKorea">South Korea</a> was originally <em>Hanseong</em> (City [by] the Han [River]). When Korea was annexed by the Japanese in 1910, it was renamed <em>Keijou</em> or "the Capital City" in Japanese. Korean independence caused it to be renamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seoul">Seoul</a>, meaning simply "capital city".
<ul><li> However, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage">Chinese Language</a> the name was still a cognate of <em>Hanseong</em> (<em>Hànchéng</em>) up to mid-2000s, when Seoul requested the city should be called <em>Shǒu'ěr</em>, a closely phoneticized form, in Chinese. The shock waves at the time caused <em>several local songs to be written</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">incorporate</a> this event.
</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h3>South-East Asia</h3>
<ul><li> Ho Chi Minh City: Formerly Saigon, a name still used by a lot of the locals, the name was changed after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>, although its three-letter airport code is still SGN.
<ul><li> Coincidentally, this removed a possible confusion in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HongKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HongKong">Hong Kong</a>, which has a district with the same name in Chinese (西貢, albeit written as Sai Kung in English).
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Myanmar and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Thailand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Thailand">Thailand</a></strong>, <em>entire countries</em> whose names changed from Burma and Siam, respectively. The former change is highly controversial, with several governments and the opposition not accepting it. This is because the name was changed by a military junta which overthrew the democratically elected Burmese government.
<ul><li> Burma/Myanmar also changed the name of the city of Rangoon to Yangon.
</li><li> Burma/Myanmar is a bit of a confusing case, since both names are effectively the same word in Burmese. Myanmar (pronounced Myama) is simply a more formal version of Burma (pronounced Bama). (Blame the British for the "r"s.)
</li><li> The city of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok#Full_name">Bangkok<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had its name changed back in the late 1700s. Nobody outside of Thailand uses the new name, which happens to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">"Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Yuthaya Mahadilok Phop Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit"</a>, which translates to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongName">"The city of angels, the great city, the eternal jewel city, the impregnable city of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous Royal Palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukam"</a>. No wonder most people stick to "Bangkok" (if they're foreigners) or abbreviate it to its first two or three words (if they're Thai).
</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Singapore">Singapore</a></strong> — formerly Temasek.
<ul><li> An interesting example in that it was permanently changed by a colonist, Sang Nila Utama, who named the place after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">an animal he reckoned had to be a lion</a> — hence <em>Singa</em>(lion)-<em>pura</em>(city).
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines">Philippines</a></strong>, curiously enough, is the exception to the rule, as it's retained its Spanish colonial name, although it was originally lumped with other islands into a group collectively called the Spanish East Indies. Most likely this is attributable to Spanish still being a primary official language, not to mention the fact that the country didn't exist as a political unit before Spanish occupation.
<ul><li> During the Martial Law era in the 1970s there were plans to rename the Philippines to "Maharlika", after the precolonial warrior class (but only of Tagalog kingdoms). That proposal has lately resurfaced in the late 2010s as a show of anticolonial symbolism.
</li><li> The entire Philippines itself actually countshaving been named for the Spanish King Philip II. Prior to Spanish colonisation the archipelago was ruled by a number of largely independent but interconnected royal city-states, such as the Kingdoms of Tondo and Maynila, the Rajahnate of Cebu, the Kingdom of Butuan, the Sulu Sultanate, and others.
</li><li> The term "Manila", the name of the current Philippine capital, is a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a>; its meaning has evolved over the centuries. Originally it referred to the precolonial Kingdom of Maynila south of the Pasig River (which itself used to be named "Selurong" or "Seludong"); after the conquistadores arrived, "Manila" became Intramuros, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitadelCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitadelCity">Citadel City</a> the Spanish built over the ruins of the Kingdom of Maynila. Much later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties">during</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaTakesOverTheWorld">American</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">occupation</a>, Manila's jurisdiction expanded beyond Intramuros and grew to encompass surrounding districts. Today "Manila" has come to refer to both the country's capital <em>and</em> the conglomeration of sixteen cities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndZoidberg">(and the single municipality of Pateros, and the disputed-over central business district of Bonifacio Global City)</a> situated in the regionwhich is more accurately called "<em>Metro</em> Manila", but visiting foreigners and out-of-towners don't make the distinction.
</li><li> There's also an old Filipino joke that street names tend to change with every new administration, largely out of a need to satisfy political egos.
<ul><li> In the most recent case, several Filipino politicians, in a bid to ingratiate themselves to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereditaryRepublic">(second)</a> Aquino administration, even filed a bill to change the name of EDSA, Metro Manila's main highway<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note169e8n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note169e8n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note169e8n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which itself used to be called Highway 54 in the 1950s, and Junio 19 before <em>that</em></span>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Egopolis">Corazon Aquino Expressway</a> (after the mother of the previous President, Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino III, who was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">also</a></em> a former President). In their defence, the Aquinos are intimately associated with the highway, the site of popular protests that threw the Marcos dictatorship out in 1986 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution">installed Cory Aquino in power</a>. Quite a number of Filipinos continue to believe, however, and not without good reason, that the politicians pushing the name change have a slight case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">Skewed Priorities</a>, given much more urgent issues like disaster management, poverty, and of course their own corruptionnot to mention the monstrous daily traffic jams and train breakdowns now a feature of present-day EDSA.
</li><li> The bill never passed, however, and there are no plans so far to refile it in the 17th Congress (that is, the Congress that assumed office after the May 2016 elections).
</li></ul></li><li> A few major streets may or may not have changed names for ostensibly nationalist reasons. For instance, Dewey Boulevard, which borders Manila Bay, was later renamed Roxas Boulevard, after the Philippine President Manuel Roxas. Ironically the said President was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">extremely subservient towards American interests</a>when the Americans granted the Philippines its formal "independence" in 1946, Roxas was promptly installed as the Republic's first chief executive, and in order to finance the rebuilding of the country after the devastation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, he had to play nice with the U.S. government. (The American legacy associated with Dewey/Roxas Boulevard is still evident in the fact that the U.S. Embassy is still headquartered there.)
</li><li> The barangay of 1896th Street in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Trias,_Cavite">General Trias, Cavite<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was formerly known as 96th Street, but was later renamed to commemorate Andres Bonifacio who once resided in the village during the Philippine Revolution, though residents would sometimes colloquially refer to the street under its old name.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Indonesia">Indonesia</a></strong>:
<ul><li> The country itself, known before 1945 as Dutch East Indies.
</li><li> Before that collectively (Indonesia as a national identity didn't exist until Dutch colonization) as Nusantara (Lands in Between [referring to Indonesia's position "between" South China Sea and Indian Ocean and role as trade hub]). Another name was Majapahit, the only pre-colonial Indonesian state whose territorial expanse matched the Dutch rule (in fact, it's actually larger, spanning parts of modern-day Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. However, it was also much looser, because Majapahit seemed to consider nominal tributaries enough to claim lands as their own).
</li><li> Sunda Kelapa received the Sanskrit name Jayakarta (City of Glory) after Fatahillah, the general of the Sultanate of Demak, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoodenShipsAndIronMen">defeated the Portuguese</a> in the 16th century. When the Dutch took over a century later, they gave it the name Batavia (after Bataaf people who are believed to be ancestors of Dutch). When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Japan took over</a>, Jayakarta was restored, albeit shortened to "Jakarta".
</li><li> The country's second largest city, Surabaya, was called Hujung Galuh before the 14th century.
</li><li> One of Jakarta's satellite cities, Bogor, was called Buitenzorg during the Dutch era. And before the Dutch arrived, when it was the capital of a precolonial kingdom, it was Pakuan Pajajaran.
</li><li> Papua Barat to Irian Barat (Barat means "West" in Indonesian) to Irian Jaya then changed back to the local preferred name Papua. Western literature still calls it "West Papua", but in Indonesia, Papua Barat technically refers to a province split off from Papua in 1999.
</li></ul></li><li> Portuguese Timor: Timor Timur (Indonesian for East Timor) since 1976 to 1999 and after that Timor Leste.
</li><li> Batang Berjuntai, a town in <strong>Malaysia</strong> was renamed to Bestari Jaya.
<ul><li> Lots of other examples in Malaysia too, where English city/town/road names were replaced with Malay ones. One entire state in one case: as mentioned above, British North Borneo became Sabah. Its state capital as well: Jesselton became Kota Kinabalu. Averted in some cases: George Town, the capital of Penang, though there is a common Malay name (Tanjung).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Malaysia">Malaysia</a> as a whole country counts as well. It was the Federation of Malaya when independence was gained in 1957. The country name was change to Malaysia in 1963 when British North Borneo, Sarawak and Singapore joined the federation.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Cambodia</strong> was (briefly) renamed to <em>Democratic</em> Kampuchea during the reign of Khmer Rouge. This didn't last long.
