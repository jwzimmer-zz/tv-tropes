</p><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a> that serves no purpose other than to be <em>excessively cruel</em>.
</p><p>The Cruel Twist Ending is basically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding">Karmic Twist Ending</a>: in the latter, the twist is a form of divine justice, a bad thing happening to stop a bad person from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">getting away with it</a> (or a good thing happening to someone who deserves it). In the former, it's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw">Finagle's Law</a>: the universe is a mean place and wants to hurt you.

It can be used for cruel irony and very dark humour but has to be undeserved and unsatisfying in order to be different from the karmic one.

<ul><li> An awareness campaign about child dyslexia showed a young boy sitting listlessly through a prizegiving ceremony at school, aware that he hasn't done well enough in any of his classes to receive a prize. Suddenly, his name is called, and he discovers he's won a prize for art and design (the only subject that involves little reading and writing) - then finds out his prize is a book token.
</li><li> British charity St. John Ambulance, which trains people in first aid and provides voluntary first-aiders in the community, ran an advert showing a father undergoing cancer treatment. He survives, but then at the party intended to welcome him home from the hospital, he chokes to death because no one knows how to do first aid. The intended message was that the death rate from cancer is only slightly higher than that for people who could have been saved by basic first aid knowledge.
</li><li> A controversial GoDaddy.com ad intended to run during the Super Bowl featured a puppy named Buddy getting separated from his owner and trekking a long distance to return to her. She is happy to see him...because she just sold him on her GoDaddy-hosted website. The ad drew ire from many viewers, with some activists accusing it of promoting puppy mills, and it was withdrawn.

<ul><li> One episode where Kino helps a stranded group of people survive a harsh winter, we found out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were slave traders who had eaten their previous haul and look to enslave Kino to make up for it.</span>
</li><li> Another episode has Kino visiting neighboring countries who used to constantly be at war. When Kino asks how they achieved peace, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she finds the opposing countries have made their battles into a game in which both countries see who can slaughter the most inhabitants of an adjacent defenseless village.</span> And just to twist the knife further, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "innocent victims" in that village have taken to senselessly murdering travelers, simply as a means of venting their frustration.</span>

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShadowStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShadowStar">Shadow Star</a></em> manga, ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shiina's mother being killed, her best friend killing herself, her boyfriend dying of cancer, her monster partner dying, and then Shiina fully realizes her God powers and decides to destroy the entire planet and reboot the world with her and another girl's children.</span> And this is AFTER they've defeated the Big Bad.
</li><li> Most chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NightmareInspector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NightmareInspector">Nightmare Inspector</a></em> generally seem like they'll end happily, with the client apparently getting over their nightmare's troubles, until some reveal or twist comes out of nowhere and sends things into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitterSweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitterSweetEnding">bittersweet one at best</a>.

The final few pages, focusing on the best friend, reveal that in a few days time, she'll kill and eat the protagonist too.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: Luffy ran a "rescue Ace" mission for several dozen chapters to save his brother from being executed, sacrificing years of his life and culminating in his arrival at Marineford during the Paramount War, where he was out of his league and sustained even more injuries. And after everything Luffy went through to save him—after he'd <em>successfully freed him</em>—Ace was goaded into a fight and died anyway, becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadSerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadSerious">the first named character in the series to die onscreen outside of a flashback</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a>:</em>
<ul><li> <em>Midsummer Chart</em>: The main character of this episode works at a food store and is depicted as a self-centered jerk who gets angry at nearly everything, planning to send people who've aggravated him to hell for petty reasons (including one guy just for dating the girl he was lusting after). He draws violent comics about these people. Mid-episode, he meets a girl who he seems to have chemistry with, and though he starts to draw self-obsessed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment">Wish Fulfillment</a> comics about her as well, he is shown to actually start caring about someone else's feelings. He enters these comics into a contest and actually wins. On a bike ride home, he notices the girl who lusted after trying to jump off a bridge. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, he turns back around immediately to try to save her. She tells him her boyfriend played her and three other girls as well. He comforts her and walks her home, afterward he vows to send her ex to Hell for what he did to her and the three other girls, feeling that it's wrong to break a girl's heart. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But he can't, because HE is being sent to Hell by the girl who he just saved. She regrets telling him about what happened and fears that he'll tell everyone.</span>
</li><li> Another episode revolves around a girl about to use the Hell Correspondence to punish an evil old woman who's holding her dogs and the puppies one of them had hostage (and has already killed one of the dogs) in exchange for making the girl her slave. Meanwhile, Hajime tracks her down to try and stop her from doing so. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the end, the police storm the woman's house and arrest her, and it seems like Hajime succeeded...until the girl discovers that the old woman had killed the second dog and all of the puppies, and pulls the string on her curse doll anyway, damning both the old woman and herself to Hell.</span>
</li><li> Hell Girl does this a lot. Like the first episode of Season 1, the first episode of Season 2 is about a cute school girl getting bullied. Unlike the Season 1 episode, however, the girl or none of her classmates know who's doing the bullying. Her school locker is filled with caterpillars. Her uniform and text books are filled with writing, calling her horrible names. And she is stalked and harassed whenever she is alone in school. A school nurse notices and feels sorry for her. She befriends her and things seem to be looking up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then a female classmate shows the girl the nurse's office, which is filled with the stuff that was used to bully her. The nurse then reveals herself to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a> who is obsessed with her, right down to having a mannequin that looks like the girl. She threats to pour acid on her face, if she doesn't agree to join her in terrorizing other students, starting with the girl who revealed she was the bully. She gets sent to hell.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> OVA <em>Legend of Kenshiro</em> ends with this.

In the final moments of the movie, Kenshiro is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">the only survivor</a> and can't do much but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">cry</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">scream</a> into the ruins. The only thing that saves the ending from complete despair is the sequence that comes after, which has him making his way to a certain village, home to two certain adorable kids and menaced by a certain mohawked scumlord, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/FistOfTheNorthStar">"The Road of Lords"</a> plays.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoujo">Shoujo</a> horror anthology <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZekkyouGakkyuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZekkyouGakkyuu">Zekkyou Gakkyuu</a></em> makes heavy use of these as well.
<ul><li> One of the earlier examples being <em>The Kind Mama's House</em>, in which the child protagonist discovers her online friend, "Mama", is apparently stalking her and plans to kill her mother so she can be the protagonist's "real" mother. She manages to rescue her mother and demands Mama go away, and she does... Only to show up in the protagonist's house days later, having decided simply to <em>kidnap</em> the girl, just like she did numerous others before her.
</li><li> One of the special chapters <em>Guard of the Mountain</em> has a small group of camping-trip students getting lost with their teacher. They make it to a little camping ground and the owners merely ask them all to be 'on their best behavior' while staying. People begin to disappear and the owners turn out to kill people, who do not treat nature well, by littering or other means. After running away and falling, protagonist Hitomi finds herself taken in by a young couple and she realizes that she's managed to get away, only for the couple to bring her to the previous, dangerous camping grounds. And an extra page shows that the murdering owners opened up a beach house, implied to continue their little 'test' on people.
</li><li> The <em>Girls and Boys</em> story has Yuuki think that boys have it easier, as they don't bully each other or gossip a lot and wishes that she'd be a boy and promptly finds herself in a parallel world, where she is 'Yuuki-kun'. But she soon realizes that boys are just as likely to bully and gossip about each other, sometimes worse than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShoujoBullyingTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShoujoBullyingTactics">girls</a> do. To top it off, Yuuki realizes that she still feels like a girl, even in a boy's body, and falls for 'his' best friend, Inoue. During a confession, turns out that this world's male Yuuki had a crush on Kaho, but then the entire class begins to tease Yuuki over being gay for Inoue and Yuuki ends up beating his tormentors to death with a chair. Wishing for things to go back to normal, Yuuki finds herself back as a girl and is intent on just being happy with the person she is... only to learn that the same thing happened here (with the original male Yuuki having confessed to Kaho and being teased as lesbos) and Yuuki has killed several of her classmates with a pair of scissors.
</li></ul></li><li> The post-apoc manga <em>Meteor</em> ends like this. Throughout the entire series, characters try to find food, shelter, locate their families...and most die before they can achieve this. Then the few survivors left reach a village, but everyone there starts to go insane. <em>Then</em> some government officials arrive and say there was no end of the world, but the town and the village were used as experiment-grounds for new weapons and drugs, and that the seemingly-insane people will be given proper treatment in their hospital. But the protagonist wants to take the sweet little boy, who went insane and ran off earlier, with them, and she and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> go to find him. <em>But</em> in trying to catch him, the protagonist and the little boy fall off a cliff, becoming gravely-injured. The protagonist calls up at a-bitch to help them... only for the girl to run back to the rescue-helicopters and lie that both the protagonist and the boy went crazy and died. The manga ends with the protagonist screaming and crying for help as the last of the rescuers leave before sadly accepting her and the boy's fates as they slowly bleed to death.
</li><li> Viewers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano">Saikano</a></em> often comment that if you want a happy ending to the series you should stop after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shuji and Chise skip town and go on the run from the military</span>, because the final three episodes go quickly, horribly and tragically downhill after that.

It is downplayed, however, in that Ken manages to survive the long-ass fall and eventually rebuilds his mafia empire by taking over America</span>.

Ultimately, the only solution our heroes can think of is for Goku to ask for help from Omni-King Zeno... who sees the situation, dismisses it as "hideous" and promptly <em>annihilates Trunks's entire timeline</em>.

Eventually she comes face to face with Kardem and engages him in a lightsaber duel.

</li><li> <em>Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Negative Exposure</em> is a mini-series following <em>Daily Bugle</em> photographer Jeffrey Haight. While Jeff has had some success as a professional photojournalist, publishing a book of crime photos due to his connections in the police evidence locker (his girlfriend is a cop who works there) he has never met his true goal, landing a photo on the front page. He's obsessively jealous of Peter Parker, a "stringer" (slang for a freelance photographer, or amateur), because Peter <em>always</em> gets great and dramatic photos of Spider-Man on the front page out of what Jeff attributes to luck, while Jeff's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">careful planning and studious work never does the trick.</a> (Jeff clearly can't put two-and-two together.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eventually, after his goal becomes an obsessive rivalry against Peter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a> takes notice of Jeff's attempts to photograph him, and feigns interest in his work, arranging a prison interview.

(Jeff assumes Ock is giving him a chance at the photo shoot of a lifetime.) However, Ock kills several civilians when he escapes, and threatens to kill more as Spidey finds him; Jeff eventually has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a>, and uses his camera's flash to blind the villain, but after Ock is defeated, he's still arrested, his girlfriend dumps him, and his life and career are ruined. Here's the cruel twist: He convinces Spidey to submit the pictures he took, and he <em>does</em> make the front page, the picture getting there the one that went off when he flashed it in Ock's face. Then he realizes <em>why</em> it's such a good photo. It looks exactly like something Peter would have taken. As a final kicker, Ock is seen reading the story in his prison cell in the last scene. "Excellent!" he says, admiring the great photo of himself.</span>

Out of bullets and unable to kill himself, he notices the mist dissipating, and hears a strange noise which turns out to be the military, destroying the monsters. So, if he had waited literally one minute before killing everyone, they all would have survived. What makes it worse was the realization that one of the objects in the background of the reveal scene is army-standard temporary housing. They weren't being followed by the military, <em>they were driving through a military outpost</em>! One film critic was so bothered by the ending that he spoiled it (with ample warning) in his review to keep people from being blindsided by it.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CountYorga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CountYorga">Count Yorga</a></em> series loved these in its movies despite all the heroes' efforts and killing the title character. Endings are as followed...
<ul><li> In the first movie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Two of the male protagonists are dead and the last one finds the damsel with Yorga. He manages to stake Yorga (albeit accidentally) and saves the girl. However even with Yorga dead, his victims don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">go back to normal</a>. Meaning a female friend who was turned by Yorga remains as an evil vampire. She and another vampire bride come after the two but the protagonist chases them off with a cross. No sooner then when he turns around however, the girl he saved reveals she's now a vampire and lunges at him. The last shot of the movie is the bloodied face of the protagonist from the aftermath of the feeding.</span>
</li><li> The sequel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once again had nearly all the rescuers dead and a number of their female friends turned into vampires and under Yorga's command. The last rescuer is able to find the girl and they try to escape. Only to be cornered by Yorga. He takes the girl and leaves his vampire brides to finish the rescuer. Just as Yorga is about to bite the girl, the rescuer escapes and chases the two to the balcony. A fight ensues where Yorga is staked and killed. All seems well and the girl hugs her rescuer, however she pulls back and sees that he's deathly pale and has bite marks on his face (apparently having been bitten by the brides and the vampirism just now taking hold). Instantly he forgets about rescuing her and goes for her neck, dooming her to become a vampire which he was trying keep Yorga from doing not seconds ago. If that wasn't bad enough, Tommy, an orphan Yorga hypontized to help him is still under the vampire's control and stripped of his morality meaning he's not afraid to kill. Plus <em>none</em> of the vampires in the movie save Yorga was staked. Meaning they'll soon spread their vampirism to the defenseless orphanage next door and likely to the rest of the town as well. Just...sheesh.</span>

<ul><li> Of course, your mileage may vary.

</li><li> The French black comedy <em>The Red Inn</em> is about a family of 19th-century innkeepers who kill their guests to steal their money. The only guest that knows the truth is a priest who can't expose them because he got the information during a confession he was tricked into performing. The plot devolves into a series of progressively wackier shenanigans as the priest tries to get the other guests out of the inn alive, leading said guests to think first that the priest is crazy, then that <em>he</em> is the serial killer. The police are called and they arrest the priest. Thankfully, they discover an older body, free the priest and arrest the innkeepers instead. In the final scene, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the guests pack and leave the inn, only to fall down a ravine to their deaths when they cross a bridge the innkeepers had sabotaged earlier just in case their planned victims managed to escape.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberMe">Remember Me</a></em>, if not for the ending, is a heartwarming tale about a man's path towards rekindling his connections to his family.

Except it turns out she was vampirized and was living in sunlight using sunscreen lotion. Which makes no sense considering the evil vampire queen had set her up for some sort of ritual and her and her entire clan was wiped out, so if she was vampirized why did she stand there while all her brethren were being slaughtered?
</li><li> In <em>The Rapture</em>, Sharon, a former swinger who joined a Christian cult, has a vision of her dead husband beckoning her to the desert. This is interpreted as God asking for her to wait for Him there so she can be taken up to Heaven when the Rapture happens. She and her daughter go to a desert and wait for a couple weeks, but she starts to question if the Rapture will actually happen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When Sharon runs out of food and loses her patience, she shoots her daughter, is arrested, and loses total faith in God. The twist is that the Rapture actually happens; when she and the officer who arrested her are in Purgatory, the daughter shows up and says they can get into Heaven if they love God. The officer states his love for God and goes to Heaven, but Sharon refuses to love God after what has happened to her. Her daughter then fades away asking if she knows how long she'll stay in Purgatory, and she replies "Yes... forever." Then it slowly fades to black with no music playing over the credits.</span> The feeling you get after watching this movie is similar to getting slapped in the face.

Then the twist comes...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the killer was the victim's teenage sister, and she's only 17, not 18 as the detectives had initially believed. This means everything she said outside the presence of her parents is inadmissible.

So, great, he's learned about historical people, right? Well, no; Brin is then told that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is <em>also</em> a Reborn, but was raised from birth in the future society rather than the simulation.

Some notable examples:
<ul><li> "Tempests": In order to save a space colony, a man must figure out which of the two realities between which he's switching are real, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">seemingly perfect one</a> or the darker one. He makes the "right" choice - and we find out that <em>both</em> worlds are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus Eater Machines</a>. His real situation is much worse: he's cocooned by giant spiders and slowly being eaten, and as a result of his failure everyone presumably dies.
</li><li> "The Deprogrammers": A group of humans beat alien brainwashing and eventually manage to take down the villain — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">just as a rival alien had arranged</a>, as it turns out. Once they've done his dirty work for him, they're turned into <em>his</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">Brainwashed</a> slaves.
</li><li> "Hearts And Minds": A group of soldiers fight the good fight against bizarre invading insectoid beasts, only to find that the "medication" given to them by their leaders is making them see their actually-human enemies as bugs. They lay down their weapons and try to talk to the enemies... who promptly kill them all, being under the influence of similar drugs and seeing our protagonists as monsters.
</li><li> "Straight And Narrow": <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolForScheming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolForScheming">An exclusive private school</a> brainwashes its students for use as mercenaries, similar to the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DisturbingBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DisturbingBehavior">Disturbing Behavior</a></em>, which it predates. The one student who is immune to the process manages to escape and tell authorities — who prove to be alumni, and drag him back to undergo the procedure (now corrected to work on the likes of him) as the assassination he'd tried to prevent is successfully carried out.
</li><li> "Quality of Mercy": A captured space pilot comforts the girl he's imprisoned with when the aliens start turning her into one of them. To give her hope, he says there's a secret reserve force waiting to strike at the aliens. Just what she wanted to hear, because she was a spy, and they're changing her <em>back</em> into an alien.
</li><li> The writers continued that story in "The Light Brigade" just to squash any hope the viewers had. Due to the aforementioned episode, the aliens begin winning the war. In a last-ditch effort, humanity tries to surprise attack the alien homeworld with a planet-killing WMD. The fleet is ambushed and the ship carrying the device is crippled, and everyone is killed immediately or knocked unconscious and given a fatal dose of radiation which will kill them soon. The hero manages to unmask a traitor, get to the destination and drop the bomb before his ship can be boarded. Unfortunately, the ship had been <em>turned around</em> whilst everyone was unconscious - the hero has just heroically ensured that the bomb was dropped on Earth!
</li><li> "Dead Man's Switch": A fleet of alien spaceships are seen heading toward Earth. Knowing they might be evil, a Doomsday plan with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadMansSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadMansSwitch">Dead Man's Switch</a> is prepared, with five people in individual bunkers sharing the responsibility to prevent the doomsday plan from being enacted (should it become unnecessary) by regularly pressing a button to keep the doomsday device from turning on. The five people in the bunkers are gradually killed off in variety of ways. The brief hope for peace is extinguished when a second fleet of colonization ships is found and the button pressers lose all contact. They die in their separate bunkers one by one until the last one remains. He finally decides to let it happen when he gets a message from his commander telling him they defeated the aliens with a new weapon. He stops the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomsdayDevice">Doomsday Device</a> at the last second and is told to keep pushing the button until they can disarm it.

</li><li> "Mind Over Matter": A man creates an AI machine to reach into a female coma patient's mind to help wake her up. It's a living dream and he falls in love with her cute avatar in the dream.

The patient then dies because the cute avatar was the AI all along.
</li><li> "In Our Own Image": An android programmed to be a soldier who wants to live a life of peace escapes from the lab and gets a ride from a random lady he carjacks. She helps him escape and attempt to get the items he needs to remove his safeguards and be free. At the last second before he's truly free, she reveals she was one of his programmers and shuts him down. She wanted to see what he could do before she stopped him. Unfortunately for her and humanity, he had identified her beforehand, turns himself back on, kills her, and starts a robot uprising.

The aliens are interrogating them about the mission and the device and attempting to reverse engineer the device. The creator is one of the persons being interrogated, and in going over how the device is triggered activates it with an override to prevent it from being disarmed. At this point it's revealed it's all been an elaborate simulation to see how they would stand up under stress and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthAllAlong">they've been on Earth the entire time</a>. Since they've trained so hard with the bomb, they had to use the real bomb with an inactive trigger to simulate it correctly. The creator noticed and fixed it as part of her manual override.

Standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TownWithADarkSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TownWithADarkSecret">Town with a Dark Secret</a> plot, right? Suspecting her baby will be a monster or something else she contacts an FBI agent who at first thinks she's crazy. The actual babies are never seen, and the surrogate mothers don't like to talk about them afterwards. When the big day comes and the FBI agent busts in to stop the evil birth... Only to discover the entire thing was a breeding operation for aliens. The alien's birth occurs when the alien growing in her womb eats all of her except her skin.

One of the young men was a Southern fanatic who thought the South should have won and the battle was glorious. Being in the real battle under an insane commander dying of meningitis disabuses him of the notion. The time traveler sought to teach him that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a>, because otherwise he would shoot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">the first black U.S. President in 2013</a> when the president spoke at Gettysburg due to his Southern sympathies.

</li><li> "A New Life": This episode's premise may remind some fans of Shyamalan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVillage">The Village</a></em>. Two married couples join a cult that resembles Puritanism, because their lives have become unfulfilling. The problem is, no one remembered how they reached the forest they were brought to, because the cult leader knocked everyone unconscious en route. At first, the protagonist seemed okay with his new life until the cult leader borrows his child and brands him. After the protagonist gets his son back, he panics and convinces his wife to flee from the village with him. Soon, they realize the forest's edge is blocked by a force field, and stay on the run, but their branded child was used as a tracking device. As a result, the couple was discovered by the cult leader and captured. For fleeing, the protagonist would be executed, so he helped convince his male friend (played by Jeremy Sisto) to help him escape and de-activate the force field. The plan goes well at first until the two of them find a teleporter. The protagonist volunteers to enter, while his friend protects his wife. After entering the teleporter, the protagonist was transported to a dark room with several robed people. The people in robes? Oh they're aliens. They also claim that the forest is <em>inside a spaceship</em>, they've already left Earth, and they plan to use religion to encourage people to breed for the next 500 years...which is when they'll reach their destination and use the humans as <em>slave labor</em>. Of course, the protagonist gets killed for knowing too much, though his partner met a grisly end. The cult leader burns him at the stake to urge people not to rebel. Even better? His wife watches him get roasted.
</li><li> "Breaking Point": A guy makes a time machine and travels a few days into the future, but finds out his wife is dead. Horrified, he returns to the present and tries to protect and warn her.

Anguished, declaring himself a monster, he decides she would have been better off without him, so he travels back to the day they met and kills his past self before he met her, erasing himself from existence. It was all for nothing. In the new timeline, it turned out that his wife had been contemplating suicide and meeting him that fateful day had saved her.
</li><li> "First Anniversary": Two best friends are both married to kind, loving women who look like supermodels, so they think life is good. But one day, one of them goes nuts, claims that the women are monsters, then commits suicide. After the funeral, his friend is baffled, until he starts to feel revulsion whenever he's around the girls (when he tries to kiss his wife, he smells and tastes something nasty). He fears that he's losing his mind, until the girls feel they have no choice but to confess. They are really aliens that crash landed on Earth. Since they can't leave, they decided to blend in and live the rest of their lives peacefully as human women. The reason his friend called them monsters and that he's feeling disgusted by them is that prolonged contact with them causes the person to develop an immunity to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">Glamour</a>. His wife tries to persuade him that no matter what they look like, they are still the nice women they befriended and fell in love with.

The women move on and seduce two new guys, meaning the cycle will repeat itself roughly once a year.
</li><li> "The Grid": A man on a road trip stops at another city and finds that an evil organization has installed the buildings with antennas that emit a mind-controlling signal as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> plot. Since the protagonist is immune, the brainwashed citizens are ordered to kill him. He escapes and returns to his hometown, intending to call the cops, only to find more antennas. His brainwashed wife shoots him.
</li><li> "The Human Factor": On the first ever colony on Ganymede, a robot suddenly rigs the reactor to blow up. The robot explains that since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Humans Are the Real Monsters</a>, its logical course of action is to destroy the colony and prevent humanity from expanding beyond Earth.

The survivor receives a message from Earth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> broke out, and nukes have wiped out a lot of the planet (including the survivor's family). A shuttle carrying the President and other officials is heading for Ganymede and will arrive in a few months. In despair, the survivor re-rigs the reactor to blow and turns the robot back on. He tells the robot it was right, then offers to play chess to pass the time until the colony is blown to kingdom come (though this one skirts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding">Karmic Twist Ending</a> a bit).
<ul><li> It turns into an outright cruel twist ending if you accept it as a true sequel to "Phobos Rising" instead of just another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> episode attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding">Arc Weld</a> unrelated episodes.

He eventually discovers that the Ripper is actually an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surfing</a> alien. While it is in the body of an old woman, he fights and stabs it, only for the alien to exit the body and escape. The police arrive and arrest the protagonist, assuming that <em>he</em> is the Ripper. The alien, in a new body, visits the protagonist in the asylum and promises to find his family and kill them before leaving.
</li><li> "Blank Slate": A man with amnesia is pursued by mysterious agents for the device he's carrying. A woman is caught up in the events and teams up with the man. While on the run, they slowly fall in love. Unfortunately, when his memories come back, it turns out that he was working with the bad guys before. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance">Reverting to his original evil personality</a>, he betrays the woman and returns the device.
</li><li> "Birthright": The protagonist believes he has thwarted an alien invasion... only for the taxi driver to reveal himself as one of them and capture him. The infiltration was more widespread than he thought.
</li><li> "The Voice of Reason": A man appears before a government committee to warn them about alien infiltrators. They dismiss him as a nut. Suspecting the official who opposes him the loudest is an infiltrator, the man shoots and kills him, hoping to expose his alien nature. The official was human and a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">muggle</a>, and the man is arrested. <em>Nearly everyone else</em> in the committee is an alien, and they silently thank the man for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">getting rid of that guy, allowing them to take full control and further their invasion plans</a>.

And it turns out the protagonist <em>had managed to convince the human official</em> that aliens could be a legitimate threat.
</li><li> "A Special Edition": A guy appears on a talk show to present evidence that the government is performing illegal cloning experiments. The government cuts off their signal and sends armed thugs into the studio. The guy, cast, and crew try to escape, but are eventually captured. A clone of the guy appears and gives a fraudulent report that "disproves" the guy's evidence. The clone mocks the protagonists, claiming that the masses are stupid sheep who believe anything they hear, so his fraudulent report is already making them forget the truth. The guy, cast, and crew are all shot to death by the clone.
</li><li> "Human Trials": A group of soldiers sign up for a top secret mission. To "weed out the wimps", the soldiers are placed in virtual reality simulations (the kind where you can feel everything) of battles, natural disasters, etc. Those who die, crack, or give up in the simulations are eliminated and sent home. In the end, only one soldier makes it. After the round of congratulations, he eagerly asks what his mission is. He is then informed that there was no mission; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">For Science!</a>, they were looking for someone really tough so that they could use him as a guinea pig to test the limits of human endurance and willpower.

</li><li> "Manifest Destiny": A spaceship investigates a distress call from an abandoned spaceship. While exploring it, the crew begins to grow paranoid and insane, one by one. The doctor tries to figure out what is going on, but is too late and succumbs as well. The alien virus that caused this is unknowingly sent to Earth. This does overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding">Karmic Twist Ending</a> seeing how the virus was the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">humanity destroying the aliens so they could colonize their homeworld for themselves,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">with the doctor comparing it to how the wars with Native Americans ultimately caused syphilis to be carried to Europe.</a>
</li><li> "Final Appeal": A woman time travels to the future and is arrested because technology is banned. She goes on trial and tries to convince the leaders to bring technology back, because she has seen futures where humanity is screwed without technology. A second time traveler arrives with a nuclear bomb and threatens the leaders to keep technology banned, because he had seen futures where humanity ended up screwed over because of technology. After a long debate, the leaders decide to lift the ban and everyone seemingly convinces the second time traveler not to kill them and to return to his own time. He leaves... but leaves the bomb behind and it explodes, wiping out the city.
</li></ul></li><li> Every story from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightVisions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightVisions">Night Visions</a></em> ended this way, but a few episodes deserve special mention because their protagonists aren't in any way evil, or even mean-spirited. There's no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> here, just the universe being really nasty:
<ul><li> "Now He's Coming Up the Stairs" had Luke Perry as a psychiatrist who could heal mentally ill people by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicHealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicHealer">absorbing their problems and neuroses onto himself</a>. He uses his powers to help a child who, after being in a car accident with his mother, believes that the victim in the accident is after him; the boy constantly chants "Now he's coming through the woods, now he's coming through the yard, now he's coming in the house, now he's coming up the stairs." The psychiatrist takes on the boy's paranoia, which heals him, and even manages to fight off the delusion of the dead man attacking him and the family—except he doesn't. He's actually gone irreversibly insane and is trapped forever in his own head, repeating the "Now he's coming through the woods" mantra. The last shot is the psychiatrist rocking back and forth and reciting. The end.
</li><li> "If a Tree Falls..." has three college students accidentally drowning in a car accident—but since no one saw them die, they're still alive. One of the kids has strong religious convictions and can't bear the pressure of keeping their secret, so he decides to free his body from the wreck and move on to Heaven. You might expect that he succeeds, with his friends eventually realizing he was right—but the exact opposite occurs: he accidentally releases his two colleagues' corpses, which sends them into the afterlife, but in doing so sends the car plummeting to the bottom of the lake where they crashed, where it can never be found by anyone. He's now trapped on Earth forever, functionally immortal and completely alone.
</li><li> "Neighborhood Watch" is particularly effective, as it relies on realistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a> rather than supernatural elements. A close-knit community is sent a letter with a warning that the newest occupant of the neighborhood is a dangerous child molester. A father, seeking to defend his daughter, eventually kills the man, and the other neighbors back him up...and then a second letter arrives, telling everyone that the first letter was a mistake, and the murdered man was completely innocent.
</li><li> "Harmony" has a drifter who wanders into a town where music and singing is outlawed due to fear it will attract a monster. The drifter and a like-minded mother and child try to convince the townspeople this is nonsense, but they form an angry mob and attack them. Against all odds, the drifter manages to sing "Amazing Grace", and nothing happens. The townspeople joyously start singing and celebrating him as a hero for banishing their superstitions... then the monster shows up and kills them all.
</li><li> "A View Through The Window" has a farm surrounded by an impenetrable forcefield materialize in the desert. The military investigates, and finds that the farmers inside cannot see or hear them, while they can only see and not hear them. One soldier, depressed by the loss of his family, observes the farmers and begins to fall in love with a lovely woman among them who seems to be as sad and lonely as he is. The soldier notices that the forcefield goes down for brief periods at a time. Eventually, when the forcefield goes down, the soldier jumps into the farm, deciding there is nothing left for him in his original world and wanting to be with the woman. The inhabitants immediately transform into hideous monsters and tear him to pieces. His horrified comrades try to save him, but the forcefield goes back up before they can. The monsters then start testing the forcefield, waiting for it to go down again so they can escape to the outside world.
</li><li> "My So-Called Life and Death" begins like a typical family vacation comedy, and ends on a note reminiscent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheOthers">The Others</a>. An angsty teenage girl is stuck on a vacation with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily">Dysfunctional Family</a>, including her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">bratty</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac">Pyromaniac</a> little brother (who seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">gets away with everything</a>), her controlling mother, and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">meek, ineffectual father</a>. She develops a crush on the handyman next door, but he doesn't seem to notice her at all (and, when she tries to touch him, passes right through her). The girl tries to tell her family that their neighbor is a ghost, but her mother insists there's no such thing as ghosts, and yells at her to stop ruining their vacation. Undeterred (and excited by the idea of romancing a ghost), the girl finally succeeds in making contact with the handyman — only for him to scream and run away in horror, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">she</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">is the ghost</a>.</span> It turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her brother set fire to the family vacation home one night, killing them all in their sleep; the handyman is the house's new owner</span>. When the girl (now able to see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her home as a burned out wreck, and herself as a disfigured corpse</span>) confronts her family, her brother denies that he's done anything wrong, and her mother angrily and fearfully demands that she continue upholding the fantasy that they're a normal family on vacation. The girl recites her mother's mantra, "There's no such thing as ghosts", and opens her eyes to find that everything has returned to normal. The episode ends as she sits down to lunch with her family, her mother cheerfully stating that she hopes the vacation lasts forever — and giving her daughter a hard look when she hesitates to agree. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The entire family is trapped for eternity in a delusion, unable to move on, because their matriarch can't face the reality of what's happened to them (or the role she played in it).

(In the second case the man finds he finally has time to read all the books he wants — until he breaks his glasses.) It's the same twist in both episodes, but in "The Mind and the Matter", the man is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisanthropeSupreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisanthropeSupreme">Misanthrope Supreme</a> who wills everyone else away, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">his eventual fate karmic justice</a>. In "Time Enough at Last", however, the man is a timid man who is ridiculed by his wife and boss for reading books, and who only survives a nuclear holocaust because he locked himself in a bank vault as the only way he could get some peace. In this case, the world screws him over just to be mean. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> claims that he was being punished for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">being antisocial</a>.

<ul><li> The very first episode featured a rebel-lite teenage girl destroyed by the above-mentioned sealed-off modern community with the obligatory nasty secret, and along the way helps her younger sibling become an accomplice to a fairly grisly act. There was no sci-fi in her fate, more Sopranos — and the sick twist is, in her depiction, she was no more a 'true' rebel than the oldsters in the original TZ's "Kick The Can" were really all that old. The would-be "rebel" many RL parents would be happy to get has some tattoos and some 'tude, and that's really about it.
</li><li> There was the time travel episode where a woman decides to kill an evil dictator as an infant by posing as his nanny. The baby was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, and she succeeds. However, another nanny who saw what happened replaces the baby with another child, the implication being that the new child is the Hitler we had to deal with.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Goosebumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Goosebumps">Goosebumps</a></em> stories made heavy usage of cruel twist endings, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouAfraidOfTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouAfraidOfTheDark">Are You Afraid of the Dark?</a></em> were more prone to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding">Karmic Twist Ending</a>. It is perhaps the reason why the former is considered to be scarier. A notable exception is the <em>AYAOTD</em> episode "The Tale of the Chameleon", featuring Tia and Tamera Mowry as the protagonist and her evil clone. The episode ends with the girl's friend being forced to decide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotTheImposter">which one is the real person</a> - and choosing wrongly. The clone keeps her human body, while the girl is changed into a chameleon and left to drown at the bottom of a well. This episode always rates highly in fan polls.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearItself">Fear Itself</a></em> heavily favored the cruel twist ending route during its short run:
<ul><li> "The Sacrifice": A man manages to kill a vampire, freeing the last survivor of an isolated town whose inhabitants have been sacrificing their own happiness to keep the vampire at bay for centuries. Then at the last minute, it turns out that he was bitten. (This is perhaps foreshadowed, however, with the fight that shows the vampire's power to teleport and turn invisible — or, at the very least, move so fast that it might as well be — meaning that it could have bitten him at any time.)
</li><li> "Spooked": A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop">Rabid Cop</a> confronts the childhood trauma that led him to be such a monster, and refuses to cross over the line to become an actual murderer, and, now aware and able to deal with the trauma of his past, swears to live a better life and do the right thing from now on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Then he's accidentally shot dead by his partner</a>.
</li><li> "Family Man": An accident somehow switches the souls of an auditor and family man and a fleeing serial killer called "The Family Man", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">trapping them in each other's bodies</a>. The protagonist finds himself staring down the death penalty and a world that despises him, while his family is in the hands of a monster (who, while he claims he wants to look after "his" family, is clearly a ticking time bomb from his psychosis). When the protagonist finally escapes, he makes his way to his house and engages in mortal combat with the impostor...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then he's shot dead by a policeman.</span> But wait...! <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The auditor finds himself back in his own body: the process is reversed.

The daughter survives and fingers him as he breaks down in sheer horror and despair</span>. He's escaped one level of hell only to plunge headlong into an even crueler one, and there's no escape from this. One of the proposed titles of this trope was the "Family Man Twist", by the way.
</li><li> Which one "New Year's Day" falls under is really up to the individual viewer. The twist: Our heroine, who has been spending the entire day trying to survive a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">zombie apocalypse</a> and get to her friends' apartment, while being followed by her zombified boyfriend, turns out to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have been a zombie all along. When she and her boyfriend get to her friends' apartment, they eat them.</span>
</li><li> At least "Community" gives us a warning at the start with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a> scene of the protagonist running away in fear.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">Bratty Half-Pint</a> little sister knocks the stone with his name out of the fire, which according to the myth, means that his soul will be taken by the Cutty Black Sow. The rest of the episode consists of him jumping at every sound and seeing a pair of yellow eyes through windows... until the end, where his parents come home from Grandma's funeral and his father comes up to tuck him into bed. Where's the twist? He embraces his father, relieved that it's over... and his father turns into the Cutty Black Sow. The boy is paralyzed with fear as the demon leans over him... Yeah, that's what you GET for trying to save your grandmother's soul, kid!
</li><li> "Effect and Cause": An aging hippie with a broken leg and her boyfriend witness the world's chaotic nature coming to a head, with things spontaneously happening, appearing and disappearing at random. They're both amazed, but she is really excited to be seeing the nature of the very universe. So... what does the universe do? Spontaneously change around the furniture as she walks around, causing her to fall and land on her broken leg, spontaneously cause some events that make the cops come to her house, spontaneously turn on the gas on the stove, and cause the broken doorbell to cause a spark and blow up the house while she can't do anything but watch it all unfold. Pretty vindictive for random chaos.

After it captures a popular girl from school, a pizza man, and the protagonist's brother, she and her male friend pour blood on it, causing its multiple heads to kill each other in hunger, and free the victims. She and her brother then burn the poem in the fireplace before going up to her room to sleep. Later that night, the parents discover the poem, having reconstructed itself, in the ashes, and read it out loud. As they laugh about how silly the poem sounds, there's a creaking noise on the porch...the protagonist opens her eyes in terror...and all the lights in the house go out. Cut to black. Voiceover: "Happy Halloween..."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHauntingHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHauntingHour">The Haunting Hour</a></em> TV series has these endings in nearly <em>all</em> of their episodes.
<ul><li> The first example was in "The Dead Body", in which the main character strikes a deal with a new kid in school to help him prank a couple of bullies. Afterwards, the new kid insists that the main character "owes him". It turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the new kid is a ghost, and the main character is sent back in time to prevent his death. The main character does so...only to die in the ghost's place, and the now living ghost returns to the present to live out the main character's life.</span>
</li><li> In "The Girl In the Painting", we follow a girl named Becky, who dreams of living a better life than the one she lives now. Becky finds a mysterious painting with real characters living inside of it who want her to come to their world so she would live a better life like she dreamed of. Becky gets swept up in her dreams and enters the beautiful painted world. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then it turns out that the people inside of it wanted to use her to feed a monster inhabiting their world so they wouldn't get eaten themselves. The episode ends with Becky getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive">Eaten Alive</a> and revealing that the titular girl inside the painting doesn't like her own world, questioning why Becky would want her life.</span>

She soon runs away from her family to live with the living building forever so she can finally be happy, but she soon sees that her own parents are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">desperately searching for their missing girl</a>, proving that they do indeed love her. Upon realizing the mistake she made and knowing that her romanticized life with her house won't be as fantastic as she thought it was, Alice finally parts ways with her living house peacefully. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Unfortunately, it turns out that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">house</a> refuses to let her leave and murders her (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">possibly</a>) by absorbing her body within its walls so she'll be a permanent part of it forever.

However, it's rendered moot because Seamus reveals that Greg's soul belongs to him anyway because his own great grandfather offered Seamus his grandson's soul anyway as tribute so he could keep his own. The episode ends on Seamus lunging at Greg to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">rip his soul out by force</a>.

</li><li> "The End of Time" has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">the Tenth Doctor</a> trying to prevent a prophecy of his demise which will come at the hands of someone who will "knock four times". This seems to refer to the Master, who has a four-beat drumming sound (the heartbeat of a Time Lord) constantly in his head, and nearly ends all of creation when he uses it to resurrect the Time Lord race. After saving the day, Ten is overjoyed to have escaped his fate, only to hear four taps: his companion Wilfred has become trapped in a radiation venting chamber, and to save him, Ten must take his place, accept his fate, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">regenerate</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">the Eleventh Doctor</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Exodus": The raft crew are found by a nearby boat. They've finally found rescue! Oh, wait. It turns out The Others are in fact REAL and "the boy" they were coming to take was Walt, not Aaron! Within the next few minutes, the raft is destroyed, Jin and Sawyer's fates are left unclear, Walt is taken, and Michael is left alone in the dark waters screaming for his son.
</li><li> "Exposé": The episode begins with the deaths of Nikki and Paulo. As the other survivors try to discover what killed them, we are treated to flashbacks, gradually approaching the present day. It turns out that they're NOT dead, just in a severe state of paralysis from a spider bite. Their friends don't know this though, and bury their fellow castaways alive.
</li><li> "Through The Looking Glass": The survivors have made contact with the approaching freighter, ten Others are dead and Charlie has avoided his predicted death. Then, one of the Others turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>, the freighter is revealed to have not been sent by who they think it was, Naomi is back-stabbed by Locke (literally!), and Charlie dies in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. On top of all that, the episode's Jack-centric flashbacks showing him broken and suicidal are actually flash<em>forwards</em>, showing that he does eventually do what he's been attempting for three seasons and escape from The Island ... only for it to be a poisoned chalice and completely destroy his life. So much so that he manically attempts to return! To say that the final scene completely changed the show for good is an understatement.

Some of them are very minor and are just "boo, something else scary happened" (e.g. a giant spider is killed, but suddenly a frog jumps out of the sink; a ghost stops haunting two kids because her doll was returned, but a new doll suddenly opens its eyes). Others imply the characters are still in major danger. However, the show tones down the scariness by implying that the stories are just stories being read by a babysitter to two kids.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hollyoaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></em> had an episode where, after Jade Albright waits nervously for the results of a biopsy to see whether she has cancer, the test comes back negative. Jade celebrates her sixteenth birthday with everyone she cares about, gets together with her crush, and her foster family formally adopts her. Various problems of her friends and sister get resolved too.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackMirror">Black Mirror</a></em> has them frequently, although sometimes it's hard to determine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding">if the cruelty was deserved</a>. For instance, Series 3 has two in a row:
<ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorPlaytest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorPlaytest">Black Mirror: Playtest</a>" features a man participating in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainComputerInterface">BrainComputer Interface</a> test in order to generate a properly scary experience for a horror game. After experiencing his worst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fears</a> and two fakeouts involving him thinking he left the game, he's finally taken out and sent home, only to find his mother is showing symptoms of Alzheimer's, one of the many fears explored in the game. He breaks down in tears upon realizing this. You'd think it would end there, but it gets worse: He never started the game in the first place. The man died within 0.04 seconds of strapping himself in due to leaving his cellphone turned on. The staff notes he spent his last moments convulsing and calling out to his mother.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorShutUpAndDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorShutUpAndDance">Black Mirror: Shut Up and Dance</a>" had some people who were manipulated into doing things (from simple delivery to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">Duel to the Death</a>) to prevent their secrets from being leaked online. After the main character successfully completes his final, bloody task, they still have the data released to humiliate them one last time. Interestingly, the episode also seems to aim this trope at the <em>viewer</em>. That innocent-seeming teenager we've been following the whole episode? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's a paedophile who was caught watching child pornography.</span>
</li><li> Season 4 pulls this off again in a <em>particularly</em> cruel fashion with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorCrocodile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorCrocodile">Black Mirror: Crocodile</a>". In a society where people's memories can be viewed by a device called an "adjuster," a woman starts a murder spree to erase all evidence of a crime she commited. As she's walking out of the house of the couple she recently killed, she comes across their infant son, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">implications are clear.</a> At the ending of the episode, which confirms she has indeed killed a <em>baby</em> to get away scot-free, it's revealed that the kid was <em>blind.</em> Meaning he wouldn't have seen anything incriminating her in the first place. And to make everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">even</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">worse,</a> she killed all those people in vain anyway, because it turns out that the technology works on the family's <em>guinea pig</em> and the police were able to use its memories to track her down. <em>Wow.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> A staple of the short lived horror series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Darkroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Darkroom">Darkroom</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Stay Tuned, We'll Be Right Back" - a man digs up a old radio that allows him to send messages back in time, saving his father from a fatal mission in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and assuring an Axis victory.</span>
</li><li> "The Bogeyman Will Get You" - a teenage girl (played by a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HelenHunt">Helen Hunt</a>) becomes suspicious of her nighttime-hours keeping neighbor, believing he's a vampire. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She confronts him about it, under the light of a full moon...</span>
</li></ul></li><li> One of the short stories featured on <em>Crackanory</em> had a man pass out drunk on his stag night only to wake up in an abandoned hospital and under attack by three zombies. At first he is running scared of the zombies and fears for his life but eventually realises he will eventually be killed by just running and must survive for his future wife's sake. Thus he manages to kill the zombies and escape the hospital. He leaves fully expecting a zombie apocalypse outside however he is met with laughter from his mates. It turned out that they had set the whole thing up as an elaborate stag night prank and the zombies were actually actors hired by them. As a result he was now facing a triple murder charge instead of a wedding. The ending implies he goes on to kill his mates too via the camera ominously focusing on his weapon.

<ul><li> The country music standard "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia". The song starts off as the narrator talking about a murder that occured in Georgia with a man murdering his unfaithful wife. The narrator mentions in the chorus that an innocent man was hanged. Near the end of the song, you learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the innocent man was the betrayed husband. The true killer is the innocent man's sister. She killed her sister-in-law for cheating on her brother. So basically an innocent man was killed for a murder his sister committed.

This was partially motivated by Tom Batiuk being in a contract dispute and wanting to discourage his syndicate from claiming and using the character, but Batiuk later stated the the primary goal was to give the strip (which was on the verge of cancellation due to the TV pages - which the comic was usually run on due to its TV-oriented humor - being crowded out by the explosion in cable channels) a dramatic sendoff rather than let it "wimp off into the sunset."

Marble Pie and Big Macintosh had blatant romantic tension in every scene they showed up in together, but Big Mac instead ends up dating Sugar Belle.
