</div></div><p>An odd phenomenon in some video games with guns in that any ammunition you pick up works with either any gun whatsoever or an entire class of guns. In the real world, cartridges have a variety of different calibers, lengths and propellants based on a number of factors, including desired stopping power, target penetration, and the amount of recoil and gas pressure needed for a semiauto or automatic weapon to cycle itself (or, the other way around, prevent it from exploding in your face).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>These cartridges are then loaded into clips and magazines<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0pg9g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0pg9g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0pg9g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">clips feed magazines and magazines feed guns. Clips were the most common way to load guns in the days of everything having an integral magazine, but nowadays they're rather rare; if you are asking for a box of bullets that you will shove up the handle of a handgun you want a magazine</span> designed for specific weapons, so that even if the cartridges are identical between two or more guns, you'll have to unload and reload one painstaking round at a time before you can take advantage of it; nevermind the question of where you're getting the empty magazines from. Sitting down and filling up mags is "not always an option" in a pitched firefight, and largely qualifies as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreakFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreakFromReality">Acceptable Break from Reality</a>. This trope is similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">One Bullet Clips</a> since both of them treat ammunition like water that's just decanted into a container of the right type when needed; here the container in question and its contents can magically change depending on what it is being attached to, whereas there it's more about the way every magazine not being held is immersed in the ammo-liquid until it is as full as possible.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Before adding examples please keep in mind that a lot of weapons from video games are based on real-life weapons. Many military and civilian weapons very intentionally use common "standard" ammunition sizes and magazine types (like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NATO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NATO">NATO</a> 5.56 and 7.62 rounds for assault and battle rifles). Most 5.56mm weapons use the magwell dimensions specified under the draft STANAG 4179, meaning one can take a magazine from any such weapon and use it in another. However, if the magazine is interchangeable but visibly different depending on the weapon (for example, a steel 30-round magazine for an M4 turning into a polymer PMAG when it's put in an HK416) it is still this trope. If two weapons that have interchangeable ammunition in real life use <em>different</em> ammunition in the game, it is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted example</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>"Compatible magazines" is an important distinction: if a Luger, MP40, MP5 and Glock 17 all share a "9mm ammo" pickup, there's still behind-the-scenes magic going on. Let's say you pick up a 32-round MP40 magazine under the above. You can use it to reload the 8-round Luger, the 17-round Glock, and the 30-round MP5. This could only really work if you picked up the MP40 magazine itself along with four empty Luger mags, 2 empty Glock mags, and 2 empty MP5 mags. Obviously, you didn't just pick up nine magazines, eight of them empty, so instead of having magic transforming bullets you have a magic transforming magazine.
</p><p>Note that most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons">Energy Weapons</a> batteries/power sources, in contrast to the panoply of batteries in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, are portrayed as universal. Just pop in a random battery and they're good to go.
</p><p>In fictional settings, such as science fiction, this is sometimes purposely justified by declaring there has been a worldwide standardization causing an actual adoption of universal ammunition or some sort of literally universal ammunition that's capable of reconfiguring itself to completely differing weapons.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenEye1997">GoldenEye (1997)</a></em> has two main types of ammo, pistol and rifle. No matter what pistol or submachine gun you use, it'll take the same ammo. Likewise, no matter what rifle you pick up, it'll take whatever rifle ammo you have. However, there are unique types of ammunition specific to certain weapons such as rocket ammunition for the rocket launcher or shotgun shells for the shotgun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectDark">Perfect Dark</a></em> and its prequel have more weapons with unique ammo types, but otherwise retain the same ammunition setup as in <em>GoldenEye</em>, changed only to add a third category for SMG ammo. Even funnier is that there are some alien weapons in the first game which draw from these pools (and some of them even have reloading animations of putting an extra glob of goob into the gun!) - good thing the Skedar chambered their handguns for 9mm, right?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a>: Allied Assault</em> has wildly different guns from four nations all accepting the same carts and mags if they're the same "type" (pistol, rifle, etc.). The original PSX game averted this for pistols and sub-machine guns (for instance, salvaged 9mm guns would not give you ammo for your .45 Colt or Thompson), but played it straight with rifles. The 2010 reboot switches to the standard modern system of weapons sharing ammo based on real-world caliber, and also allows you to ask certain allies for more ammo regardless of whether he would logically be carrying that kind of ammo on him.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonorVanguard">Medal of Honor: Vanguard</a></em>, enemies sometimes drop ammunition boxes instead of their weapon, which always gives the player ammunition regardless of what weapon the player is using.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldIsNotEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldIsNotEnough">The World Is Not Enough</a></em> handled this differently depending on platform. While the PS1 version identified <em>every</em> ammo type specifically by what weapon it went for - so, for example, having several mags' worth of TMP ammo wouldn't help you keep your P99 or silenced MP5 loaded - the N64 version instead identifies regular ammo types by caliber. For the most part, ammo is only shared by weapons that do, in fact, fire the same bullets in real life (ignoring the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">One Bullet Clips</a> issues that result), but there are still some oddities resulting from the fact that ammo is only identified by its diameter, so for instance you're perfectly capable of keeping the 7.62x51mm MSG90 or SSG 3000 loaded by salvaging dropped 7.62x39mm AKS-47s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> Once upon a time, picking up <em>any</em> weapon dropped by a dead player gave you half of your maximum ammunition, even if it was something like the Pyro's flamethrower, the Soldier's rocket launcher, the Demoman's bottle, a wooden bat, 150kg of metal in the shape of a minigun, or a <em>dead fish</em>. Spies could also somehow recharge their cloak meter with these same objects, as could the Engineer regain metal to build sentry guns and teleporters (where this got odd is that dropped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceHat">hats</a> gave no metal, despite them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">being made out of enough of the stuff</a> to craft at least <em>36</em> weapons). With the Gun Mettle update, a dead player will drop both the weapon <em>and</em> a medium ammo pack. The dropped weapon instead can be freely picked up and used by another player of the respective class until their death or the end of the match.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokerNightAtTheInventory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokerNightAtTheInventory">Poker Night at the Inventory</a></em>. According to the Heavy, his minigun uses ammo with classified diameters so that his enemies cannot use it. It could be a case of not being able to <em>manufacture</em> more, but even then it's still absurd.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em>:
<ul><li> Averted to a slightly unrealistic degree at times in the earlier games. Even the normal and sniper versions of a weapon did not have interchangeable ammunition; while in some cases like most bolt-action rifles this was at least slightly-accurate since attaching a scope made it impossible to reload them using stripper clips (ignoring that your character could just remove the bullets from those clips and load them individually), it was even the case when the weapons <em>should</em> have used exactly the same ammunition loaded exactly the same way, like the Sten being nearly-impossible to replenish despite taking the same ammo as the MP40s every other German soldier drops, or a scoped Mosin-Nagant reloading with clips anyway (your character's hand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">dutifully clipping right through the scope</a> to do so) but still not being able to take more from unscoped ones.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Call of Duty 4</a></em> changed this around and would allow you to take ammo from any dropped weapon if it fired the same kind of bullet as what you already had, and if it isn't already the exact same gun you're using, the gun itself would stay on the ground in case you wanted to swap for it. Somewhat oddly, you can also increase the amount of maximum ammo for a gun by carrying another one that shares ammo (such as the 5.56x45mm M16, M4, and/or G36C, which falls into this when you're using two guns that are clearly <em>not</em> using the same magazines). Multiplayer and later games are a bit stricter, where attachment differences don't matter, but what type of gun it is does - e.g. you could get ammo for your M4 with grenade launcher from dropped M4s with red dots, ACOGs, or nothing, but would be shit out of luck trying to take ammo from an M16, even one with the same grenade launcher attached. In singleplayer this isn't very limiting for the most part, as you typically have the same gun all your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> allies have (thus allowing you to replenish yourself from their guns when they die) or are given a unique gun with a ridiculous amount of ammo to start with (the silenced ACR with a red dot sight and heartbeat sensor from the <em>MW2</em> mission "Cliffhanger" holds over a <em>thousand</em> bullets in total - more ammo than an entire fire team would be expected to have on-hand in reality), and stolen enemy guns are easy to keep loaded too because enemies all use a million AKs and one or two other guns depending on the mission.
</li><li> Multiplayer in later games would occasionally go back to ridiculously strict requirements to pick up ammo from another gun on the ground (some games don't let you take ammo from a dropped gun, even if it's the same weapon with the same attachments, if the <em>camo pattern applied to it</em> is different from yours), but games since <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> also allow this to be played ridiculously straight with the "Scavenger" perk - every casualty (except those killed by explosive weapons in later games) will drop a backpack with one full magazine for whatever guns you're carrying, another piece of your primary equipment, and one special grenade. In <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, this backpack also contains a 40mm grenade or four shotgun shells if your gun has the grenade launcher/shotgun attachment. Yeesh, good thing the enemy didn't know they were carrying all this stuff... Amusingly, the perk is also available in the singleplayer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOpsII">Black Ops II</a></em>, which is probably even more ridiculous than multiplayer, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> combined with it allows you to replenish ammo for various one-off futuristic weapons by picking up packs from people in a time period <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">before those weapons even existed</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyZombies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyZombies">Zombies mode</a> also uses this, which is probably to be expected since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">it isn't even trying to be realistic</a>. Save for purchasing a weapon from off the wall and then going back to purchase ammo, any manner in which you can replenish your supplies will refill everything you have, whether it's a revolver that predates either World War, a submachine gun from the 1960s, a belt-fed machine gun from the <em>20</em>60s, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">retro-futuristic raygun</a> developed by Nazi super-science.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TurningPointFallOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TurningPointFallOfLiberty">Turning Point: Fall of Liberty</a></em> suffered from a glaring lack of ammo commonality. No two of the game's many 9mm weapons could share ammo. In fact, if you had the scoped and unscoped versions of the same gun, they still do not share ammo. Did we mention the game was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a>?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnemyTerritoryQuakeWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnemyTerritoryQuakeWars">Enemy Territory: Quake Wars</a></em>, the Strogg use the exact same pickup for all their ammo and their health restoration. This would normally fall under Justified Examples... except that the pickup in question was established in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeIV">Quake IV</a></em> to be a specially treated slurry of liquefied human remains, and could not conceivably function as ammunition for <em>anything</em> except a particularly disgusting squirt-gun. Even more glaring is that some Strogg weapons (namely the nailgun) use physical projectiles, as opposed to plasma/generic energy, so you couldn't even say the ammo's powering the gun's internal generator, unless it's also somehow used to fuel a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">replicator</a> stored in the gun.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry1">Far Cry 1</a></em>, the MP5 and P90 use the same ammo, with boxed "SMG" ammo found in the game having "9x19" written on it. Right ammo for the MP5, but absolutely wrong for the 5.7x28mm P90.
<ul><li> In the various sequels (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry2">Far Cry 2</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3">3</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3BloodDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry3BloodDragon">Blood Dragon</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4">4</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry5">5</a></em>), all weapons of the same type (with distinctions for which slot they go in for <em>2</em>) use the same ammunition and can get more by walking over any other weapon of its type dropped by dead enemies. This means, for example, as of <em>Far Cry 4</em> the pistols are all simultaneously chambered in .45 ACP, both 9mm Makarov and Para, .44 Magnum, 7.63mm Mauser, .455 Webley, and .50 Action Express. And that the same ammo pickups feed sniper rifles chambered for 7.62x54mmR, .308 Winchester, .50 BMG, and a <em>.700 Nitro Express hunting rifle</em>. They apparently tried to justify this for the automatic rifles in <em>Far Cry 2</em>, where they all use 7.62mm bullets in real life (even going out of their way to include an obscure 7.62mm predecessor to the AR-18 rather than any form of M16), but they ignored the fact that the AK-47 doesn't use the same 7.62 bullets as the others; conversely, this also means that the player in that game can be carrying two 40mm grenade launchers or 12-gauge shotguns at the same time and <em>not</em> share ammo between them for no other reason than because one of them is being used in place of a pistol and the other in place of a rifle.
</li><li> Most ridiculously, in <em>Far Cry 2</em> "flame" ammo is shown as a small gas can, which can somehow morph into magnesium flares for a flaregun.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>'s pistol and submachine gun use the same ammunition. This isn't a problem with regards to the Glock and MP5, using 9mm pistol ammo, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> arises in how Gordon transfers the ammo between guns (he likely does so the same way he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">transfers bullets between half-used magazines</a> - that is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">his HEV suit does it for him</a>). However, the Hi-Def pack - an overall graphical upgrade - changes the Glock into a Beretta and the MP5 into an M4 assault rifle. That creates a new problem - the M4 uses 5.56x45mm ammo, not 9x19mm. Another problem comes when combining the <em>Opposing Force</em> expansion with the Hi-Def pack, which adds an M249 SAW that should share ammo with the M4, but doesn't. This was fixed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> port, which used the hi-def models, added a separate ammo type for the M4, and does not include the weapons from <em>Opposing Force</em>.
<ul><li> Totally averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>, as every weapon uses unique ammunition that even has a unique world model (so the submachine gun ammo appears as an ammo box correctly labeled as holding 4.6x30mm ammo which is visibly distinct from the ammo boxes for the pistol, and grenades for its launcher are noticeably different from the hand-thrown ones). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBulletClips">One Bullet Clips</a> still apply.

The game does occasionally feature unique versions of guns chambered for a different ammo type or, in later games, the ability to convert a gun chambering Warsaw Pact ammo to use the equivalent NATO caliber (and vice versa) by visiting a tech.

Later games gave the two weapons separate ammo pools, culminating in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournamentIII">Unreal Tournament III</a></em>'s minigun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">firing Tarydium shards rather than conventional bullets</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GunsOfIcarusOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GunsOfIcarusOnline">Guns of Icarus Online</a></em>, players can equip special ammunition to apply various advantages and disadvantages to their weapon. Special ammo works in any weapon, regardless of whether the weapon is firing bullets, missiles, or burning gasoline.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/PlanetSide">PlanetSide</a> 2</em>, unlike its predecessor, uses universal ammunition for its weapons. An engineer dropping an ammo pack will refill <em>anyone</em>'s ammo; be it the slugs for a Gauss Rifle, caseless ammo for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Mini Chaingun</a>, the plasma batteries for a Lasher, or the high-explosive rockets for a Decimator.
</li><li> The primary and secondary weapons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> use separate ammunition pools, but ammunition pickups restore ammo for almost all weapons (though different weapons and ammo types replenish at different rates; a box of ammo from a dead street cop will probably give you anywhere between three to twelve bullets for your assault rifle, but only one or two extra shells for your secondary shotgun, possibly not even that if loading it with slugs or explosive shells). An attempt at justification can be seen in the ammo pickups having multiple ammunition boxes clustered together, but that does not explain why a player who only needs shotgun ammunition somehow makes all of the handgun ammo from a pickup vanish, or why a policeman only armed with a single 9mm pistol is also carrying boxes of shotgun shells and 5.56mm bullets on him... or why those shotgun shells and 5.56mm bullets can also turn into rounds of nearly any other caliber, including 9x18mm Makarov, 4.6x30mm, 7.62x39mm, .30-06 Springfield, or even <em>25 and 40mm grenades</em>. Nor does it explain how a player filling up on saw blades from an ammo bag, which <em>looks</em> to be filled only with magazines for specific assault rifles, somehow reduces the amount of .50 BMG ammunition available for a Thanatos-equipped player.
<ul><li> Then this trope is averted to the other extreme with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">Akimbo</a> skill/perk. A player may wield two of most handguns or submachine guns as a primary and another of the same type of gun as a secondary, but ammunition for each is distinct and separate.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Blockstorm</em> uses a system similar to the above-mentioned <em>Call of Duty</em>'s Scavenger perk. Every time a player dies they drop a backpack, and any other player who picks that up before it disappears gets one full magazine for both of their weapons and one more round for or instance of their explosive weapon, regardless of what either player is using. The backpack also gives a full refill for the placeable team-colored blocks, even if the killed player had none left themselves. This gets particularly silly following the update that added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> to the game, where <em>they</em> can pick up those backpacks to get more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">Arm Cannon</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">gatling</a> ammo and another rocket, too.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EightBitKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EightBitKiller">8Bit Killer</a></em>, you have a single type of ammo which is used by all weapons in your arsenal save for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyWeapon">the handgun</a>. Even a <em>rocket launcher</em> accepts these bullets.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield</a></em> series has generally zig-zagged this. Individual weapons tend to have their own specific ammo counts, even in games letting you use two of the same type of weapon loaded in the same manner, e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield4">Battlefield 4</a></em> not letting you borrow shells from your secondary "Shorty 12G" to load up any of the primary shotguns like the 870 or SPAS-12. The Support class's Ammo Box, on the other hand, will refill ammo for <em>anyone</em> on your team regardless of what weapons they're using - to use <em>BF4</em> as an example again, an Assault player with a 5.56x45mm rifle and 40x46mm grenade launcher, a Recon with a 5.8x42mm rifle and a .357 Magnum revolver, an Engineer with a .45 ACP submachine gun and 5.7x28mm handgun, and a Support with a 7.62x54mm machine gun and 25x40mm grenade launcher will all replenish ammo for all of their weapons from the same ammo bag, with only the explosive weapons regaining ammo at a slightly slower rate.

Ammo is used for your Desert Eagle, Shotgun, and Assault Rifle, though the minor pickups only show 3 Desert Eagle rounds (the Major pickups show one of each round). Pipe Bombs are used for Pipe Bombs and the RPG. Energy is used for the De-Mutator (a glob-throwing weapon that de-mutates any mutants you run across) and Pulse Rifle.

On the one hand, different weapon types requires different ammo, you cannot just stick ammo for a pistol in a 40mm autocannon, or ammo for a .30-cal into a .50-cal machine gun. On the other hand, ammo can be used across any gun as long as they are of the same type, leading to a Colt 1911 (chambered for .45 ACP) being able to use ammo taken from an enemy with a Luger (chambered for 9x19mm).

This is not as inexplicable since you custom-make all of his weapons yourself, with the exception of his starting weapon, which the first upgrade is created from by using it as a base. In this case, you're modding the rifle to the ammo, most of which you can make yourself as well.
</li><li> All weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> that use the same caliber take the same ammunition. The issue of different cartridges in the same caliber is ignored, magazines/clips/belt links don't need to be kept track of, and characters seem to load mags in the heat of combat.
<ul><li> Possibly justified by the fact in a world with definitely limited ammunition guns would be modified to accept the most common types.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> has a car that can be recharged by both Small Energy Cells and Fusion Batteries - themselves used as clips for a wide assortment of energy weapons.
</li><li> Due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">bug</a> in <em>Fallout 2</em>, the P90 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> gun was originally loaded with 9mm ammo, which was extremely rare and only designed to be used in this one gun (it wasn't even the only specialized 9mm ammo, either - elsewhere in the game is a Mauser that takes 9mm (ball) ammo). However, once emptied, it then took extremely common 10mm ammo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Lincoln's</a> Repeater (an authentic Henry Rifle) uses the same ammo as the .44 revolver. A .44 Magnum round might <em>fit</em> inside a Henry rifle, but the rifle's pin would hit the wrong part of the cartridge, missing the primer entirely and thus failing to fire. Even if it could fire, the higher pressure would likely destroy the rifle in short order.
</li><li> The .32 Caliber pistol and Hunting Rifle both use .32 caliber ammo, however the rifle is much more powerful than the pistol. The pistol is probably the weakest weapon in the game. This is because the Hunting Rifle is actually firing .308 projectiles, and someone accidentally set it to use the wrong ammo; even if it weren't a glitch, the long-barreled rifle with a sealed chamber would be able to fire the bullet with much more energy than the tiny, unsealed revolver anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> has several weapons which share ammo pools, some more sensibly than others. For instance, it's not too far out of the question that the 9mm SMG uses the same round as the 9mm pistol, but there's a few questions as to why a superheavy machine gun loads handgun rounds and two of the miniguns load revolver rounds. The most questionable universality in ammo might be that of the flame weapons: weapons that fire flamer fuel can somehow use this ammunition type to produce a flamethrower's flames, an incinerator's arcing fireballs, or most oddly, a flare gun's magnesium flare.
<ul><li> A high enough Science skill will allow you to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">workbenches</a> to convert the three main types of energy weapon ammunition between each other, effectively invoking this trope yourself. You can also transfer the energy in fission batteries to small energy cells (then covert them to whatever type you need)—which mysteriously creates five charged cells for every drained one the recipe requires.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> All firearms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura">Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura</a></em>, barring a few exotic examples, take the same bullets. Larger guns just shoot more than one at a time. Of course, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCrafting">Bullets schematic</a> only requires the ingredients for black powder, so it's unclear just what exactly you're shooting.
</li><li> On a larger scale in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline">EVE Online</a></em>, one unit of a certain "size" of projectile ammunition can be chambered in up to five calibers. For example, one unit of "Large projectile ammunition", meant to be fired from battleship guns, can be used interchangeably in Dual 425mm, 650mm, 800mm, 1200mm, and 1400mm guns. Also, a unit of ammunition unloaded from a 800mm autocannon takes up the volume as ammunition unloaded from a 1400mm howitzer.
</li><li> Averted in <em>7.62mm High Caliber</em>, with each gun taking the proper caliber and many calibers coming in multiple brands and types that can be mixed and matched in the magazines, and each gun takes its own magazine. One error is that the Mauser pistol and carbine take Tokarev ammo (which will load in a Mauser but are too powerful to safely use, and require 7.63mm Mauser ammunition instead).
</li><li> Played absurdly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Persona1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Persona1">Persona 1</a></em>, where your first ammo pickup is "9mm bullet" (followed by "12ga bullets" before moving on to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">"Tranquilizers", "Mage Killers"</a> and so on) which you can equip with any gun type, be it an SMG, a shotgun, or an assault rifle.

You won't have much luck firing an AK-74 with a magazine of M16 bullets. As noted, however, related firearms can take the same ammo (most assault rifles of Western origin in the series use the same magazines as the M16, for example).
<ul><li> <em>ARMA III</em> reverses this, as most weapons actually do take the same bullets as the equivalent weapons from the other factions (basic rifles taking 6.5mm for the major factions and 5.56mm for the indigenous forces, light pistols taking 9x21mm, heavy pistols .45 ACP), but use different, incompatible magazines (for the biggest example, FNP mags versus Rhino speedloaders for the .45 pistols) that can't be exchanged except by downloading a mod that lets you transfer ammo between mags; before an update alongside the <em>Contact</em> DLC in 2019, even different versions of the <em>same</em> weapon generally couldn't exchange mags, such as the inability to use the MXSW machine gun's hundred-round mags in the MXM marksman's rifle, and with mags that were compatible changing camo patterns to match the gun they're loaded in until the different colors were made separate with that update.

The same missile can be used to fire a usual rocket, a bigger rocket that can leave a nasty hull breach, a bomb that teleports straight inside the ship or a packet that instantly repairs one of your systems. The same drone part can be used to create a tiny bot that rides around your ship repairing systems, a scary tank-bot that flies towards your enemy to wreak havoc inside their ship, a tiny ship that constantly attacks the enemy ships with projectiles or a defence turret that shoots down incoming projectiles.

For those who don't know ammo, pistol ammo = bigger pistol ammo = shotgun shell = rifle ammo = smaller rifle ammo = grenade.
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ParasiteEve2">Parasite Eve 2</a></em>, each ammo type is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">Color-Coded for Your Convenience</a>. This even gets lampshaded by one of the NPCs, who notes that another character jammed a pistol by trying to force the ammo from a different pistol caliber into it.
</li></ul></li><li> The third game in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> series exchanges the previous games' "each gun has its own ammo type" system for this trope. Partially it was explained as a simplification for the new weapon crafting system, but the fandom reacted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a> (coupled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator">Lying Creator</a>, as the initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> was that this was only there for the demos).
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ObsCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ObsCure">ObsCure</a></em> game had pistol and shotgun ammunition used across all weapons in each category. It's justified for the shotguns, which are all presumably 12-gauge, but the pistol ammo is used in everything from the old pocket pistol you find early on to the custom heavy pistol you take from the principal's safe to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Hand Cannon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolversAreJustBetter">magnum revolver</a>, which all vary widely in power. The second game averts it, with each gun using different ammunition, but the spinoff <em>Final Exam</em> goes even further and has all guns, from the pistol to the rocket launcher, use the same generic ammo.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSector">darkSector</a></em> this is played pretty much straight with everything but the starting pistol, which only shares ammo with its own burst-firing upgrade; the Klin PP9 (9x18mm), AKS-74U (5.45x39mm) and G36C (5.56x45mm) all share an ammo pool, as do the Webley Mark IV revolver (9x20mm rimmed) and the SOCOM 16 rifle (7.62x51mm NATO).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider2013">Tomb Raider</a></em>. Each of Lara's weapons (bow, handgun, shotgun and rifle) use a different type of ammunition. However, <em>all</em> upgrades use their same respective ammunition, regardless of what stage you have them upgraded to. This is justified with the bow and shotgun, which don't change to forms that use completely different ammo, but is played ridiculously straight with the pistol and rifle, which <em>do</em>: Lara replaces her Beretta 92 (9x19mm Parabellum) with an M1911 (.45 ACP) and then somehow upgrades that M1911 into a Desert Eagle (.50 Action Express), while the rifle starts as a Type 100 (8x22mm Nambu) and is eventually turned into an AK-47 (7.62x39mm Soviet) and then some strange combination of it and an Ultimax 100 Mark 3 (5.56x45mm NATO). She also uses the same grenades for the rifle's grenade launcher to create "grenade arrows" (though that one is arguably justified). Also, all previous modifications (padded stocks, port-vented slides, etc.) automatically carry over when Lara upgrades her weapons - even in the above case of replacing her Beretta with the 1911 rather than upgrading it into one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em>, each of its 21 firearms are in one of 6 categories: Revolvers, Pistols, Rifles, Repeaters, Sniper Rifles, and Shotguns. Each category has an associated ammunition type (i.e. shotgun ammo for shotguns) which is universal across all weapons in the category.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em>: Ammo, for the most part, is totally interchangeable within any weapon of a certain classification. This leads to the 5.7x28mm Five-seven firing the same 9x19mm Parabellum as Leon's custom "Silver Ghost" and the C96. Furthermore, the magazines are the same size for each gun, but the ammo cap for each gun can be upgraded. Is Leon putting two mags in on top of each other?
<ul><li> Inverted in the case of the TMP as compared to the handguns. An actual Steyr TMP fires standard 9x19mm Parabellum rounds, the same as what the ammo pickups for the handguns identifies them as firing, but the in-game TMP uses its own rounds separate from those for the handguns. This is justified with the series' catch-all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> that the rounds for your TMP are "custom".
</li></ul></li><li> Inconsistently applied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SniperEliteV2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SniperEliteV2">Sniper Elite V2</a></em>, where you can search the corpses of enemies to get ammo, but each weapon has its own ammo pool and SMG ammo is almost never found in this manner. You can typically find American .30-06 or Russian 7.62x54mmR rifle rounds on a dead German who was armed with an MP 40, but you can't find 9x19mm rounds for that very same MP 40 of his if you decide to take it. Or, worse, you <em>can</em>, but they'll be only usable in the Welrod or Luger pistol instead. This gets even worse with weapons added through DLC, where that same dead German may now have British .303 or even <em>Japanese 7.7x58mm rounds</em> on him for some reason. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SniperElite3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SniperElite3">Sniper Elite 3</a></em> uses the same mechanics, though with the addition of loose ammo pickups that replenish weapons based on their class, looting rules changed to prioritize SMG ammo over handguns, and the ability to grab ammo from copies of the same weapon dropped by enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>: There are four ammo types — pistol, rifle, shotgun, and sniper — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">Color-Coded for Your Convenience</a>. How universal is it? All sidearms/secondaries share the 'pistol' ammo type. Aside from actual pistols this category also includes shotgun pistols, SMGs, throwing knives, crossbows, laser guns, handheld rocket launchers, small flame throwers, remotely detonated sticky bombs, and <em>bits of mutated flesh that burst open on impact to release toxic gas</em>. A Grineer Assault Rifle and Corpus Plasma Rifle can even run off the same rifle ammo pack. Despite the fact one shoots bullets and the other shoots <em>plasma bolts</em>.
<ul><li> And then there are "ammo mutation" mods, that, when equipped on a weapon, can convert any ammunition pickup into the relevant ammunition, so you get sniper/bow ammo from pistol/shotgun/rifle ammo pickups, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">Attack Drone</a> designed to act as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCaddy">Item Caddy</a> that can do the same for <strong>all</strong> your weapons.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaggedAlliance">Jagged Alliance</a> 2</em> all 7.62mm calibre weapons of WarPac/ChiCom origin use the same ammunition - 7.62mm, which would be logical, except there are three kinds of 7.62mm Warsaw Pact ammunition in real life: 7.62x54mmR, as used by the Dragunov and most of their MGs, 7.62x39mm as used by the AK-47/AKM and their relatives, and 7.62x25 used by the PPSh/Type 65 and other pistol type weapons. They are definitely NOT interchangeable; the second numbers denote case length, which means the first one would be more than twice the size of the chamber for the last. This was eventually fixed in the v1.13 modification.
</li><li> While normally being pretty faithful to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> weaponry, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentStorm">Silent Storm</a></em> does have a few odd-balls. For example, some submachine guns can be reloaded by equivalent bullets used by machine guns (submachine gun mags take up 2 vertical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GridInventory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GridInventory">Grid Inventory</a> squares, while machine gun clips take up 4). One has to wonder how a large circular magazine fits into the normal-sized mag housing. The same is also true for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyWeapons">Energy Weapons</a> that become available late in the game. The handheld versions are bazooka-sized, but there are also energy-armed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Panzerkleins</a>. All the mags for these are large (4 squares) but carry only a charge for a single shot. However, an extremely-rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounter</a> can result in you getting your hands on an energy assault rifle, which uses rifle-sized magazines (1 square) with 50 shots in each. Once you give the rifle to the quartermaster as the base, you can get unlimited 50-shot mags that also work with any energy weapon. So, instead of lugging around huge canisters that only offer you a single shot, you can carry 4 mags for 200 shots in the same space.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aurora4X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aurora4X">Aurora</a></em> when it comes to missiles. Every launcher can launch missiles equal to and smaller than the size of the launcher, but there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a> potential to encourage using the missiles they're made for. For instance, smaller launchers are quicker to reload, fire control designed for one type of missile will lose much of its efficiency if used for launching smaller ones (fighter fire controls tend to be poor resolution and small size so they are much shorter-ranged than escort/capital ships, and that could mean the difference between pounding enemy from a safe distance or entering the range of his own anti-ship missiles).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GirlsFrontline">Girls Frontline</a></em> makes ammo management an important part of battle, but has it all as a simple, generic resource that all of your Tactical Dolls draw from when they resupply. You can have an echelon made up of girls using weapons with diverse and unique ammo types like a Nagant M1895 (7.62x38mmR), CBJ-MS (6.5x25mm), AAC Honey Badger (7.62x35mm), H&amp;K G11 (4.73x33mm), and LWMMG (8.6x63mm), and they can all simply deduct a certain amount from your total ammo supply to fight with, with the only difference being exactly how much they each carry at once. That's also not getting into the fact that ammo as a resource is also used in the <em>production</em> of T-Dolls, despite the fact that there's no reason for any to be used until you actually have them and send them into battle.

The same bullets do different things, from explode to multiply, based on which gun they are loaded into, and can appear in a wide variety of clips (especially in <em>2</em>), from energy cells for Maliwan or Hyperion sniper rifles to chunky wheels full of bullets for Jakobs ones. Each Vault Hunter carries a storage deck that can deconstruct, store, and reconstruct all of their guns, ammo, relics, etc; it isn't much of a stretch to think that it can create new custom ammo. This is explicitly the case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowAwayGuns">Tediore guns</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> onward; they explode and are reconstructed with full ammo rather than reloaded.
<ul><li> Salvador's class ability allows him to dual-wield guns and regenerate health and ammo. Naturally his class mod is a second storage deck.

Their anti-tank laser cannon however, requires a much larger battery pack. Almost all handheld projectile rifles and pistols are chambered in 9mm ammo, bar sniper rifles, allowing a Terran Republic soldier behind enemy lines to reload his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">Mini Chaingun</a> with ammo looted from New Conglomerate Gauss Rifles, for example.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExInvisibleWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExInvisibleWar">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a></em> takes this trope to the extreme. Anything that uses ammunition uses <em>the same ammunition</em> as everything else. The in-game explanation is that ammunition is reduced to a slurry of nanomachines that form into the proper ammunition for the weapon. This includes battery packs, flame thrower fuel, regular bullets, and even <strong>rockets</strong>. The creative reason behind this is that the inventory system got simplified, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">carrying 20 types of ammo didn't sound appealing when you only had 7 spaces</a>. This has the major drawback of burning your ammo with one gun, or even doing too much shooting late in the game means you're screwed, since you can still only carry about as much ammo as you could in the first game but that limited supply is stretched across four or five guns now.
<ul><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">the first game</a>, and wasn't an issue because ammo was stored in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceArsenal">Hyperspace Arsenal</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassLongcoat">your coat</a>) separate from the normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GridInventory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GridInventory">Grid Inventory</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlakeStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlakeStone">Blake Stone</a></em> games have all the weapons using the same ammo. Justified in that all the weapons are energy-based and the ammo is energy packs. Just don't go too crazy with the more ammo-hungry guns that you have to resort to using your emergency self-charging pistol.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> series: the first two games had four types of ammunition for six guns (seven if you include the second game's super shotgun). The Plasma Gun and BFG share ammo, as do the aforementioned super shotgun and the original shotgun, which are both justified as the former two are both energy weapons powered by battery packs and the latter two are fed with loose shells, is justified. The pistol and chaingun also share ammunition, which is less justified. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom3">Doom 3</a></em> averts the trope entirely, as excluding the double-barrel shotgun added in <em>Resurrection of Evil</em>, which shares ammo with the base shotgun, every weapon has its own unique ammo supply - even the pistol, submachine gun and chaingun which all fire bullets but have their own supplies. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a></em> goes back to the style of the first two games, using four ammo types for seven guns and two special ammo types for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainsawGood">special</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">weapons</a>.

<ul><li> <em>Wolf3D</em> in particular only had three guns, two of which were based on real guns (the P08 or P38 pistol, depending on the system, and MP40 SMG) that do both use 9mm cartridges, though not from the same magazines - the minigun shares ammo with them too, but then again it <em>is</em> fictional. Later ports of the game add a rocket launcher and flamethrower weapon, each of which use separate ammo types from each other and the regular guns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReturnToCastleWolfenstein">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a></em> has more ammo types, but is still careful to only let those guns that actually used them share - the returning Luger and MP40 all use 9mm Parabellum rounds, as does the British Sten, while also adding .45 ACP rounds for the Colt 1911 and Thompson SMG, and 7.92mm Mauser rounds for the Mauser rifle and FG 42. Other guns, like the Panzerfaust, flamethrower, tesla cannon and Snooper Rifle, each have their own ammo types, and you're not going to be pilfering more for them from the corpses of your enemies unless you stole the gun from one in the first place. Interestingly, the Venom gun has its own unique ammo supply, which is justified but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">two entirely-incompatible ways</a> - the in-game operations manual you can find before you get it states that it uses a specific variety of 7.92mm ammo that the Mauser and FG 42 presumably are not using, but its ammo pickups are identified as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">12.7mm (i.e. .50-caliber)</a> when you grab them.

There are still some oddities, though, such as the Desert Eagle sharing the same ammo as the other two handguns (no .45 ACP version of the Desert Eagle exists in reality), and none of the grenade launchers share ammo (realistic in the case of the XM29's 20mm grenades, but the M203 and Hawk both use the same 40mm ones in real life).

There are also a few weapons that cannot be reloaded from the ammo piles but can get explosive or incendiary ammo, specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">the grenade launcher and M60</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a> Hunters</em> have actual nanotech-based Universal Ammo that fits all of your special weapons. Only the missile launcher uses different ammo. Since all the guns are at least partially energy weapons, it's a bit more believable, though, as the ammo itself probably doesn't need to shape itself to extreme tolerances - even for the explosive Battlehammer, "close enough" will do, allowing a quick configuration to be at least somewhat plausible.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Role-Playing Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, ammunition is nothing more than a metal block that gets shaved into the proper form which for the sake of gameplay is as-good-as-unlimited, with rate of fire being limited by the weapon's heat sink. The block in a standard assault rifle is about 5,000 shots, which is more than enough to fight a war, and with field tools a new block can be swapped into place in a matter of minutes. In Wrex's backstory, he once fought a duel in which he ran out of ammo and had to take a gun from a merc he'd killed earlier, but only after the duel had gone on for three <em>days</em>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> kept the unlimited ammunition, but added "thermal clips" that absorb heat from the weapon and eventually need to be discarded. Essentially, they act just like ammunition. The clips are universal - pick one up and it adds more total shots to all of your weapons. However, the game does feature a more straight example of the trope with the Heavy Weapons, which do use traditional ammo... the same ammo, whether the weapon is a rocket launcher, an experimental BFG, or an <em>alien energy weapon built from technology beyond what anyone else has</em>. That this "ammo" is actually a high-density power cell doesn't explain either its universal compatibility or the weapons' ability to form complicated projectiles from that raw energy - though it may be that, like standard mass effect weapons, at least the second point is rendered moot by the weapon typically having more than enough ammunition to go through a full load of energy dozens of times, and being serviced on return to the <em>Normandy</em>. Also, Shepard can run out of thermal clips for one weapon, yet still have plenty of shots left in the others, which is inconsistent with said ammunition being universal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> allows weapons to share ammo, with differences in damage dealt per shot by them often depending more on what type of ammo is loaded into them rather than the weapon itself; overpressure ammunition (or overcharged/max charge energy cells and microfusion cells) deal greater damage and have better armor penetration. It's not even usually a clear choice, either, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">Breakable Weapons</a> is in effect and the most common ammo that deals more damage tends to be surplus bullets that degrade your weapons faster. Likewise, there are low power versions of cartridges (like .223 for 5.56mm weapons or .38 and .44 Special for .357 and .44 Magnum, respectively) that deal less damage but cause less degradation. There are even special hand loaded, match grade rounds and bullets like wadcutters or jacketed soft points that deal extra damage and have better armor penetration without degrading the weapon, and rounds that deal better damage (hollow points) or have better penetration (AP) while doing less of the other type of damage. Simply put, there's such a huge variety of ammunition that the game had to include <em>reloading benches</em> to let players reload their ammo with powder, lead, and primers (either purchased from vendors or taken from broken down ammo that you don't need to use) or build their preferred loads. A major part of the modding scene for <em>New Vegas</em> is adding more ammunition types and expanding the reloading aspect to ensure that everyone can make whatever they want.
<ul><li> <em>New Vegas</em> also inverts this with shotguns for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfWeaponEffectiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfWeaponEffectiveness">Sorting Algorithm of Weapon Effectiveness</a>: most common, early-game shotguns use 20-gauge shells instead of 12-gauge, even though only one of the three shotguns' real life bases was available in 20-gauge.
</li><li> With the <em>Gun Runners' Arsenal</em> DLC installed, the intercompatibility of ammo types makes some more sense. .223 and 5.56 NATO cartridges are just slightly different versions of the same cartridge, while weapons like That Gun and the Service Rifle are chambered for the same NATO cartridge. You can also, as in the Real Life examples below, create Overpressure cartridges that have significantly greater muzzle velocity, but damage the barrel more when fired. Some specific weapons, like the .50 Rifle and the various 5.56 NATO guns, can even have special Match ammo made for them, which uses greater numbers of crafting ingredients to produce ammo, that in turn does less damage to the barrel and has greater accuracy, reflecting the wide variety of grades for powder and primer in real life. Esoteric ammo like Dragon's Breath rounds and Coin Shot for the 12-gauge shotguns also tend to do more damage to the barrel of the gun, for increased realism.
</li><li> Most (though not all) small energy cell, microfusion cell, and electron charge pack-using weapons justify the universality by not strictly using the cells as <em>ammunition</em> — being energy weapons, the cells only provide the energy to power the attack, which makes it a great deal easier to universalize things and simplify logistics to just one of three types of ammunition. Much like ammo above, the player is also able to recycle used cells, convert one type to another, and buy or produce low-charged "bulk" cells (which reduce damage but also weapon degradation) or overcharged ones (which increase damage and degradation instead).

So long as they were rimmed cartridges, this would be entirely possible; revolvers will generally shoot anything you can fit into their cylinders. Also, the two scoped rifles, the Springfield M1903 and the H&amp;K SL8, share ammo despite the fact that the real weapons are designed for respectively .30-06 Springfield and .223 Remington; however, if you read the inventory description for the Springfield, it does flat-out state the gun in question has been rechambered for .223.

Claire now gets two revolvers, her first one being a Smith &amp; Wesson Bodyguard in .38 Special that actually could, at least in theory, take 9mm Para rounds like Leon's VP70. Her second, replacing the SAA as her bonus weapon in a B scenario, is a Ruger Blackhawk, which gets its own unique ammo type that is only shared with Leon's equivalent bonus weapon, an M1911.

Every other ammo type is identified by the weapon it matches; even two of the other guns that do share ammo in real life load it from entirely different magazines that the other could not possibly use.

Every gun takes unique ammunition and picking up a gun will only give ammo if you have a copy of that gun in your inventory. However, the vast majority of your ammunition comes from generic containers loaded with a random amount of ammo for some or all of the guns you have. These containers will only ever contain ammo for the guns in your inventory, so the game (in practice, if not in form) has a sort of universal ammunition pickup.

The pistols don't share ammunition with one another, being that one fires a bigger bullet than the others, and another presumably uses lower-velocity ammo to complement its suppressor; the SMGs and shotguns can take ammo from other weapons in their class, since they do fire the same bullets as one another in real life (respectively 9mm and 12-gauge). However, the 7.62x39mm AK-47 and 5.56x45mm M4 also share ammo.

No matter where or when in the competing Successor States the weapon and ammunition were manufactured, as long as their general type matches it'll fit; AC/5 ammo will work in any AC/5 ever built, never mind that those can canonically come in different <em>calibers</em>. The weapons and feeding systems are even flexible enough to handle special-purpose ammunition that is canonically sufficiently heavier than normal to halve the number of shots! Yet on the other hand, the 'general type' match must be <em>strict</em> — no shooting standard shells from a more advanced (say, LB-X or ultra) autocannon of the same size or vice versa, no feeding missiles from an LRM-15 bin into an LRM-5 rack despite the fact that both get 120 identical missiles to the ton and feeding launchers of the <em>same</em> size from any matching magazine mounted somewhere on your unit is A-OK.

Played more straight in <em>Ultra-Tech</em> where there are only a dozen different rounds between all the guns. <em>High Tech</em> even has a table explaining ammo compatibility (including showing how less powerful and/or smaller parent cartridges fit into their descendant guns, like .38 Special into .357 Magnum, but not vice-versa), and optional rules that let the GM determine the effect of loading incompatible ammo that somehow fits in the gun (with the best result being lower efficiency and possible jamming, and the worst result being the gun exploding).
</li><li> An odd version in the <em>Wasteland</em> RPG. Ammo calibers were standardized (.45, 9mm, 7.62x39mm, and energy), but the clips themselves were 'universal'—a rifle ammo clip could fit in any rifle. Their capacity was determined only by the weapon they were loaded in: the same clip that put 7 rounds in a .45 pistol gave 30 to a submachine gun.

<ul><li> Of course, darts come in a variety of diameters, which obviously won't fit smaller weapons. This is mostly an issue for Bows, the Titan rocket launcher, the Elite Demolisher's underbarrel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">grenade launcher</a>, and blasters that use either ball ammo or the older Mega Darts.
</li><li> Modern post-2000s blasters tend to use several common shared ammo types:
<ul><li> All N-strike and N-Strike Elite blasters that use the Clip System magazines share the common Streamline Micro Dart as well as the new Elite Streamline and Elite Suction-cup Darts.
</li><li> All muzzle-loading blasters and a number of non-CS blasters can share the Sonic Micro/Whistler micro darts or the Suction Cup micro darts. Most of them can also share the Tagger micro darts with Dart Tag blasters.
</li><li> Several revolver blasters, like the Maverick, Spectre, and Strongarm, are all able to use <em>any</em> Micro Dart due to the short dart posts in their chambers.
</li><li> All Vortex Blasters share the XLR disc ammo.
</li><li> Elite Blasters can <em>all</em> use the streamlined Elite Micro Darts, and mostly retain backwards compatibility with the older N-Strike Streamline Micro Darts. The Rebelle and Zombie Strike series blasters also use the same base ammo type. The only exceptions are the Elite MEGA blasters, all of which can use MEGA Elite Darts but not the smaller Elite Micros, some of the Rebelle bows that use unique arrows, some Zombie Strike blasters that are chambered for XLR Disc ammo, and the Elite Demolisher's underbarrel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrenadeLauncher">Grenade Launcher</a>, which takes unique "Mega Dart Tech" grenades.
</li><li> N-Strike, N-Strike Elite, Zombie Strike, Rebelle, and Doomlands blasters that use Clip System Magazines can all swap magazines, for the most part. Yes, this means you can use your drum magazines from your old Raider with most other Clip System blasters.
</li><li> The Rival series blasters all use the same kind of ball ammo, and the ones that have magazines all use the same form factor so you can fit a 25-ball mag into an Apollo or Zeus blaster.
</li></ul></li><li> All BOOMco (competing brand by Mattel) blasters use the same "smart dart" design, where the body is light, flexible plastic with a spongey rubber tip.
</li><li> Some Buzz-Bee darts, especially more recent ones (2012 on) use the same diameter as official Nerf darts, allowing the ammo to be swapped between them. However, Buzz-Bee makes almost exclusively suction darts, so only Nerf blasters that can use Micro Darts (like the Maverick or Barricade) can use them. Note that they aren't entirely identical, and Nerf blasters with longer dart pegs will have shortened range.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder23');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder23" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for armies of the world. The less kinds of ammo you have to stock and distribute, the easier it is to supply your troops. Imagine the logistics nightmare during World War II for the U.S., when any one squad needed .30-06 (M1 Garand, M1903 Springfield, and various machine guns), .45 ACP (M1 Thompson, M3 Grease Gun, and M1911), and/or .30 carbine (M1 Carbine). Compared to today where a squad usually only needs one caliber: 5.56mm.
<ul><li> As mentioned in the opening of the page, NATO's draft standardization agreement 4179 decreed that all NATO weapons chambered for 5.56x45mm were to be designed to take the same magazines as the American M16. Note though that this agreement was never actually ratified, and a good chunk of the NATO members who <em>do</em> use weapons that take STANAG magazines also tend to go the extra mile and use direct derivatives of the AR-15, most commonly the Colt Canada C7 and C8 or Heckler &amp; Koch's HK416; rarely someone will use another weapon that isn't expressly designed for them but can take them anyway, like Fabrique Nationale's FNC, which is designed to use magazines which are almost identical to STANAG ones and can be interchanged with little issue. Some NATO members like France and Germany do make STANAG-compliant versions of, or adapters for, their standard-issue weapons, but they're far more commonly used with proprietary ones.
</li><li> One of the major reasons for the controversial U.S. Army replacement of the Colt M1911 pistol with the Beretta M9 in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> was so that NATO armed forces would only need to stock one type of pistol-caliber ammunition (the M1911 was chambered for .45 while pretty much everyone else was using sidearms chambered for 9mm).
</li><li> As of 2017, the main service pistols of the world's three largest armies are chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. America's SIG M17, China's QSZ-92-9 (5.8mm variant was not adopted), and Russia's MP-443 Grach. With the majority of both NATO and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ShanghaiCooperationOrganisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ShanghaiCooperationOrganisation">SCO</a> armies using the 9mm, it has become <em>the</em> universal pistol caliber.
</li><li> The Luger P08 had already cemented its cartridge's status as such as early as 1918, with the Bergmann MP18 submachine gun initially designed to load rounds from its famous 32-round "snail drum" magazines.
</li><li> The NATO 5.56x45mm service rifle munition is based on the .223 Remington round. Though mostly the same in form factor, the NATO-standardized version has a higher chamber pressure. Some older guns that were stated to be chambered for .223 could be damaged by firing 5.56mm, but most current-manufactured civilian firearms chambered for .223 have been idiot-proofed against such damage. The inverse issue is true for the NATO 7.62x51mm battle rifle round and its parent munition in .308 Winchester - owing to the kinds of big game .308 rifles are meant to hunt, the 7.62mm NATO round actually has a <em>lower</em> chamber pressure than .308, so civilian rifles don't need any such idiot-proofing.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in real life. While ammo will work in any gun chambered for it, magazine designs are quite often incompatible. Many civilian gun manufacturers produce proprietary magazines, which would be the only magazines that could work with their firearms. Fortunately, due to the explosion of aftermarket magazines, as well as of the third-party <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunAccessories">Gun Accessories</a> industry in general, this practice has become much less pervasive over the past 10 years, but especially since the expiration of the Clinton-era AWB in 2004. This phenomenon is partially due to the fact that gun buyers now more frequently go after a generic platform of firearm (such as Kalashnikov, AR-15, M1911, etc.), made by several different companies, rather than buy a brand-exclusive gun. Smaller gun companies also tend to make a significant portion of their profits from aftermarket magazine and parts sales, and it is cheaper for such companies to build guns which will work with common magazines for brand name guns. It's pretty much like between buying Ibuprofen or buying Motrin, but making your decision based on the container rather than the contents.
<ul><li> Ruger infamously limited its sales of magazines bigger than 5 rounds exclusively to law enforcement in the 1990s after a terrible school shooting in Stockton, CA in 1989. As a result, many small fortunes have been made creating third-party magazines for Ruger firearms. It should be noted that standard magazine capacity for two-handed weapons is anywhere between 10 to 30 rounds, depending on caliber, and even state laws restricting the maximum capacity of a weapon in civilian hands never limit it to less than 10. The Ruger company abandoned these restrictions in the mid-2000s after Bill Ruger died in 2002 (he had been the one to personally halt the sales of &gt;5-round magazines) and the Bill Clinton-era Assault Weapons Ban expired in September 2004.
</li><li> Glock magazines are particularly noteworthy for this - not only can different versions of it in one caliber exchange magazines, within reason (there's a minimum size of magazine any one Glock can take depending on frame size; a Glock 26 can take the 17-round magazines of the Glock 17, but the 17 wouldn't be able to load the shorter 10-rounders of the Glock 26), but the sheer ubiquity of the Glock (including there being versions of it, and a wide variety of magazine sizes for it, in essentially every pistol cartridge currently produced) means that several modern submachine guns and pistol-caliber carbines are also designed to take Glock mags, such as the Kriss Vector and the Ruger PC Carbine. Starting in the latter half of the 2010s, a veritable cottage industry has sprung up for AR-15 variants that are designed to fire pistol calibers using Glock mags such as the Just Right Carbine, the Palmetto State Armory AR-9, and the TNW Aero Survival Rifle.
</li></ul></li><li> The Colt Single Action Army Revolver or "Peacemaker" was available in .44-40 Winchester, which made its ammunition interchangeable with the Winchester Model 1873 lever action rifle. A useful trait in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWest">Wild West</a>, and what started the trend of carrying a carbine and sidearm in the same caliber so that you only had to carry a supply of one cartridge. In fact, in spite of the fame of the SAA's .45 Colt version, the .44-40 was the most popular civilian cartridge for revolvers in general in that era, for exactly that reason. A less common but still popular choice was the .38-40 Winchester, which traded slightly less power for reduced recoil and was also available in both the Winchester 1873 rifle and the Single Action Army.
</li><li> Fabrique Nationale's P90 Personal Defense Weapon and Five-seveN pistol share the same ammo, the 5.7x28mm cartridge, expressly designed for both guns. The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-57">AR-57<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> goes one step further - it is an upper receiver for AR-15 rifles that can be used to make them fire 5.7mm bullets, loading them from the exact same magazines designed for the P90 and even ejecting the same way the P90 does (dumping empties through the existing AR-15 magazine well).
<ul><li> The P90/Five-seveN is the most well-known example (and one of the few surviving ones) of the PDW fad that lasted from about 1985 to 2005, where firearm manufacturers were trying to win government and private security contracts by manufacturing submachine guns that used small, high-velocity rounds that could penetrate lighter body armor and were accompanied by a handgun chambered for the same round. Its biggest competitor, the German H&amp;K MP7 (chambered for a 4.6x30mm round), wound up having its handgun counterpart, the H&amp;K UCP, scrapped after nearly 5 years of delays due to poor ballistics. The MP7 is a perfect example of a gun that was meant to use this trope and ended up being a near-perfect aversion of it (several other companies now make PDWs that can be special-ordered in or converted to 4.6mm, but it took close to a decade for it to happen). The fact that the MP7 is itself basically a pistol (albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">a very large one</a>) that can be holstered on a soldier's belt and can easily be fired one-handed when in semi-auto mode helped with H&amp;K deeming the UCP to be redundant.
</li><li> Back on the subject of FN, their F2000 assault rifle is an inversion, not in the ammo itself but in its magazines. Its magazine well is incredibly deep, including a gasket to keep dust and dirt out when a mag is loaded. The downside to this is that magazines have to be of the same relative design as those used by the US military, i.e. flat-sided with at best inward grooves - ones with outward bulges, like a PMAG, won't fit into an F2000.
</li></ul></li><li> In general, submachine guns are issued in the service pistol caliber of the nation in question. This is usually 9x19mm Parabellum or .45 ACP, with the former as mentioned above having become the nearly universal pistol caliber worldwide.
</li><li> Likewise, while there have been several different sizes of shotgun shell, today 12-gauge is <em>the</em> most common. 20-gauge and .410 bore are second- and third-place, but in this day and age, 12-gauge shotguns for specific <em>sizes</em> of 12-gauge shells (e.g. whether your shotgun can load shells that are three inches long or will only take ones that are two and three-quarter-inches long) seem more common than they are. Other previously-popular shells like 10-, 16-, or 28-gauge are all but forgotten nowadays.
</li><li> Similarly, there are different sizes of pellets for air guns, but the most common ones are 6mm for airsoft and 4.5mm for regular air guns. That said, even among these there's still room for an inability to exchange ammo; for instance, some airsoft weapons are specifically designed for lighter 0.12g pellets, while others may require 0.20g or heavier to work properly, while a .177-caliber air gun might end up shattering a plastic 4.5mm pellet just from trying to fire it. On top of that, magazines are inconsistently interchangeable - one could have two or more airsoft versions of the same pistol but be unable to exchange magazines if they're made by different companies, but then load the magazine from one into a completely different pistol made by the same company. Meanwhile, some magazines are stated as compatible but require some form of modification (like wrapping duct tape around them) to get them to fit properly.
</li><li> One of the main advantages to the .22 Long and its variations was that a rifle fitted for one caliber could take any that had a shorter casing<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4mhgm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4mhgm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4mhgm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this even means that weapons chambered for the long-obsolete .22 Extra Long (discontinued in 1935) can still be fired, as the still-produced .22LR will work just fine with them</span>. A few other calibers, such as the .38 or the aforementioned 12-gauge, also did this. This only works with rimmed cartridges though, with <em>very</em> rare exceptions.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note59178');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note59178" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note59178');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">e.g. Smith &amp; Wesson's variation of the M1917 revolver, to supplement the M1911 pistol in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, was specifically designed to be able to take regular .45 ACP cartridges without use of a moon clip, while Colt's version of the same weapon required either a moon clip to hold .45 ACP, or a special .45 Auto Rim version of the ammo; though this in turn meant reloading S&amp;W's version with regular .45 ammo required shaking the casings loose manually, since there's no rim or clip for the ejector to catch onto.</span>
<ul><li> A revolver chambered for .357 Magnum<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6l31c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6l31c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6l31c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">dimensions: .379 x 1.59 inches</span> can safely use .38 Special<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7frnn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7frnn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7frnn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">dimensions: .379 x 1.55 inches. The slugs in both are ⌀.357</span> or +P rounds. They're the same diameter, but the .357 case is slightly longer, so it cannot be used in a .38 weapon for safety reasons. Likewise, the .44 Magnum and .44 Special. And the .45 Long Colt and its lengthened and more powerful brothers, the .454 Casull and .460 S&amp;W Magnum. Some modern revolvers are also sold with a second cylinder meant for an automatic pistol cartridge of the same diameter, e.g. a .357 Magnum revolver (9x33mmR) coming with a cylinder for 9x19mm. As a general rule with revolvers: if it fits in the hole, then it's OK. Automatics firing revolver rounds are generally okay, as well, though there are more factors to take into consideration, including the strength of the recoil springs (generally requiring swapping between weaker and stronger springs for respectively Special and Magnum loads; stronger means weaker cartridges won't be able to push the slide back far enough to cycle properly, while weaker means full-power cartridges can outright damage the gun).
</li><li> This sort of thinking was the reason why nearly all Soviet small arms from at least 1891 to about 1951 fired 7.62mm bullets - even though they had different such cartridges<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note82uby');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note82uby" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note82uby');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">7.62x54mmR for rifles and machine guns, 7.62x25mm for pistols and SMGs, and later the intermediate 7.62x39mm</span>, if they ran critically short of barrels for <em>anything</em> during wartime production, they could take old Tsarist-era Mosin-Nagant rifles and recycle their barrels for use in other guns. For example, one of the old 31.5 inch barrels from the original Mosin-Nagant long rifle could be cut down into <em>3</em> PPS-43 submachine gun barrels. And early production PPSh-41 SMGs were made by taking 29 inch barrels originally intended for the M91/30 Mosin-Nagant and cutting them in half, then trimming the halves down to the proper length.
</li><li> AK-pattern rifles may have honorary status for this trope; in addition to the original 7.62 and 5.45mm bullets for the AK-47/AKM and AK-74, the weapon's action has also been adapted or copied for 9x18mm, 9x19mm, 5.56x45mm, 7.62x51mm, and even 12- and 20-gauge, among various other one-off calibers for specific military purposes. The modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RareGuns/AssaultRifles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RareGuns/AssaultRifles">AK-12</a>, around 2013, was being advertised for its adaptability, able to swap between various Russian and NATO calibers (including most of the listed ones just above) with little more than a barrel and magazine change; as of it entering production, this doesn't appear to be the case, though there are still separate variants of the weapon for different calibers as before (the AK-12 in 5.45mm, an AK-15 in 7.62mm Soviet, and an AK-308 for foreign customers in .308 Winchester).
</li><li> One of the ways in which Heckler &amp; Koch's UMP <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CoolGuns/SubmachineGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CoolGuns/SubmachineGuns">submachine gun</a> was meant to be a modern upgrade to the MP5 was that it was expressly designed to be easily converted from one caliber to another (as opposed to the MP5 being chiefly a 9mm weapon, with alternate calibers requiring entirely separate variants like the MP5/10) - all that's required is a swap of the bolt, barrel, and magazine, the mags being designed to all fit into one universal magwell.
</li><li> The Mark XIX version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Desert Eagle</a> is much the same: Switch out the barrel and magazine of a .50AE version for a .357 Magnum one and you can switch ammo. You don't even need to switch the bolt assembly between .50 and .44 Magnum, because the former has the same rim diameter as .44. Unlike the UMP, however, since you're probably never going to use a Desert Eagle in a real gunfight, there's little point in doing so other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">being tired of paying a dollar per round for .50AE</a>.
</li><li> Similar ideas have also fueled the creation of some more modern rounds, like the 6.5x25mm CBJ or .300 AAC Blackout, which are designed to be as compatible as possible with their parent cartridges, respectively 9mm Para and 5.56mm NATO. The new rounds are essentially the existing casings simply necked differently to take a different-diameter bullet, requiring nothing more than a barrel change to convert an existing 9mm or 5.56mm weapon to 6.5 or .300 - the actual casing is the same size, so they will still fit in the same magazines and still work with the same bolts.
</li></ul></li><li> Another fact to consider is that while two guns may be chambered in the same cartridge, they may be optimized for or work better with different loads of said cartridge, due to their construction or rifling. A major part of owning a gun is determining the right load or ammo manufacturer for optimum accuracy.
<ul><li> For example, the American M16A4 and the French FAMAS F1 are both chambered in 5.56x45mm. However, the FAMAS has a 1:12 rifling twist rate, which is designed to be used with the M193 55-grain cartridge, while the M16A2 has a 1:7 twist rate optimized for use with the heavier SS109/M855 62-grain cartridge; moreover, the FAMAS' operation (a stronger lever-delayed blowback system) means standard brass casings are liable to rupture when used in the weapon, requiring steel-cased rounds for the best results. The FAMAS <em>can</em> properly chamber and fire the newer 62-grain round, but the rifling will not stabilize it properly, resulting in poor accuracy. The G2 variant of the FAMAS has a 1:9 twist rate, which could properly stabilize both 55 and 62-grain rounds, but was not widely adopted.
</li><li> Some rounds are available with more powerful propellant loads, known as overpressure or +P or +P+ loads. It is entirely possible to load up a .38 Special revolver with overloaded .38 Special ammunition that will blow the gun apart (in your hand, no less) if the particular gun is not designed to handle that propellant load. This is most common with older 9mm handguns (modern 9mm cartridges are more powerful than they had been a hundred years ago due to improved gun metallurgy) and rifles in .223 Remington or 7.62x51mm NATO, as mentioned up above (respectively, the military 5.56mm and the civilian .308 rounds have the exact same dimensions, but have a higher propellant load).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9nbea');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9nbea" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9nbea');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As an interesting tidbit, the original 9mm handgun, the Luger, had gained a reputation among US soldiers who had stolen them from dead Germans during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReliablyUnreliableGuns">being unreliable</a> due to the opposite problem - American ammo companies had produced 9mm bullets with less-powerful loads than normal in an attempt to prevent the soldiers from accidentally blowing up their war trophies, but in some cases the rounds weren't even powerful enough to properly work its mechanism.</span>
</li><li> Likewise, some rounds are also available in reduced-velocity loads with heavier bullets, designed for reduced noise and recoil, or, in the case of subsonic loads, with suppressors. These rounds may chamber in weapons designed for the caliber, but their reduced velocity may not properly cycle an automatic action.
</li><li> Imperial Japan managed to pull this off with their own standard infantry weapons. The Type 38 Arisaka rifle and Type 11 light machine gun were both chambered for the Japanese 6.5x50mm round. The Type 11 also used a hopper feed using standard five-round clips. However, the Type 38's barrel was almost twice the length of the Type 11's (31 inches and 17 inches respectively). As a result, the Type 11 was issued its own less powerful ammunition, complicating the supply situation.
</li><li> This was also the case, though with much less supply issues, with German 7.92mm ammo during the war. While the MG 42 and Karabiner 98k used the same ammo, just in different forms (belted versus single bullets held in stripper clips), the MG was generally issued with a slightly more powerful version to ensure more reliable feeding and extraction (a problem that wasn't an issue for the manually-operated Kar98).
</li></ul></li><li> This was extremely common in the age of smoothbore muzzle-loaders, although if calibres were markedly different it could make a difference, so during the Napoleonic Wars it was possible to shoot French 17.5mm musketballs from British "Brown Bess" muskets, but 18mm balls suited to the Bess's larger calibre could not be fired from the standard French "Charleville" musket.
<ul><li> Wellington ordered that only pistols that could fire musketballs could be used in his army. This however had an underlying reason: pistols of a smaller calibre usually were dueling pistols.
</li><li> In the cases where a bullet wouldn't fit as-is, since it was just a bare lead ball, one could have captured enemy ammo, melted down the lead (which melts at a relatively low 327.46 °C/621.43 °F), and recast it in the appropriate caliber.
</li></ul></li><li> Intentionally subverted by the Soviets. Before and during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, the standard size for a medium mortar was 81mm. The Soviet Army built a medium mortar firing an 82mm round. That wasn't just cheap oneupmanship. The 82mm mortar could fire captured enemy ammunition at reduced efficiency, but if the enemy captured a supply of 82mm ammunition, it was completely useless to them unless they captured a mortar as well.
<ul><li> They did so again when they adopted the 9x18mm pistol round in the '50s, although this might not have been intentional. Under normal circumstances, a round of that diameter could theoretically be loaded into and fired from a weapon designed for the NATO standard 9x19mm. However, since the Soviets measured caliber slightly differently than NATO (by the lands in a rifled barrel, rather than the wider grooves), 9mm Makarov is 9<em>.2</em>mm by NATO measurements, so neither round can interchange. Intentional or not, however, this did prevent the sorts of issues that plagued the Soviets during WWII with the earlier 7.62x25mm Tokarev cartridge - since it was physically identical to the German 7.63x25mm cartridge, only fitting more propellant in the casing, German units that had captured Soviet submachine guns were able to load 7.63mm Mauser into those guns they didn't convert to 9mm and fire them without incident, while stolen German 7.63mm guns wouldn't be able to safely fire the Tokarev cartridge.
</li><li> The French did a similar subversion with the Chatellerault M1924/29 a few decades prior, though for the opposite reason as the Soviets. When it was first adopted in 1924, it was designed to use a 7.5x57mm round. This round was close enough in appearance to the German 7.92x57mm Mauser round that some auxiliary troops in Morocco who used captured Mauser rifles and ammo would accidentally load Mauser rounds into an M1924/29, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking">with disastrous results</a>. Starting from 1929 it was modified to use a slightly-shortened and now much more famous 7.5x54mm round so that 8mm Mauser rounds wouldn't fit into it or any future French weapons. This also led to a subversion decades later on the surplus market, since up until the 5.56mm FAMAS, all French military rifles afterward were standardized on the 7.5x54mm round: ammo for Swiss 7.5x55mm rifles is extremely common on the surplus market, and both cheaper and of considerably higher quality than the surplus French 7.5x54mm ammo (which is usually Syrian surplus, with the French Army having actually used up most of their own 7.5x54mm)...but the case is <em>just</em> enough longer that they're not interchangeable, even though the French round is directly derived from the Swiss one.
</li></ul></li><li> The Steyr AUG assault rifle also comes in a "Para" version firing 9x19mm. Conversion kits exist to change 5.56mm AUGs to 9mm. Counts doubly as this trope, as this version of the AUG is designed to load from the same magazines as Steyr's earlier MPi69 submachine gun. And, as above about NATO standardization agreements, there is a version of the gun (AUG NATO) designed to load from M16 magazines, though at the cost of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandedLeftHandedGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandedLeftHandedGuns">ambidextrous usability</a>.
<ul><li> The IWI Tavor is similarly designed for a multitude of different calibers, with the family of rifles as of 2019 including the basic 5.56mm alongside conversion kits or dedicated variants in 9x19mm, .300 Blackout, 5.45x39mm, 5.56x30mm MINSAS, and 7.62x51mm. They are even designed to use existing magazines in the respective calibers, e.g. the 9mm versions are designed to take the same magazines as the Colt 9mm SMG, since those are extremely common in several of its target markets.
</li></ul></li><li> One weird example is the Destroyer Carbine, chambered for the 9x23mm Largo pistol cartridge. This carbine was developed in Spain for police use. It was a bolt-action weapon whose action was basically that of a scaled-down Mauser 1893 rifle (not the WWI Mauser Gewehr 98 or the K98 we usually see, as the 1893 Mauser bolt cocked upon closing, whereas the G98 and K98 bolts cocked on opening) and fed by the same six- or ten-round magazines used by the Bergmann-Bayard Pistols employed by said Spanish Police units. So the average Spanish cop after 1921 was usually armed with both a pistol and a carbine chambered for the same ammo. In 1976, the Destroyer was no longer produced, having been slowly replaced by the Star Z-62, also chambered for 9x23mm Largo. Picking on cops in Spain tends to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingTheDragon">Bullying the Dragon</a>, as their police force has a <em>very</em> long history of ending political violence in the streets.
</li><li> This is even the case for bows and arrows, which have to be precisely matched to each other's draw length, stiffness etc. if they're to be used with anything approaching accuracy. Some armies in the past used bows with extremely short draw lengths, so that their short arrows would be literally useless to the enemy.
</li><li> Of special note is the British Sten, a submachine gun that chambered in the same 9mm Parabellum that was standard issue in the German army, since the ammo and weapons firing it were far easier to get their hands on (early battles in the African theatre netted them several thousands of 9mm rounds from surrendering Italian soldiers) than replacing the .45 Thompsons America lend-leased to them for the early stages of the war. Its magazines were even a direct copy of those of the MP 38, to facilitate using enemy ammo. Note though that there were minor differences between the MP 38 mags (and the clones made for the Sten) and the MP 40 mags that made them not interchangeable, despite what many have been lead to believe; at best, a Sten mag will technically fit into the magwell for an MP 40, but would require modification to either the gun or the magazine to hold properly.
<ul><li> Likewise, the Besa machine gun (used only in certain tanks) was left in its original 7.92x57 Mauser chambering due in part to the time and effort needed to convert it to .303, the fact that Armored Corps' supply chain was separate from the rest of the British Army and so would not be handicapped by using a nonstandard round, and the ease of using captured enemy ammunition.
</li></ul></li><li> The Medusa M47 revolver inverts and exaggerates the trope by being able to take <em>any</em> bullet that has a diameter of 9mm or less and up to or shorter than a .357 Magnum by using special extractor fingers that clamp onto the cartridge to properly hold it in place. Though, given the fact that the extractor fingers are very fragile and that the ammunition won't properly grip the rifling, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">you'll be lucky to score a shot beyond point-blank range.</a>
</li><li> Due to the extremely similar diameter between .308 Winchester (7.62x51mm) and the 7.62x39mm Soviet round, it's rather simple to convert weapons in the former to fire latter, such as Norinco's M305A - a rechambered version of their M14 copy - which differs from a standard M14 mostly by a slightly modified magazine release and some internal framework added into the magazine well to fit AK-pattern magazines. The existing bolt-locking mechanism even works properly with mags designed for AKs with their own bolt-hold devices (presumably in part due to that the AK's bolt is derived from that of the M1 Garand, itself a direct predecessor to the M14), though with iffy results - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ForgottenWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ForgottenWeapons">Ian McCollum</a> had to push up on the bottom of a Yugoslavian magazine to ensure it fed reliably in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byeMLdt2r-I">his video on<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the M305A, while a Russian AK mag that didn't lock the bolt open fed perfectly.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RareGuns/BattleRifles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RareGuns/BattleRifles">MAS-49 and MAS-49/56</a> have a unique kind of magazine system, where the magazine catch lever is on the magazine itself rather than part of the rifle.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note101gi8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note101gi8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note101gi8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was part of a production shortcut to get the earlier MAS-44 out as quickly as possible in the last days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>; it still wasn't fast enough to see service, but by the time they made the MAS-49 they kept using the same mag catch, since they already had thousands of the appropriate magazines.</span> This allows owners of surplus rifles to easily convert magazines for other weapons into extended MAS-49 magazines, assuming they fit into the 49's magwell and hold the appropriate ammo (like a 25-round FM 24/29 magazine), by welding a spare catch onto them.
