This does not affect life on Earth in any way, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">newspaper early on</a> mentions the problems coming from the moon and in the finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">things finally begin to settle as the moon collapses and becomes closer to Earth, eventually making the Earth's system return to normal.</span>
</li><li> Virtually every single episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em> simply <em>begins</em> with the eponymous robot exploding up from underground, taking streets, cars, skyscrapers, and one can only presume people along with it. And yet the chief of police is good friends with its pilot and never bitches him out for mass slaughter.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a> reveals that the entire two seasons were some sort of simulation or theatrical piece on a massive sound stage.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> during Aizen's invasion of Karakura Town, as the Shinigami replace it with a fake, uninhabited city in order to prevent their destructive abilities from killing everyone. By the time Aizen makes it to the real Karakura Town, only Ichigo is left to stop him, though the two of them alone are sufficiently powerful enough that Ichigo throws Aizen all the way into a massive faraway field for their final battle.
<ul><li> Most of the fighting in The Thousand-Year Blood War Arc takes place in cities, and initially it's averted as it's mentioned that thousands of people were killed during the destruction of the Seireitei. However, the trope's later played straight when the battles move toward the Quincies' domain, as even though buildings are still leveled, no one seems to be living in them.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, where the giant robot fights are shown quite explicitly to cause utter devastation to the area/city they are fighting in, with reports afterward (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if it was a "home" battle</span>) mentioning the hundreds if not thousands of dead and injured and (hundreds of) millions of dollars' worth of damage. This is even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">brought to our attention</a> during Kodaka Masaru's battle, where one of the characters observes that the "enemy" robot is going out of its way to cause as little damage as possible; Kodaka's response to this was to state that he couldn't care less and proceeds to move carelessly, trashing the city... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and ends up crushing his dad's car (with his dad inside it) in the process</span>. Cue BSOD when he realizes this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> Nightmare of Nunnally</em>, unlike in the main series, the consequences of triggering an avalanche on Narita are largely unexplored, given that the plot quickly moves on.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">main series</a> also plays this straight later on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Lelouch sets off Mount Fuji. No mention of an evacuation of all the towns surrounding the mountain for about 100 miles, which should include much of the Tokyo metropolitan area, is ever made</span>. This is mitigated by the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tokyo Settlement was the site of a nuke-equivalent explosion a few episodes earlier, causing millions of casualties and several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a></span> and further mitigated by the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch is going for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroApprovalGambit">Zero-Approval Gambit</a> (haha) at this point, so several hundred thousand casualties do more to advance his plans than anything else</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DirtyPairFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DirtyPairFlash">Dirty Pair Flash</a></em>: After one of their little "accidents" involving a space station, Kei and Yuri are ordered to send a hand-written letter of apology to each one of the 300,000 survivors.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders">Dolores, i</a></em>, the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a> causes a massive wave after falling to earth at hypersonic speeds, inundating a city up to at least the second floor. Although the damage is blamed on the heroes, there are oddly no fatalities mentioned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Piccolo <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetonationMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetonationMoon">blew up the moon</a></em> to stop a monkey from rampaging in a forest. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallAbridged">Dragon Ball Abridged</a></em> has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ys7pLfOVZDE#t=7m42s">something to say about this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Jackie Chun beat him to it in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>... but played with when the announcer for the tournament chews him out for it. Notably, they fixed it by having God make another one after Goku traded his tail... which didn't happen in the <em>DBZ</em> example.
</li><li> In addition, the opening animated sequence of <em>DBZ Budokai 2</em> has Goku slice the moon in half with a Kamehamaha. <em>Dragon Ball</em> just seems to have it in for the moon.
</li><li> The series also generally falls under this when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">especially destructive</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Ki Attacks</a>. Apparently something that is strong enough to blow a planet apart is no danger as long as it's not pointing down, even though that kind of thing should have sucked the atmosphere right off of Earth. An especially bad case was Vegeta's "Final Flash" attack against Perfect Cell, which made it into space despite being fired <em>horizontally</em> and apparently taking a <em>continent's</em> worth of land with it.
</li><li> The series often averts this trope as well, especially in the beginning. The protagonists will often force the fight away from civilization, as to avoid any innocent casualties during the explosive battles.
</li></ul></li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld">El-Hazard</a></em> OVA features this. When an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAnimal">Attack Animal</a> is awakened, one of the villains <em>immediately</em> orders her to destroy an <em>entire city</em>, which she goes about efficiently and brutally. Fortunately this is an unimportant city, and throughout the continuity said villain never faces any consequences for ordering this destruction. The main cast even confronts him in the sequel OVA and nobody even brings up the subject. This also holds true for the living weapon herself, although she technically had no choice in the matter.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> with 2 different pieces of technology. The heros knew that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> battles in cities were destructive. So they invented the Dividing Driver, which used Space Warping technology to create pocket dimensions for them to fight in. Later the enemies started exploding so violently when defeated that they became larger than the folded space. Enter the Eraser Head, which absorbed and redirected explosions straight upward, harmlessly into space.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, Millennium's attack on London results millions of civilian deaths and large sections of the city are levelled and/or burned. Nevertheless, Integra talks as though it wouldn't be a major blow to the nation and could be written off as an unusually large terrorist attack.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's</a></em>, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> show with lots of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Stuff Blowing Up</a>. Each battle take place in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone">Phantom Zone</a> that removes non-magicians, but static structures remain. At one point, the title character is sent crashing down into a building. At another point, a character forcefully enters the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone">Phantom Zone</a> and, upon landing, makes a crater on a building's rooftop. Some dialogue implies that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Bureau</a> has to fix the damaged areas before they can drop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomZone">Phantom Zone</a> effect. Due to some internal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> within the production company, the majority of fights in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">the third season</a> avert this by having the fights taking place in the abandoned part of a city the protagonists are stationed in. That way, they can blow up as much stuff as possible and nobody would care, since the infrastructure was abandoned anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em> partially averts it. The show constantly shows how much death and destruction would cause a humongous war mecha rampaging through the land or a battle between giant robots in a highly-populated city, and the heroes often have to suffer the consequences of it. Episode 7 gave an example when mobs of people â€” sick of people getting killed and homes getting demolished due to several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> battling â€” threw stones at the heroes and besieged the Institute and Kouji's house. Still, the series does not go into that topic with so much depth as it could. The sequels â€” <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UFORoboGrendizer">UFO Robo Grendizer</a></em> â€” dealt with the trope in similar fashion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> makes it abundantly clear that it intends to avert this from quite early on, not only showing how much damage is caused by Angel/ Eva scraps, but that people can and will get hurt or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">killed</a>, the first case being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Touji's sister</span>, who is mentioned to have been hospitalised after a building collapsed on her. It carries this on in later episodes, as big chunks of Tokyo 3 get turned into craters, eventually culminating in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a></span>.
<ul><li> There are even numerous occasions where this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>, mostly by NERV and SEELE personnel.
</li><li> The designers of Tokyo 3 knew it would become a battlefield for Angels and Evas. At first it seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>. Apparently, not enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em>, like its base mythos, intends to avert this trope, showing in great detail the devastation a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">massive tidal wave of liquified Angel</a> can wreak on a Japanese city. Mostly, it succeeds in conveying the reality that people will die because of the Angel Attacks by announcing over loud speakers the transference of all civilians to shelters and the retraction of large buildings â€” now unoccupied â€” below the surface roofing the Geofront. The trope isn't completely straight though, as, on several occasions, the military suffer dozens to hundreds of fatalities without acknowledgement: at least once, an <em>entire tank battalion</em> was sent to its death without so much as a shrug from our favourite bridge crew or child pilots.
</li></ul></li><li> Pell of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> saved Alubarna by flying the giant bomb (designed to annihilate the whole city and its inhabitants) straight up for a few seconds. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And he also survived the blast, even though he was clutching onto the bomb.

<ul><li> While it is implied that citizens die when Doflamingo has his Birdcage, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancingWallOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancingWallOfDoom">Advancing Wall of Doom</a>, converge on the island, the battle between Doflamingo and Luffy creates just as much destruction yet no one seems to be in danger, not even when Luffy actually splits the island in half. Also invoked when Pica becomes a giant golem whose steps can crush several buildings at a time, yet no one seems to be threatened by him except for the people he's personally targeting. Despite 90% of the island being turned into rubble by the end, everyone seems to be living normal lives and there seems to be an abundance of intact buildings a few days later.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Saitama shattered a meteorite about to wipe about several cities, but the debris created by destroying such meteorite devastated Z-City.</span> Of course, the damage would've been much worse had he stood still. The trope is still played straight in that Z-City is said to have suffered no deaths despite being all but destroyed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">PokÃ©mon</a></em>, there's one episode where a coastal city is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">attacked by a giant Tentacruel</a>. The place is flooded within seconds and several large buildings are destroyed, yet there's never any mention of injuries or deaths. That's to be expected, though, considering the show's place on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleofIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleofIdealismVersusCynicism">Sliding Scale</a>.

Homura says that Walpurgisnacht <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(that thing that was juggling ripped-up buildings in Madoka's dream)</span> will probably kill thousands of people even if they manage to defeat it. The muggles interpret it as a destructive superstorm. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But Madoka ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">erasing it from existence entirely</a>, so this doesn't happen.</span>
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCreators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ReCreators">Re:CREATORS</a></em>. As characters from anime and manga have been summoned into our world, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">magical girl</a> character is quite distraught to find that her heart-shaped, power of friendship-powered explosions now result in massive collateral damage and injuries.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Princess Hilda of Asgard</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">Poseidon</a> flood the Earth by melting the ice caps, the series goes out of its way to show the devastation from tidal waves and superstorms even in spite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierMaiden">Athena's</a> attempts to hold the waters back. When the villain du jour is defeated, though, it's considered a victory for mankind, and no mention is made of the millions of lives lost while the Saints battled. Likewise, the Gold Cloth Saga actually showed a very violent war breaking out, but it never reached the heroes and was never brought up before or after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s defeat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> often avoids this, but it's played straight when Lina <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">uses a Dragon Slave to blow up an enormous rock that threatened to fall on Seyruun. The spell accidentally destroys a sizable chunk of the city, and presumably kills hundreds of people</span>. However, people react more or less like they normally do when Lina Dragon Slaves stuff, as described above.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> adaptation of the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em>, it's stated that no one died when Chaos flooded downtown Station Square, because everyone evacuated in time. They also blew up the moon at one point.
<ul><li> For the former, 4Kids Entertainment didn't think that the implied details were good enough, so they had one of their developers state in the middle of the climax's episode that everyone (including those harmed in explosions and falls) were perfectly okay.
</li></ul></li><li> The series finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> has the entire cast fighting for the universe... in a robot large enough to use galaxies as weapons, which they do quite often. It's implied that the universe they fought in may have been created by their own warping power, and so nobody was actually in trouble. It may also be a pocket dimension that serves as the Anti-Spiral's home universe.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">Lagann-hen</a></em> takes it one step further and <em>explicitly</em> destroys the universe they were fighting in. The only way that scene makes sense is if they were in a pocket universe.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, where, as part of an explicit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifismBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifismBackfire">Pacifism Backfire</a> event, Vash is told of what happened to a city he accidentally blew up. Vash himself managed to avoid killing anyone... but the now-homeless people were forced to trek out into the desert in a desperate hope for survival, and most if not all of them explicitly died of starvation and thirst. As tends to happen when random civilians are forced to flee into the desert by the destruction of their hometown.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UFOPrincessValkyrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UFOPrincessValkyrie">UFO Princess Valkyrie</a></em> has a huge UFO crash-landing in the middle of a bathhouse, still filled with visitors, with exactly one casualty â€” which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstEpisodeResurrection">instantly rectified</a>. Somewhat later, a destructive fight between a crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catgirl">catgirl</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlWithPsychoWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlWithPsychoWeapon">With Psycho Weapons</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KamehameHadoken">Kamehame Hadoken</a>-throwing space-princess leaves several large chasms blasted through the entire cityscape. Neither the potentially-astronomical casualties, nor the damage to the city, are mentioned again. But the catgirl apologized, so it's cool...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X/1999</a></em> averts this where the Dragons of Heaven knew that their battles against the Dragons of Earth caused a lot of collateral damages and many casualties. This gave them the ability to create a <em>kekkai</em> (barrier field) where it protects the area and the civilians from being damaged. When a Dragon of Heaven dies, their barrier field gets destroyed along with the area and the people in it. The only Dragon of Heaven who can't create a barrier field is Kamui and he's aware of it <em>painfully</em> which is why he's hopeless in stopping Fuuma from destroying much of Tokyo.

Hulk's buddy, Amadeus Cho, tries to explain this by suggesting that the Hulk is amazingly gifted, doing math to know exactly where every chunk of debris he creates will fall.
<ul><li> At least during The Hulk and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>'s bout in <em>DC Vs.

</li><li> Averted in <em>Banner,</em> where the plot involves testing The Hulk as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapon of Mass Destruction</a> by repeatedly dropping him in populated areas where he wakes up to find entire square city blocks leveled, complete with strewn body parts.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>, in his 30-odd years of punishing (racking up something in the order of 2000+ bodies, it's estimated) has never killed an innocent. It's reasoned that Frank's whole schtick is that he's a phenomenally well trained, extremely diligent US Marine, who makes damn sure everything's in place before he starts his "work".
<ul><li> In the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WelcomeBackFrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WelcomeBackFrank">Welcome Back, Frank</a>" Trade Paperback, he actually kills a copycat vigilante for not taking the same precautions and accidentally killing an innocent.
</li><li> That's really a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. Even discarding the cases where he was arguably insane or under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>, the Punisher already shot innocents. In his very first appearance, he goes after Spider-Man who was framed by the Jackal. He shot Steve Rogers in the chest in <em>Punisher/Captain America: Blood &amp; Glory</em>, almost killing him. A stray bullet also hits a vagrant while Frank Castle is shooting at Daredevil in <em>Daredevil vs The Punisher</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight for the most part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em>. The city is frequently attacked by hundred-foot-tall monsters or rampaging gods, but most collateral damage either occurs off-screen or with scenes showing heroes rescuing civilians. Most aftermath is limited to broken windows and litter in the streets, and the residents take this all in stride, praising the city's robust public works services.
<ul><li> Generally averted in stories set in the late 70s/early 80s (Astro City's version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks">The Dark Age of Comic Books</a>), though.

Inside the outline of Kong are lots of outlines of people apparently flattened when he fell off the Empire State Building.

Every time it happens, she feels horribly guilty.

Additionally, where possible, Doctor Strange (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seer">Seer</a> who knows when the excrement is about to hit the rotating device) evacuates local populations in advance. However, it's made abundantly clear that the Battle of New York claimed dozens of lives, and the Battle of London had casualties too - because while measures were taken to clear Central London of civilians as far as possible, London is still an enormous and densely populated city, and the battle quickly went global.

That is to say, the plan works, but it leads to painful headaches across the world for even ordinary humans, increasing levels of psychic agony for those who are more powerful, and in at least one case, violently activates a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seer">Seers</a> powers, breaking them in the process, resulting in her becoming a mild case of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadOracle">Mad Oracle</a>.

Namely, if the sun and moon are moved by their leaders, what happens when those leaders go away to conquer another planet? Answer: the sun and moon stop moving, leaving the planet to bake to death on one half and freeze to death on the other while what little habitable land eventually is used up and the populace dies out.

By all rights, this should have sunk Arcadia into the ocean, but all it does is knock out the power and cause some minimal damage. Most remarkably, the protagonists and the Queen herself, who are <em>at the point of impact</em> survive, even though it leaves a huge crater. (Possibly justified. It's suggested that her magic was protecting them, as she wanted to see the battle to its conclusion.)

<ul><li> In Episode 67, it's specifically stated that the Galaxy Crusher â€” a Demon battlestation the size of a <em>red giant</em> â€” cannot be deployed anywhere near planets or stars. Its sheer size messes up gravity so much that being anywhere near it destroys planets.

The <a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Endor_Holocaust">Wookieepedia article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> explains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">canonically</a>, the Endor Holocaust did not happen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscontinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscontinuityNod">only existing as Imperial propaganda</a>. Later material would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> it by explaining that the Death Star's destruction created a wormhole (long story; just know the Death Star was intended for faster-than-light capabilities) that sucked most of the debris (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGloveOfDarthVader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGloveOfDarthVader">The Glove of Darth Vader</a>) into parts unknown, with any dangerous leftovers being caught in Rebel tractor beams. Furthermore, there has been a rebuttal to the original theory that argues the original theory overestimated the size of the Death Star by a substantial amount (though even the low estimate is pretty nasty). Finally, and most bluntly, the Rebels and Ewoks would <em>not</em> have been able to throw that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding">epic party</a> on the surface, which is shown to take place at nightfall. If the hypothetical holocaust were to happen, it would have caused problems by then. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em> finally put the debate to bed once and for all, showing that Endor had survived the destruction of the Death Star II just fine, and that the biggest pieces of debris had impacted on another, nearby and apparently uninhabited (at least, at the time of the Battle of Endor) moon named Kef Bir.
<ul><li> It should be noted, that the explosion as shown in movie is quite slow, and most fragments would probably not reach enough velocity to immediately drop on Endor. Instead, they would most likely form a slowly spreading orbital cloud, then ring around Endor.
</li><li> It should also be noted, for the benefit of those still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RootingForTheEmpire">Rooting for the Empire</a>, that the (now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a>} Imperial Propaganda regarding Endor's alleged holocaust never mention that it was the Empire that put the shield generator there in the first place and parked the Death Star 2 above it, essentially drafting those poor Ewoks as meat shields. But hey, let's just pretend the Rebels picked that site because of the scenery.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> features a sequence where Obi-Wan and Anakin try to pilot General Grievous' flagship, <em>Invisible Hand</em> to an emergency runway on Coruscant after the engines suffer irreparable damage. On their way down, the ship splits in two, with the back half flying off behind them, undeniably hitting a section of the planet out of sight. Other random debris flies off on screen, but never once is an impact shown, nor are their aftereffects discussed - though the smoke and damage are seen in a few background shots, and in fairness, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">the protagonists had other things to worry about</a>. Further, after they entered the atmosphere, they were accompanied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">fireships</a> who were presumably trained and equipped to deal with the debris (though the entire back half of the ship breaking off in one chunk may have been too much for them to handle).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em> initially looks like it's going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert</a> the trope with the considerable concern about the collateral damage which would be caused by staging a nuclear attack on one of the alien ships, but then plays it straight anyway in the climax:
<ul><li> The destroyed battleship was directly over the Area 51 bunker when it was destroyed (from beneath and in the center), yet it goes flying to one side until it's completely clear before crashing into the desert. How convenient; if it had gone straight down, it would have buried the bunker entrance and trapped everyone inside.
</li><li> The mothership was destroyed with a nuclear warhead that apparently made its reactor explode. See that debris burning up in the skies? That's nuclear fallout irradiating the atmosphere of the entire hemisphere. There's also the issue of 18.4 quintillion tons of alien mothership rubble falling out of orbit... or not. If it stays up there then <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome">space is now an unusable cluttered junkyard<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. If it falls in big chunks it's the end of life on Earth. If it falls in small chunks the heat of friction as it burns up will likely render the Earth uninhabitable.
</li><li> Nothing of the sort is mentioned in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDayResurgence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDayResurgence">sequel</a>. While many people (over 3 billion = half the population of the world at the time) were killed during the attacks on cities, those cities were eventually rebuilt (except Vegas, which became a memorial). Two decades later, not only has humanity rebuilt, but we also have several bases throughout the Solar System. As pointed out by a number of people doing basic calculations, the more likely result of losing most major cities and half the population (especially in the industrial countries) would be a complete collapse of global society and the inability to restore it for centuries, if ever. People would be struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic world instead of rebuilding everything as it was and building bases on the Moon.
</li><li> The damage from the events of the sequel should be even worse, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a> ending makes no indication that Earth is doomed. The Super Mothership that arrives is so massive it appears to have more gravity than the moon, and when it lands on the surface of the Earth it covers roughly 1/4 of the surface. An object with that much mass that close to Earth would effect its orbit and fracture the crust. To say nothing of having rammed the moon on the way in, likely knocking it out of orbit, or the mile wide hole it vaporized through the crust (and probably enough water to lower sea levels hundreds of feet) to within mere feet of the mantle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlienResurrection">Alien: Resurrection</a></em> ends with the good guys destroying the aliens on the research ship by crashing it into Earth's surface. We get a view from space as it crashes into what appears to be the east coast of either Africa or India, producing an <em>enormous</em> explosion that realistically would undoubtedly have killed millions... <em>maybe</em> more than a xenomorph infestation. In this case it is implied that Earth was already a devastated wasteland ("Earth. What a shithole."). The Special Edition contains an alternate ending with the protagonists in the ruins of Paris, which appears to be a wasteland. There's also a scene where Call says she re-calibrated ground level â€” ensuring the ship would crash in an uninhabited quadrant.
<ul><li> The novelization says that Earth is mostly abandoned at this point with people either living on space stations or colony planets.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlienOutOfTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlienOutOfTheShadows">Sea Of Sorrows</a></em> novel said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Weyland Yutani</a> came back into power by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraforming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraforming">Terraforming</a> technology to fix the damage done by the Auriga.
</li><li> The <em>Original Sin</em> novel plays the trope straight by being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmediateSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmediateSequel">Immediate Sequel</a> that starts with The Betty landing on an overcrowded Earth with no mention of the Auriga landing.

Alfred calls him out on his recklessness and emphasizes that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">a miracle that no one was killed.</a>
</li><li> Bruce's actions set off a chain reaction, leading to the complete destruction of the ninja-monastery he was training at. It's rather unrealistic to think everyone made it out alive, especially the <em>shackled prisoners</em>. The extra irony is that Bruce rebelled in the first place because he had been ordered to kill one of said criminals. Sure, he went out of his way to ensure that Ducard didn't die, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">even that didn't turn out to be such a good idea</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em> he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveBeenMessy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouldHaveBeenMessy">tremendously lucky</a> that there was no one <em>in</em> any of those cars he blew up (we even see two kids playing in a car <em>one row over</em>), or that no shrapnel from the Batmobile's "intimidate" setting hit those vagrants, and that when he went barreling on a very large, fast, heavy motorbike-thing through a shopping centre all the people in his way were agile enough to leap out of it. What if they'd chanced to be disabled, or obese, or if they'd simply frozen in shock?
</li><li> In the third act of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Batman shoots at Bane's Tumblers with the Batwing.

Then he fires on the truck carrying the bomb to stop it, which kills Talia, and several tall buildings explode while he tries to take the bomb out of the city, with the implication that he blew them up, killing anyone in them or near them. What does it take to get Batman to break his one rule? A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">nuclear bomb</a>, apparently</span>.

Flash "saves" the world just in time, but... er... forget it.
<ul><li> Granted, given the complexity of steering objects in space, and given that the moon seemed to need constant guidance, the Moon and the Earth presumably did not collide, but the tidal stress on both bodies from the close approach would be utterly appalling, enough to flood every coastline, trigger every dormant volcano, start record-setting earthquakes, and that's barely the start of it. Not to mention the long term effects of a drastically more erratic lunar orbit...

Also, they all knew it was going to explode, they probably stood well back.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></em> movies play this trope both ways.

But then it's played straight elsewhere in the films â€” at no point in either of the films (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostbustersTheVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostbustersTheVideoGame">the 2009 video game</a>) is it confirmed that <em>anyone</em> has died from an encounter with a ghost. Considering some of the things we've seen the ghosts do (such as ghost driving vehicles â€” poorly), human casualties were a very real possibility.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansEleven">Ocean's Eleven</a></em> remake, Danny's crew uses an electromagnetic device to shut off all electricity in Las Vegas for 30 seconds. Realistically, we should be looking at pacemakers going haywire, car crashes in the thousands, hospital equipment failing, and God help them if any planes were flying low over the city when it happened. Yet the sequels still only refer to them as thieves, not as the most successful and high-tech terrorists of all time. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0d6qa');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0d6qa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0d6qa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It's possible that the device was set up such that it would cause an electrical disturbance that would upset the Las Vegas power grid. Most electrical grids are set up to shut down when it detects anomalies to save itself. Case in point, the blackout of Southern California/Northern Mexico in 2011 was caused by a problem with one of the distribution hubs... in Arizona.</span>
<ul><li> They follow it up by causing a localized <em>earthquake</em> in the heart of the Strip for <em>Ocean's Thirteen</em>, severe enough to send the Bank's clients and employees scrambling for the exits.

While the people in charge do express dismay over these events, nowhere is it implied that anyone got killed, and the news voiceover that closes the film seems more concerned with the fate of the helicopter than with the flaming debris raining down over the city.

Good luck making use of that land. Yes, Klaatu mentions our way of life will have to change. He just didn't mention most of us would die, while he happily flies off home, mission complete. <br/><br/>It is possible that <em>was</em> his intention. Reduce the human population, take away our ability to mess up our planet.

The land simply cannot support 6 billion people without industry, so every living creature would be killed for food and every available acre cleared and tilled.

Everybody is happy, but there is still a big hole in the bay, which can lead to all sorts of bad things for San Francisco and Starfleet (whose HQ and academy are in the city). Additionally, the film fails to mention that Starfleet is now in a bad shape, thanks to the loss of the majority of the graduating class and 6 top-of-the-line starships. There is also the loss of one of the founding member worlds of the Federation. There is also the threat of another war with the Romulans. Good luck convincing people that Nero was not associated with the Empire.

Elsewhere, Matt says to Karen that "the world watched half of New York get destroyed", though this appears to be hyperbole since the Chitauri appeared to confine the battle to Midtown Manhattan and didn't go into any of the other boroughs or Jersey City. It's also mentioned that the battle caused real-estate values in Hell's Kitchen to drop dramatically, and this is the reason Matt and Foggy can afford the office space in which they set up Nelson &amp; Murdock.

</li><li> While not an explosion, the climax to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FastFive">Fast Five</a></em> entails a chase where two muscle cars are dragging a vault filled with 100 million dollars through the streets of Rio. As they weave and turn the vault naturally does a lot of collateral damage to property, including going through a bank window in the middle of the day. We even see a woman standing right in front of the bank in the cut before the vault hits it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a></em>, while little is shown, it seems almost every world leader getting their heads blown off, along with many government officials and corporate figures, and millions killed across the globe as result of Valentine's SIM cards driving everyone insane with rage, seemed to done little to affect everyday life. Though that being said, the ones locked up by Valentine like the Swedish princess are likely to have taken the place of those whose heads were just blown off. The movie also ends mere minutes after Valentine is defeated, so there wasn't time to explore the possible long-term side effects of his partially implemented evil plan.
</li><li> Closely related is the climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent">The Divergent Series: Allegiant</a></em> where a gas is released in the city that will wipe everyone's memories.

<ul><li> Countless soft science-fiction stories feature weapons that are said to vaporize a person shot with them. The effects of those weapons are very often depicted as making the victim disappear without any effect on the surroundings, rather than creating a large steam explosion. <em>Literally</em> vaporizing a human would make him blow up like a grenade, only with several times the energy.
</li><li> Other stories feature weapons that are said to convert the entire mass of their targets to energy. Taken literally, this should result in effects much like those of a nuclear bomb. Dealt with 'realistically' as part of the plot in Neal Asher's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePolity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePolity">Polity</a> novel <em>Gridlinked</em>. The interplanetary transport system, called a runcible, is sabotaged causing a single person to arrive at a planet as pure energy. The ensuing explosion and resultant environmental impact kills off the entire planetary colony.
</li><li> Commented upon in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> novel where a commander berates a subordinate about firing indiscriminately in a crowded city in order to get to him. So it was a simulator fight, but it was still reckless behavior. The novels nonetheless show plenty of instances of combat in an urban setting. The presumably resulting civilian casualties are rarely even mentioned in passing unless it's explicitly a plot point (like the Smoke Jaguars' orbital bombardment and resulting total destruction of Edo, which was in fact considered over the top by even their allies and a genuine war crime by most everybody else). The Jade Falcons repeat the orbital bombardment in the animated series, but it's explicitly stated that the city's population was evacuated prior to the bombardment. A sourcebook for the series goes into further detail, comparing the two incidents, and bringing up the question of what the Falcons did with the people afterwards.
<ul><li> In <em>BattleTech</em>, it's considered a fact that if you fight in a city, there <em>will</em> be civilian casualties. However, this trope is played straight in that the fusion reactors that power Battlemechs, if ruptured, would spread radioactive products<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1crr3');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1crr3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1crr3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">most notably tritiated water</span> over a decent radius, but cities are never rendered even temporarily irradiated from this happening despite centuries of warfare. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">tritiated water is only a weak beta emitter, carries no adverse health effects from external exposure, and is only an extremely mild radiation hazard when ingested.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Deconstructed and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Final Watch</a></em>. As explained there is a fundamental difference between Mass Sleep spells used by the Light Ones and the Dark Ones. The Light version allows the victim a few moments of consciousness to put whatever he's doing to a halt and make himself comfortable. The Dark one simply knocks everybody out. After the Dark spell is used the characters enter the area of effect and register numerous crashed cars, starting fires and other unpleasantries. This is also why no one is keen on resurrecting a mad ancient dragon mage in an earlier novel, as he would then rampage across Europe, unaware of the Grand Treaty (and not caring in the least). Sure, humans would eventually put him down with modern weaponry, but untold millions would still die.

However, this is still viewed as a victory, as the aliens were planning on enslaving humanity. This also serves to drive humanity to the stars in the later novels of the series. In all fairness, though, 40 million people is still a little low, given that these modules were filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antimatter">Antimatter</a>. The only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> we get is a mention that the explosions were surprisingly small and were mainly limited to several miles in diameter.

The rocks are carefully guided to cause minimum casualties (in the hundreds or maybe thousands at most), and in fact many were aimed at completely unpopulated areas as a show of force. However, some were aimed near heavily populated areas and if they were intercepted they were knocked off their intended course and caused a lot more damage. In addition, the ones aimed at unpopulated areas? Some people decided to mock the aim of the Lunar residents and <em>picnic</em> in some of those places. A textbook example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>.
<ul><li> In fairness, those "heavily populated areas" were next door to the military bases and spaceports the Moonies were trying to bomb in the first place, not the actual targets themselves. And only one or two are mentioned as having been knocked off course in such a manner. (They specifically avoided targeting the headquarters of the government they were revolting against, since it happened to be dangerously close to the Taj Mahal. Quite apart from the PR implications of destroying the Taj Mahal, it was the favorite building of the revolutionary prime minister.)
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterpriseRelaunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterpriseRelaunch">Beneath the RaptorÂ’s Wing</a></em>, several starships carrying antimatter explode in orbit over Andoria. The planet is fine, but characters do note that had the explosions been a certain degree more powerful, the atmosphere <em>could</em> have been stripped away.
</li><li> In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NuklearAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NuklearAge">Nuklear Age</a></em>, this is parodied to an extent; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab">Giant Enemy Crab</a> rampages through the city, destroying entire buildings, but no one is harmed because everyone happens to be out on a lunch break. Later, when a city block is nuked, casualties are handwaved by the fact that the people of the city had already been sent off to work in warehouses and construction zones, to build an invasion fleet for their new hypnotic master; and, towards the end, the trope is subverted with a quite vivid description of casualties.
</li><li> Partly averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VladimirVasilyev" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VladimirVasilyev">Vladimir Vasilyev</a> and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderGromov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderGromov">Alexander Gromov</a>'s novel <em>Antarctic-online</em>, in which the titular continent inexplicably finds itself in Central Pacific, while the islands that used to occupy the area find themselves near the South Pole. While the novel largely focuses on the political consequences of a continent that nobody wants suddenly becoming prime real estate, there is plenty of talk about the ecological consequences, such as many coastal cities being flooded in the near future as the result of the melting Antarctic ice cap (this is handled, more or less, realistically â€” it's stated that the process will last for millennia given the sheer amount of ice). There are immediate effects, though, such as tidal waves hitting the coasts from the sudden shift, and the numerous Polynesian islands, stuck in the Antarctic Circle, to evacuate. The world's nations wish to blame somebody, and the blame falls on the newly-declared sovereign Antarctic nation. Many nations demand reparations from Antarctic representatives, even though the continental "jump" was not their fault (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually, the ending reveals that it was accidentally caused by one of them, who had found a strange-looking orb and dropped it.

This vicious battle results in debris continuing to fall from orbit for decades. Not that the colonists mind, as nearly all of them were massacred by mercenary squads sent ahead of the Imperial fleet as punishment.
</li><li> <em>Defied</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreamPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DreamPark">The Barsoom Project</a></em>, in which two bitterly-hostile diplomats are invited to play out their enmity in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">War-Bots</a> simulation. The simulation pits them against one another in gargantuan battle-robots in the middle of a London suburb ... and <em>completely</em> averts this trope, with simulated tiny people fleeing in terror, being crushed by every robotic footstep, buried alive by every crumbled building, or flash-fried in seconds when a mecha's foot punches through the ground into a busy subway tunnel. The diplomats' ears are regaled by ever-increasing numbers of agonized screams as the collateral damage piles up; by the time their fight ends, both men are <em>near tears</em> at the destruction of tiny innocents, and <em>frantic</em> to go back to negotiating peacefully.

<ul><li> In the season 4 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>, a military-grade nuclear missile is intercepted and destroyed just above downtown LA seconds before it was to detonate. While this should have spread several kilos of plutonium across the city in a "dirty bomb" effect, nobody seems to be concerned about this aside from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> about NEST cleaning up the scene. Although the plutonium would only be particularly dangerous if inhaled or eaten, as the alpha radiation it emits wouldn't penetrate your skin. There was some handwave about prevailing winds blowing it away from the city. This is however still much better than the bomb actually going off, though.
<ul><li> Plutonium itself is much less radioactive than its fission products, which would be produced by nuclear explosion.
</li><li> <em>24</em> largely averts this trope otherwise. In Season 2, they have to fly a nuclear bomb out of LA to have it detonate elsewhere. The short and long term effects of it detonating in the Pacific Ocean and the desert are both discussed. The only real concern for the desert is the fallout, but the ocean has a whole mess of problems. The characters routinely state they can't shoot down aircraft over populated areas, as the debris would result in fatalities. In a possible nod to Season 4 above, in Season 6 they stop a suitcase nuke from going off but there is a radiation leak. It is contained quickly, but it's pointed out that there will still be consequences from it.

This is justified because we see the beam pass by the Moon before it strikes the ship. So, we should be able to assume the ship is more than 300,000km away from the planet and still fleeing, which momentum would be preserved by the debris. Earth's atmosphere stops at around 100km for all practical purposes, and there aren't many particles in the exosphere. Yes, parts of the ship reach the Mesosphere, burning like meteors into ash. Really, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">explosion shouldn't have been that large on screen</a>.

The same thing happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD">Power Rangers S.P.D.</a></em>, where the B-Squad Rangers had to clean up debris after the A-Squad's mecha battle.
</li></ul></li><li> An EMP problem ensued in an episode of the short-lived alien invasion drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Threshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Threshold">Threshold</a></em>, where an EMP is unleashed in Miami to keep an alien signal from spreading. They know that it will cause a panic and result in various damages. There are injuries from it and the leader is told that there are no casualties <em>so far</em>. Caffrey also points out that the simple truth is they have stop the alien signal from getting out, regardless of collateral damage.
<ul><li> To the show's credit, they take another two steps. A minimum safe-distance is cleared around the device, so no one is killed by the EMP itself; and they make no planes (and presumably helicopters) are in the blast radius when it goes off.
</li><li> A less lethal example; A character smugly points out that anyone losing data because of the EMP have only themselves to blame for not backing up, completely ignoring the many perfectly responsible backup schemes that don't go as far as storing the backed up data somewhere outside of your city (and this is before cloud backup became a widespread option too).

<ul><li> Discussed and averted in the Series 4 story "The Empty Planet". After almost all humans are briefly taken away, Clyde and Rani notice that the streets are surprisingly clean and unwrecked. This was deliberate on the part of the aliens; they phase-shifted all the moving vehicles away along with the people so that there would be no crashes, leaving behind only the parked ones.
</li><li> In the final story of Series 4, "Goodbye, Sarah Jane Smith", however, our heroes defeat Ruby White by projecting a hologram of a meteor shower all over the world to overwhelm her with the human race's panic. The fact that this would logically result in crashes and heart attacks is never mentioned. We could assume that it was worth it to stop her from becoming powerful enough to destroy the world, but no one even brings it up.
</li><li> "Death of the Doctor" does a single-character version of this by making it clear that Barbara Wright is still alive off-screen, contradicting the common dark fanon that gave her the real-life early death from cancer of her actor Jacqueline Hill, and blamed it on her irradiation on Skaro.

<ul><li> Huge sections of Atlantis are regularly demolished by alien invaders, natural disasters and our heroes â€” yet this seems to have very little overall impact on the city as a whole and the population, which appears to stay remarkably steady in numbers. Although the latter could be explained after contact is re-established with Earth as new personnel arriving to fill the gaps. Still, all in all, Atlantis is a <em>gigantic</em> city with some self-repairing ability. Over 90% of it is uninhabited; the expedition (numbering a couple thousand at most) stays almost exclusively in the central tower, while the Athosians live in colonies on the mainland.
</li><li> In "Adrift", a huge section of the city is taken out by an asteroid â€” Sheppard and Zelenka have to hop it in zero-g. No mention is never made of the missing chunk again, nor can it be seen in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingShot">establishing shots</a>.
</li><li> In "Enemy at the Gate", a larger-than-normal Wraith hive ship blows up in low Earth orbit. In fact, the nuclear blast appears to vaporize the ship. There is an incredibly bright flash, and then nothing. No consequences for Earth either. Then there's a giant Ancient city-ship crash-landing in the San Francisco Bay.

The original ending before the extended cut involved exploding mass relays, some of which were located in rather populated solar systems, including our Earth's solar system. Add to that that an exploding relay would, according to the aforementioned <em>Arrival</em> DLC, destroy a solar system, and you might realize that humanity would have become a lot rarer.

A slightly more justifiable example from the same game occurs during the final boss, where the heroic NPCs comment that they were able to escape the aliens' comet/organic spaceship, freeing the protagonist to not worry about destroying the thing.

Yes, the human and Vasudan colonies have survived, as shown by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> and the sequel, and have even prospered. But what about Earth? It has been cut off from the rest of the galaxy, meaning it's probably overpopulated, low on resources, and just had lost the ability to trade with other worlds, meaning planetary economy will be in ruins. Neither the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a> nor the sequel show what happens to Earth after the collapse of the wormhole. If <em>Freespace 3</em> is ever made, it should be about pissed off descendants coming back into the galactic community to "thank" everybody for cutting off their only link to the rest of the galaxy.
<ul><li> Yes, Earth was saved from being turned into an uninhabitable wasteland by the <em>Lucifer</em>, no one had any idea that blowing up a giant ship in subspace would destroy the subspace node it was done in and the ones who did it were stuck on the Earth side of the node, but humans tend to have short memory for good things and long memory for bad. The descendants will definitely blame their colonies and will probably think they caused this intentionally to gain independence.

</li><li> This is addressed by numerous fan-made sequels, which often feature a war breaking out when the GTVA repairs the node and re-opens passage to Earth. There are also some fan-made stories taking place within the Sol system after the cutoff, generally showing the fragmentation of society, civil wars, and (usually) eventual reunification under a new government.

He decides to destroy the lab by setting fire to it using fireworks and explosives that also happen to be inside.

In the books, Super MACs in particular are described as so powerful that they fire at 0.04% the speed of light, which in real life would cause ecological disaster on the scale of the meteor that killed the dinosaurs, nevermind that the shockwave alone actually has the potential to <em>rend continents and set the atmosphere itself on fire</em>. The seemingly careless use of them near the ground in <em>Reach</em> is lampshaded by one character, who expresses surprise that a mere <em>regular</em> (i.e. non-"Super") MAC cannon being used in-atmosphere. His commander's remark "One way to get [the Covenant]'s attention" suggests it's because they've passed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>.

<ul><li> In the "City of Stone" arc, Demona casts a spell that turns the large majority of Manhattan's population into stone during the night hours. Leaving aside all the physical damage that is likely to have occurred, the fact that Manhattan in effect stops working from dusk to dawn (which, given the fact that the story takes place in early November, would be from roughly 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) for two consecutive days should have caused a nationwide panic, and had notable economic impact.

The class realizes that an asteroid is about to hit their school, and decide to deflect it. They do this by <em>causing the bus to grow to the size of the moon</em>, so its gravity will pull the asteroid off-course. Now think for a moment about what the effects of an object the size of the moon appearing suddenly in Earth's orbit would be. . .

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MightyMax">Mighty Max</a>,</em> probably most harshly in "CyberSkull II: The Next Level." The villains force his pawn to channel all the electricity in the world into a machine meant to free him from the Internet. The episode itself doesn't show it, but Max points out hospitals and other places need that power, and we're left to assume a lot of people are dead by the time Max and his buddies get things back to normal.

</li><li> <em>Tanks For The Memories</em> has the entire Weather Factory be blown up and bury all of Ponyville in snow, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waved</a> as it happening during "lunch hour" so all the workers were out eating when it happened. Even if we're to assume nobody stayed in to eat, or was on the can, or backlogged and working through lunch, or napping during their break, it's still very unlikely burying all of Ponyville in an avalanche didn't give a few ponies a very bad time.
</li><li> A <em>massive</em> portion of Canterlot is blown to smithereens in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>. Though some of the guards were dumped in the moat by Cozy Glow prior, previous episodes have shown there to be many more guards and civilian staff in the palace who hopefully had some life insurance, to say nothing of the flying debris that probably ruined the day of more than a few ponies. This all passes without mention, with Twilight Sparkle only mentioning that she's going to rebuild.

Even though Phineas and Ferb <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GondorCallsForAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GondorCallsForAid">(and similar geniuses from around the world)</a> put the Earth back in a matter of hours, the damage it should have caused would be catastrophic to ecosystems around the world. But it shows that everything is fine afterwards (even the trees have their leaves back).
</li><li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SymBionicTitan">Sym-Bionic Titan</a></em> have enormous sections of the city annihilated, which one may realize by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> that THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT PEOPLE ARE DEAD, but the few times that the actual damage is addressed, only the damage to property is mentioned, often by an official. In the latter case, it is all but stated that lots of people died, and the show does often show people and monsters dying.
</li><li> Yet another blunder from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Redakai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Redakai">Redakai</a></em>. "Kairu", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Life-energy of the universe</a>, is regularly made off with by the heroes. However, the presence of the energy generates prosperity with the surrounding wildlife. The heroes realize this in one episode when they find some of the energy on a farm where one of them grew up. They decide to leave the energy where it was in this case, <em>but what happened to the places that they have taken the energy from before and since?!</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a> Star Wars Episode 2</em> directly parodies the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> by having large chunks of the destroyed Death Star II raining down and massacring Ewoks.

She runs through the town warning everyone and everyone is apparently able to make it to safety â€” afterwards one character says "it's a miracle nobody was killed". Though in a touch of realism, Sabrina is still extremely upset about flooding the town. Also time rewinds itself so that the flooding never happens.

Spidey shows up, and they do what superheroes and villains have done for ages...only now they do it on an oil tanker. In New York harbor. At least the <em>Valdez</em> wasn't anywhere near a human port of millions of people, though I'm sure that was cold comfort to the wildlife.
</li><li> The last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> features <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Star destroying all magic in the multiverse, causing the deaths of all magical beings.

This might be intentional on her part though, as there are fish swimming around in the tower and they seem to be perfectly happy. The tower pretty abruptly collapses when Lapis leaves Earth, and this doesn't seem to cause any problems for the fish either, or for anyone else when all this water crashes back into the Earth at a high speed.

Although a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">direct collision</a> by this comet is narrowly avoided, humanity is still knocked back to the Stone-Age-plus-cheesy-magic by the gravitational havoc it wreaks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, Primus' vehicle mode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">is the planet Cybertron itself</a>. Transforming into his robot mode does <em>not</em> follow this trope, which is the main reason he doesn't do it.
<ul><li> This is taken further in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em>: not only does Primus' body make up Cybertron, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Earth is actually a dormant Unicron. When Unicron begins to wake up, it causes massive worldwide environmental havoc. Not only that, but he can also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusLoci">control the surface of the Earth</a>, making "mini" clones of himself out of mountainsides.</span> The Autobots <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">and Megatron</a> team up to shut him back down before he actually destroys the planet and to prevent this trope. However, it's ultimately played straight, as despite the environmental damage, there are no reports of lives lost during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Unicron's</span> "morning stretch".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> Bulkhead warps an about-to-explode burning oil tower into the middle of the lake. Better than the alternative, sure, but what about the pollution from the oil? Though near <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceWorseThanDeath">Detroit</a>, who'd notice?

The Autobots are motivated to stop him primarily to prevent Earth being bombarded with billions of asteroids. However, after Mars does explode, no mention is ever made of Earth being damaged.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>: the planet the show takes place on is prehistoric Earth, and in the series finale Megatron, while onboard a working spaceship, with a weapon that outright killed the near-god-like Tigerhawk, opens fire on a tribe of protohumans.

</li><li> New WMD technologies and anything else involving large explosions or forays into the fundamental forces of the universe are often accompanied by a group of die-hard doomsday prophets proclaiming that this New Thing will definitely bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>. So far, no device has lived up to this expectation. For instance, it was hypothesized that traveling at over forty mph (this was back when trains were just being introduced) would cause fatal brain hemorrhages<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note558rf');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note558rf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note558rf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As well as that the air would be sucked out of the carriages, killing everyone onboard</span>. Another gem was the belief that the A-bomb would cause all the nitrogen in the atmosphere to fuse, killing everyone and everything on Earth. Some have espoused the belief that the Large Hadron Collider would produce microscopic black holes that would swallow the Earth.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note60uw4');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note60uw4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note60uw4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">While such subatomic-mass black holes are hypothetically possible, their lifetimes would be far too short to swallow anything; Hawking radiation would cause them to evaporate in less than a nanosecond.</span>
</li><li> It's just as well that the prevailing winds were not blowing when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> exploded. If they had been, the radiation would have blown south over Kiev, making that city uninhabitable. Although the explosion ruined large swathes of Belarusian and Ukrainian countryside, caused the abandonment of one town, Pripyat, and has caused cancer in many people, the city escaped largely unharmed. The danger is still present, though, as large wooded areas were likewise irradiated. Most of those trees are now dead and dry. Forest fires are now a real threat, once again raising the possibility of radioactive smoke blowing into a populated area.
</li><li> Many contemporary and not-so-contemporary sources have stated that the 1666 Great Fire of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/London">London</a>, an infamous disaster which leveled about 90% of the city and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">even managed to purge it from the last great plague epidemic</a>, killed no more than <em>eight</em> to <em>twenty</em> people, in <em>total</em>. Some have attributed to things such as Stuart-era London's above-average fire alert system, but even then, this death toll seems to be an extraordinarily generous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">Understatement</a> for a Renaissance city of 200,000.

</li><li> A recent discussion on a professional military historians' bulletin board tried to ascertain the existence of any statistics for civilians deaths caused by bullets, shrapnel, and aircraft parts falling out of the sky during a dogfight. While no contributor could answer the question, many observed that the Japanese and Germans used to collect aluminum from crashed aircraft and steel splinters from flak shells for recycling. The Americans used drop tanks (external fuel tanks for the extra range that could be jettisoned before combat to increase maneuverability) made out of paper after they realized the Germans were collecting the original metal tanks to ease their shortages.
</li><li> There have been numerous incidents in which people on the ground have been killed or injured when a plane crashes (this does not include purposely kamikaze or terrorist crashes â€” it happens all too often even in legitimate accidents).
</li><li> Prior to the European colonization of the Americas, total indigenous population of North and South America was quite large â€” anywhere from 50 to 100 million. After contact with Europeans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">viruses and bacteria</a> brought over from the Old World ran rampant across the New, with the result that the total indigenous population dropped to only about 9 million by the seventeenth century. North America was particularly hard-hit, with mortality rates reaching 90% in some areas, leaving whole regions that had once been home to large agricultural villages and small city-states to return to wilderness. The change was so drastic it even had an effect on world climate patterns- it's now believed that the Little Ice Age was caused by a sudden expansion of North American forests greater than the area of modern France that occurred as a result of the continent's sudden crash in population. This history did not until recently get much discussed in the history books.
</li><li> Floods and other consequences of the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishWeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishWeather">British Weather</a> tend to invoke this effect; property damage always ends up running into the hundreds of millions but actual <em>deaths</em> tend to be in the single digits, usually boat-owners or motorists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">with more valour than discretion</a> or some unlucky soul who has a tree fall on their car.

</li><li> The Chelyabinsk meteor impact in Russia in 2013. The town was devastated, and over 1000 people were injured, but nobody was actually <em>killed.</em> Dumb luck.
