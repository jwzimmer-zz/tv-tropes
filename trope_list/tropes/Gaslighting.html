You move their things, transmit noises into their room when no one else is there, change little details about your dress behind their back and so on. Or you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">start acting drastically differently than you usually do</a>. When they confront you about it, you claim to have no idea what theyre talking about and feign concern for their memory and mental health. Soon they are convinced that they are hearing voices, seeing dead people, hallucinating or whatever. The victim can become so convinced that they are going insane that they actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">do</a></em> go crazy.

The goal for the abuser is to trick the victim into doubting their own sound judgement and perception at every turn, which usually serves a two-folded purpose. Firstly to make the victim susceptible to the idea that if the abuser commits a violent or other criminal/transgressional act on them, it didn't actually happen, just like the other things the abuser denied happened. Secondly, if the victim can be persuaded that they are not of sound mind and only the abuser is capable of seeing the truth, they can be fooled into depending on the abuser to tell them what's real and what's not. In short, the abuser is able to both cover their crimes and gain the victim's captive loyalty by telling them a convincing lie enough times that their word becomes "the truth".

They actually get her doubting herself to the point that she begins trying to hug and kiss Jughead who, being the girl-hater that he is, <em>swiftly</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">gets the heck out of there in disgust</a>. Then Archie is left alone with Veronica, wearing an evil grin, asking, "Have you ever heard of a movie called <em>Gaslight</em>?"
</li><li> Master illusionist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril">Doctor Tzin-Tzin</a> tries to do this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> in the classic story "The House That Haunted Batman." He fails.
</li><li> The organization of wealthy gamblers The Black Glove led by Simon Hurt try to drive Batman to his mental breaking point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanRIP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanRIP">Batman R.I.P.</a></em>. They actually succeed, leaving them at the mercy of Batman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessThroughInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessThroughInsanity">Success Through Insanity</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">backup personality</a> The Batman of Zur En Arrh.
</li><li> The Joker tries this on James Gordon during the events of <em>Batman Endgame</em> by doctoring himself into several photos, such as an old newspaper about a fire in a hospital, and another where he can be seen in the background of a photo taken after the birth of Barbara and James Jr. Bonus stories at the end of each issue show that he also attempted this on (already unhinged) Arkham patients...and succeeded. He is going out of his way to make himself appear as a bogeyman, taking the "monster" part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Monster Clown</a> quite seriously.
</li><li> In Mysterio's second appearance in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> comics, he poses as a psychologist and nearly convinces Peter Parker that the strain of a secret identity is driving him crazy and that revealing this identity to the friendly psychologist would cure it all... the changes were not terribly subtle though. More things like Peter walking in to the office to find the room was upside down, including the psychologist.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkVictory">Dark Victory</a></em> (sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween">The Long Halloween</a></em>) had Alberto Falcone get out of Arkham, only to become convinced that his home is haunted by the ghost of his father when he keeps hearing voices, and even receives a gun like the kind the Holiday Killer used. When he reports this to his siblings they think he's nuts, but it's actually the Calendar Man who has been talking to him through hidden speakers throughout the house in an attempt to drive him to kill.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano">The Beano</a></em>, in a Roger the Dodger strip, Roger wants a day at the beach but his parents won't agree to it, so he gaslights them by putting washing back in the washing machine and bringing back books that his father already returned to the library so they think they're getting stressed and agree to it. When his dad realises what Roger's been doing by checking the date the book was checked out on (that day, rather than whenever he'd originally checked it out), they turn the tables and gaslight Roger by going full circle around a roundabout on their way to the beach, telling him they've already been and are just coming back.
</li><li> In an early Peter Milligan comic for Vertigo, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Enigma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Enigma">Enigma</a></em>, there's a supervillain team called the Interior League whose modus operandi is gaslighting. Specifically, they break into your house while you're out/sleeping, and rearrange the furniture into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">exact right positions</a> to turn you into a homicidal maniac.

He kept this up for <em>months</em>. His powers allowed him to do things like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">plant the remains of Murdock's father on Matt's desk and teleport his institutionalized ex-wife to his bedroom and back to the asylum before anyone noticed she was gone</span>. It didn't help that Matt's friends already thought he was going nuts because he was trying very hard to act happy in the face of all of the tragedy in his life.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye">Transformers: More than Meets the Eye</a></em>, the motormouth Autobot Swerve brags about doing this to his roommate, the paranoid security chief Red Alert, just to make him freak out. He then says he's going to wheel Red Alert into a different room while he's offline recharging. Given that Red Alert is known for being paranoid and <em>violent</em>, this just serves to cement Swerve's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a> status.
</li><li> An <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ECComics">EC Comics</a></em> story subverted this with a story in which a woman believes she is losing her mind after the death of her young son.

</li><li> The Italian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse">Mickey Mouse</a> story <em>Mickey and the visionary syndrome</em> (1997) features a particularly elaborate one. The story opens with Mickey, in detective mode, trying to capture a duo of industrial spies. He falls from a considerable height and suffers a concussion. For a while, he is delirious. The spies are apprehended by the police and Mickey is to be the key witness in their trial. When Mickey is released from the hospital, he is still in poor health and unable to fully care for himself. Conveniently, a previously unknown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse">Country Mouse</a> cousin drops by for a visit and offers to move in with him for a while. The cousin takes over all the housework and even volunteers to do repairs in neglected areas of Mickey's household. A few weeks later, Mickey feels fine enough to go out for a walk with the cousin. The cousin soon seems to vanish into thin air, and with him, all the improvements he made to Mickey's house. Mickey's family denies the existence of this mysterious cousin and no associate of Mickey remembers meeting him, only hearing Mickey mention him in phone conversations. Everyone concludes that Mickey has not recovered from his concussion and suffers from hallucinations. His allies in the police lose all faith in him, he is discredited as a trial witness, and Mickey genuinely starts doubting his own sanity. Then he notices an overlooked detail in his house and starts figuring out what happened. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The overlooked detail was a rope knot performed by the cousin which failed to vanish with the other improvements. He soon figures out that "the cousin" was a con-artist connected to the industrial spies. The entire gaslighting operation was intended to have the case against them collapse before the beginning of their trial. During his stay, the cousin claimed shyness to avoid meeting any of Mickey's associates. He orchestrated his own disappearance, while his accomplices were working hard to undo the improvements and repairs in Mickey's residence.</span>

This is not surprising, for a show that uses a villain with mind-controlling powers as an explicit metaphor for domestic abuse. At various times, first season villain (and Jessica's former abuser) Kilgrave attempts to confuse and distort Jessica's reality not with his actual mind-control powers, but simply by retelling the story of their relationship from a delusional perspective, that he insists on in the face of Jessica's own memories. Similarly, we see other characters such as Trish deal with this tactic from her mother. Interestingly, Jessica Jones doesn't simply demonstrate realistic gaslighting and its psychological effects alone, but shows its characters combating the technique by re-asserting their own stories. A recurring theme has Jessica reciting the names of streets she knew from the neighbourhood she once lived in, part of a psychological technique sometimes used by victims of abuse to have something concrete to hold onto that is outside of the warped reality insisted on by their Kilgrave.
</li><li> Used on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RemingtonSteele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RemingtonSteele">Remington Steele</a></em> as Steele and Laurel pull a scheme to force a murderer to confess.

Alex protests and says it's wrong, while Jane (who does it so often to her husband he's one MRI away from a free MRI) uses it very often, to crazy extremes in this episode.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CornerGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CornerGas">Corner Gas</a></em> had the entire cast, mostly Brent and Emma, do this in order to make Oscar think his memory was failing him in his old age.

Kind of mean, since the social worker wasn't being unreasonable, she just happened to visit the Summers' house on a really bad day... which is probably every day around there...
</li><li> Season 6 also played this for drama at one point, with Spike convincing the already severely depressive Buffy that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a>, and is thus inherently evil. Buffy ends up telling Tara (who was also gaslighted into thinking she was inherently evil for a long time) about this, and she convinced Buffy that it's false. Interestingly, this is a plot point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> avoided answering.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>, apparently convincing someone and her friends that she is insane and hallucinating will ensure that you can murder someone using a method she devised and not get caught. After all, if an insane woman says she knows how a murder was carried out, there's no reason to even test the theory.
<ul><li> Inverted only to be played straight in "Mr. Monk Goes to the Asylum", where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Lancaster dresses as Santa Claus to gain entry to a chimney in a mental institution to retrieve the gun he used a few years ago to shoot and kill a rival doctor at the institution, because he knows the patient in the room overlooking his route is obsessed with Santa Claus and won't be believed</span>. Unfortunately, Dr. Lancaster's plan backfired when he was forced to abandon the search because one of the patients was throwing a fit, and he apparently didn't anticipate that the patient in question would actually photograph him or that Monk would start investigating. As an emergency fix, he makes things seem as though Monk and the patient in question were becoming insane (or in the case of the patient, more insane than he already was), such as stealing the camera as well as rags from his Santa suit that Monk discovered, stealing a fellow inmate's necklace and somehow planting it on Monk to make it seem as though he stole it, and replacing pictures he drew with more disturbing pictures.
</li><li> This seems to be happening to Sharona in "Mr Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf", providing the first example.
</li><li> In "Mr. Monk Goes to the Dentist", there is an episode-length use of this trope: Randy is undergoing a dental operation at Dr. Bloom's to remove an infected tooth. During the operation, a bald man barges in and furiously demands that Dr. Bloom tell him what he's done with Barry Bonds, who is worth $13 million. A fight breaks out, with Dr. Bloom and his assistant Terri ultimately killing the intruder. When Randy comes around after his operation is over, he looks around and sees no signs that a fight ever happened, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because Dr. Bloom and Terri had dumped the body in the woods and also replaced broken equipment.</span> Everyone, Stottlemeyer included, dismisses Randy's claim as an affect of being under anasthetics at the time. When the victim's body does turn up, Randy identifies him as the man Dr. Bloom killed, but is laughed at by the other cops and quits in anger (Stottlemeyer theorizes to Randy that according to him, the intruder confronted Dr. Bloom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad">because he thought Dr. Bloom kidnapped Barry Bonds and they were arguing about the ransom money</a>). Randy only realizes that he wasn't hallucinating when he notices an article about the armored car robbery that the dead man, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Denny Jardeen</span>, had been involved in: in that robbery, armed men with pistols and rifles had hijacked an armored car, unloaded it at a warehouse, shot and killed both guards, and made off with $13 million in bearer bonds. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Randy realizes that one of the guards punched Jardeen in the face before he was shot, Jardeen had gone to Dr. Bloom's to get a broken tooth fixed, and divulged the location of the bonds to him and Terri while under anasthesia. The good doctors went to his house, found the money in a toolshed, but instead of turning the money in to the police, they kept it. When Jardeen figured out what happened to the bonds, he confronted Bloom about it, forcing Bloom and Terri to kill him. Randy misinterpreted "bearer" as "Barry", explaining the Barry Bonds discrepancy.</span>
</li><li> Another case happens to Monk in "Mr. Monk Is Up All Night": Suffering from insomnia, Monk is wandering through the streets, and happens to pass by a diner kitchen where he hears an argument going on. He peeks through a window and sees a drug deal going bad, with the dealer and customer debating if a third man at the deal, an Asian, is actually a cop or not. Suddenly, the Asian pulls a badge and gun and declares the other two men under arrest. Monk looks away as the drug dealer attacks the undercover cop, only to hear a gunshot. He looks and sees the drug dealer has shot and killed the cop (and blood has splattered everywhere). The dealer hustles the customer into a waiting car that speeds away. But when the police arrive, however, the kitchen (which was destroyed in the fight) is spotless and immaculate, and there is no evidence that a murder happened, not even a body to prove a thing, and no cops have been reported missing. Monk later finds the supposed "undercover cop" at a train station, but he denies ever having been to the diner. He also locates the customer, a coin dealer, who denies ever having been there. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The apparent murder was an elaborate con by the Asian and "drug dealer" to steal the coin dealer's merchandise, tricking him into thinking he had witnessed a murder and was paying them hush money. The reason why the kitchen was spotless is because a waitress at the restaurant helped the Asian clean up the kitchen before the cops arrived.</span>

</li><li> Used in retrospect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>. The original plan was just to convince their target (an abusive and politically connected ex-husband) that people were trying to kill him, to get him to leave town. Unfortunately, his mobster brother wouldn't <em>let</em> him run, so they did some quick stepping to make it look like the whole thing was a series of paranoid hallucinations, presumably getting him committed in the end. Features an awesome performance by Michael as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Catholic priest.</span> Conversation between Michael and Sam suggests this technique is a standard spy technique, particularly for targets with a history of substance abuse.

</li><li> "The Three Days of the Hunter Job" has the team target a tabloid TV reporter and make her think she's stumbled upon a conspiracy theory involving terrorists and when that isn't enough, ups the ante without much effort. The episode gets extra points when the team convinces the reporter that there's a chemical in the water supply, and give her pills to counteract it — pills that turn out to be anti-psychotic meds. Guess what happens when she interrupts a broadcast for "breaking news" and her producers tackle her...
</li><li> "The Morning After Job" may take the prize. The team convinced a protected federal witness that he had <em>killed his one-night stand,</em> played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Parker</a>, to convince him to give them evidence against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Moreau. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">The plan goes awry</a>, so they end up bringing Parker into the courtroom when he's about to give his testimony and escape all consequences for his actions.

<ul><li> That show loved this trope. There's another point in that episode where he pays off an <em>entire restaurant</em> to use Monopoly money instead of cash, much to the horrified confusion of the victim. Then, to drive the nail home, he has them switch back to real money when the victim is in the bathroom, then back <em>again</em> when he goes to pick up the check. It works beautifully.

</li><li> Years before that, Michael Martin gaslighted his stepmother Julie Martin; he always blamed her for breaking up his mum and dad's marriage, driving his mum to alcoholism and later death in a car crash. Michael proceeded to gaslight Julie by moving objects around the home (or hiding them), pretending he hadn't talked to her about things (or alternately, pretending to have talked to her when he hadn't), and altering her dosage of tranquilisers. By the end, he had her convinced she was insane, including leaving the house and running around the back to make it appear that there was more than one of him, and was only caught out because he got too cocky.
</li><li> Used and namechecked in a 2015 story arc which again involved a (former) Hoyland and a Robinson. When Stephanie Scully returned after two years in a mental hospital, she quickly befriended Paul's daughter Amy and grandson Jimmy. Paul, concerned for Jimmy's safety (and possibly still carrying a grudge over Steph's involvement in the death of Ringo Brown), attempted to make her doubt her sanity again and force her to return to the hospital, using information he learned from Steph's psychiatric nurse/ex-girlfriend Belinda.

To get rid of the social worker, Nina yells at her and pretends that the worker was negligent and irresponsible and basically tricks her into thinking leaving the house in peace was a <em>favor</em>. To be fair it was really important that "Uncle Billy" stay with them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since they were the only ones who knew he was a murderous vampire</span> and everyone felt <em>really</em> bad about driving the social worker to tears.

Chilton planted the idea in Gideon's head that he is actually the Chesapeake Ripper, a serial killer whose murders stopped around the time Gideon was locked up. It's so effective that even when Gideon discovers he's been gaslit, he still isn't entirely sure he's not the Ripper. When Alana Bloom calls Chilton out on this it's implied that he realized what was going on but decided to play along to keep the renown from being the psychiatrist to someone as famous as The Ripper.
</li><li> Also throughout season 1 Hannibal turns out to have been doing this to Will Graham, with his ultimate goal being to convince Will he's a serial killer and mold him into an apprentice.

Pierce yells back that he's sick of them all treating him like some kind of joke, citing their pathetic attempt at this and expecting him to buy it as one of the examples. They look suitably shamed (although they also point out that Pierce's treatment of <em>them</em> in turn kind of justifies their treatment of him).
</li><li> Dr. Heidi tries to do this and convince the study group that Greendale Community College isn't real and they were all inmates at "Greendale Asylum".

Basically, this is altering circumstances to force another character to take a Madness check. Naturally, this is an evil act, and doing this to anyone for any reason always attracts the attentions of the Dark Powers.

Unlike most effects of this nature, for which the culprit tends to be fairly obvious once the effect has expired (it was that guy who was pointing at me saying magic words right before), due to the nature of their hypnotic stare and psychic magic, they can do this without the victim being aware they're doing any of it.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ProblemSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ProblemSleuth">Problem Sleuth</a></em>, the running gag was that an innocious-looking item would inexplicably turn into a dangerous item when called on and be treated as if it was always this way.

This one ultimately was played with; savvy players eventually cottoned on and would call the wrong item to use the one they were actually aiming for.

The best example is probably the episode "Pink Campaign", where Pink Panther gets revenge on a lumberjack Little Man who cut down his tree house, by stealing the Little Man's entire house piece by piece, taking the front door, the back porch steps, couch, TV set, chimney and fireplace, the outside walls, bathroom sink and medicine chest, and the roof, with only the foundation remaining.

</li><li> Two episode of <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a> Show</em> has this as the villain's plot:

This is a rare case where the ones doing the gaslighting are portrayed as the heroes.
<ul><li> In "Pickles", Bubble Bass ends up gaslighting SpongeBob by complaining that SpongeBob forgot the pickles on his order, while hiding them under his tongue the entire time. This briefly drives SpongeBob into insanity, and not only is he convinced that he can't remember how to make a Krabby Patty, but he also forgets basic tasks such as how to dress, arrange his house, go to bed, and even put words together properly.

Not knowing she's really Jerrica, they fabricate pictures and movies of Jem as a little girl, and the impostors pretend to have known her as Jem since childhood. The ridiculousness of seeing an alternate past that her friends and family seem to believe is what really happened leads Jem to a mental breakdown.
</li><li> Similarly, this unintentionally happens in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> episode "Insane in the Mainframe" when Fry is sent to a robot insane asylum by a careless judge.

</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> episode has Hank noticing that someone is subtly rearranging furniture and drinking his grapefruit juice while he's gone.

<ul><li> "Balooest of Blues" has a variation; Baloo inherited a gigantic mansion, including a butler and cook. He stays the night with his friends, only to constantly feel like statues suddenly turned his way, images looking the other way and sometimes signs of assassination attempts such as axes or arrows being dangerously close to his head once he turns around. He switches rooms with the others multiple times to ensure he is just imagining things which doesn't help. Nobody believes him until he actually ends up injured. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The butler and cook try to murder him since he is the last inheritor before the mansion goes to them</span>.
</li><li> "The Idol Rich" plays it straighter. Baloo and Kit find a rare idol worth millions. However, it is soon stolen from them by Colonel Spigot and the Vembrians.

He undermines their self-esteem and confidence in their selves and abilities, while never fully being honest to them about how much he needs them. "Morty's Mind Blowers" makes this clear when it's revealed that he chooses to delete the memories of Morty, as well as Jerry, as and when he sees fit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Notably, the memory vials that are red in colour, are memories where Morty pointed out Rick's mistakes, which he chooses to delete solely to maintain his authority over him</span>.

This time, the culprit is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Magica</span> who is trying to get Lena to give her magic back. Yet again, it nearly worked.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em> features villain Lord Viren indirectly ordering his son Soren <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to kill a pair of princes in order to seize control of the throne they're in line to occupy</span> in the first season. Much later, towards the beginning of season 3, when Soren brings up these orders in front of his father and sister, the former vehemently denies them, claims his son is easily confused and not very bright, and trusts in him even less from that point on.

</li><li> A British mental health organisation managed to do this by accident when they ran a series of banner ads on various websites (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>) in order to increase awareness about various mental health issues. One of the banner ads was about paranoia, and it involved playing constant, quiet whispers over the speakers/headphones that were alternatingly insulting and indistinct, until the user rolled their mouse cursor over the advert. Some people, however, did not notice the advert and were genuinely disturbed by the effect, thinking they really <em>were</em> hearing voices.
</li><li> One of hobbies of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MansonFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MansonFamily">Manson Family</a> was to break into people's houses and rearrange all of their furniture, most likely used as a terror tactic to start their global race war.

Needless to say, the Stasi were quite effective.
</li><li> It has been alleged that this tactic is still used to discredit people who get too vocal about causes and irritate agents of the grouping or nation thay are active against. Of course people alleging this can then be dismissed, without hard proof, as paranoid, flaky or mentally deranged — which also discredits the cause they are campaigning for, by association.

</li><li> In the mid 90s, a paraplegic Australian athlete told an anecdote about getting drunk with a blind friend of his. His friend thought it would be funny to slash the tires of his wheelchair; he retaliated by rearranging the man's furniture.
</li><li> Gaslighting is a tactic often used by crafty domestic abusers to tie partners down to their relationship; by re-arranging things, getting items "lost", and saying events happened differently than remembered, they create the sense that the victim has no idea how to handle their own life and needs to depend on the abuser to help them survive because they doubt that they could survive on their own.
<ul><li> Abusers don't even have to be that crafty. One of the reasons partners have trouble leaving abusers is that they have been gaslit to believe that the abuse they are suffering is actually their fault, the cliched line "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidYouMakeMeHitYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidYouMakeMeHitYou">Why did you make me do that to you</a>?" sums up the situation in a nutshell.
</li><li> A common gaslighting tactic by abusers is threatening to harm themselves, or even threatening suicide, if their partner leaves them/does not listen to them. This is known as "emotional blackmail" by psychologist Susan Forward.
</li></ul></li><li> A mild humorous example. Critic Alexander Woollcott had a portrait of himself he was very fond of. A couple fellow Algonquin Round Table members had a series of near-duplicates made with details just a tiny bit askew. For months they would periodically swap in a new duplicate and query, "Alex, whatever is happening to that painting?"
