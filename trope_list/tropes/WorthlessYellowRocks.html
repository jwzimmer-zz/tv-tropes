But, due to ignorance, stupidity or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> in its most literal application, they discard it as worthless junk. The audience groans in disbelief as earthly wealth beyond their wildest dreams is left lying on the floor (if not thoughtlessly trampled upon). Alternatively, while they might find some use for it that use is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">mundane, insultingly boring utility</a> that is far below its actual value and capability.
</p><p>Finding gold is the most common example of this trope: Though it has industrial applications as a highly corrosion-resistant electrical conductor and potential as a cheaper alternative to platinum catalysts, almost all of gold's value is due to its rarity (the pretty shine doesn't hurt either). And, in a disaster situation, gold would quickly prove to be worthless after all. This can lead to an ironic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByMaterialism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByMaterialism">Death by Materialism</a> situation for someone who's "smart" enough to figure out what those funny yellow rocks really are and won't abandon them when they really should be running for the door.

(Ironically, aluminium actually was more valuable than gold once; see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section below.) Of course, given what science knows about the formation of elements, it is highly unlikely that there are any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfGold">solid-gold planets</a> out there, no matter how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">amazing</a> it would be. On the other hand, there <em>is</em> a giant space-diamond. Probably a whole lot of them.
</p><p>There is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for the reasoning behind this trope. There is a law of economics where materials decrease in value as they become more abundant. (Refer to the above paragraph.) Trade in general, when done honestly, is fundamentally what happens when two people come together and agree that something the other guy has is more valuable to them than something they can afford to give away.

For that matter, they aren't <em>that</em> rare now (about as common as rubies, which have a much lower market price); their perceived value is mostly a combination of enforced artificial scarcity and sucker-rearing by the distribution companies.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>, Senshi sees little value in anything that isn't directly related to cooking. He tells Marcille and Chilchuck to throw out a bunch of "inedible treasure bugs," only mentioning offhand that they are actual pieces of treasure. Not long after that, Laius notes that treasure bugs in good condition can sell for a lot of money to insect collectors, which gets Marcille and Chilchuck very annoyed that he didn't tell them this before they ate them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>, Nana burns thousands of yen on the beach for warmth on a cold night due to never having experienced the world outside the laboratory where she was used as a test subject. She then has nightmares of being crucified while naked at the hands of vengeful money-people, thanks to Mayu.
</li><li> Taken in all directions in the manga and anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a>.</em> Hidden in the Skypeian island of Upperyard is an entire <em>city</em> of gold. The natives of Skypeia, where otherwise people live on clouds and there is no natural soil, find the dirt of the originally blue-sea island itself far more valuable than any gold. The arc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">God Eneru</a>, <em>does</em> have a use for the gold; however, it's of no monetary value to him, either. He instead uses its conductive properties to enhance his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">lightning-based powers</a>. Finally, our heroes, the Straw Hat Pirates, <em>do</em> value the gold for its monetary worth, and make plans to steal what Eneru didn't make off with. The Skypeians actually intend to <em>let</em> the Straw Hats have all the gold they want in gratitude of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s defeat, but the Straw Hats (believing they were stealing the gold) misinterpret this as their being caught and run away with only what they were carrying, when they could have gotten far more just by waiting. Notably, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePiratesWhoDontDoAnything">this is the only time they've ever actually stolen something</a> (as a crew, anyway; Nami is another story) before or after this point. The reverse is also seen: rubber doesn't exist in Skypeia, and after Luffy's rubber powers defeat Eneru, it becomes insanely valuable. Thus, Usopp is able to trade rubber bands for dials, which are common to Skypeia but don't exist on the Blue Sea.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JuuniSenshiBakuretsuEtoRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JuuniSenshiBakuretsuEtoRanger">Juuni Senshi Bakuretsu Eto Ranger</a></em>, the Novel World of <em>The Honest Woodcutter</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FracturedFairyTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FracturedFairyTale">Fractured</a> to where there were entire deserts of gold.

</li><li> While it's not gold, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate</a> is told to spend a few (3) days away from the mansion because Nagi's embarrassed, he's given one million yen (~$11,000 US, £8,000). Which he promptly loses. It gets returned to the mansion and Maria counts it, stating that it's almost exactly what he was given for living expenses. Nagi passes by the table and asks what all the chump change is. The characters, especially Maria and Nagi, have continually shown disdain for the value of money. Such that it's a huge leap in Nagi's show of maturity when she's willing to give it up.
</li><li> Episode 4 of <em>Space Symphony Maetel</em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a> land on a planet where gold is worthless yellow rocks, but cotton is very valuable.

Outraged, Dante asks him where he expects to spend it in Hell. His father attacks him anyway.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonColleKnights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonColleKnights">Mon Colle Knights</a></em>, Prince Eccentro, esteemed, rich snob of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">"Monster Item"</a> hunter, went digging through piles of gold, jewels and treasure, lamenting that he couldn't find anything valuable. He does eventually find something that makes his doggy digging pals quote excited. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's a cookbook...</span>
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em>, which has iron pyrite (also known as <em>fool's gold</em>) suddenly becoming incredibly valuable in one town, mostly due to some economic manipulation among the merchants.

<ul><li> Goku didn't understand money at first. When told you can trade it for things like food, he under or overestimates what things cost.
</li><li> Buu makes this mistake in the epilogue as well: he wants to get ice cream, but is told he needs to pay for it. Buu accidentally wins some money in a street fight, and comes back to exchange it for his ice cream. The clerk tries to tell him it's way too much, but Buu ignores him, insisting "You keep money!

There, he meets an alien who claims to be the moon's owner. Scrooge tries to haggle, and learns that the alien will trade the deed of ownership for the moon in exchange for a <em>handful of dirt</em>. After being floored by this unnaturally good bargain, Scrooge does so (Donald brought a shoebox full of dirt so he could "keep his feet on the ground") during the trip; the alien feeds the dirt into a machine that soon creates a rapidly-growing planet, with weather patterns and capable of supporting life.

The Modsva live in massive "disk cities" made out of old asteroids that survived their sun's expansion into a Red Supergiant. Since all the system's planets were destroyed, and every last bit of the original asteroids where mined out and used to build the disk cities, the only way the Modsva, lacking FTL travel, can gain new resources is to mine their sun for hydrogen and then use fusion to transform it into other elements. Since Iron is the heaviest element that can be created without a supernova, it's considered the most valuable, with one character proclaiming that an FTL drive would be worth more than "The sun's mass in iron". However, since carbon is much easier to create through fusion, and the Modsva have the industrial capacity to convert it into diamond, it's commonly used in a number of Modsva technologies, with Iron being limited to the upper class.

Scott Savage's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Farworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Farworld">Farworld</a></em> series place value on an object because of its craftsmanship. An old boot holds equal value to an expensive necklace (or at least, they are judged against each other based on craftsmanship, and not the obvious value), where a lump of gold is just a shiny rock. While this much is understandable, they go on to confound the other characters as well as the reader when they show that they would rather throw a 'valuable' item back into the water than give it to someone without compensation, regardless of whether or not they were ever going to keep the objects.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecondJungleBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecondJungleBook">The Second Jungle Book</a></em>, the story "The King's Ankus" involves Mowgli coming upon a huge treasure guarded by a cobra. Unimpressed by the gems and gold in general, and with the cobra being without poison due to old age, he takes the only thing he finds useful - a short spear with a hook, made of something really strong and light - that just happens to be covered in gold and jewels. Not long afterwards, he learns it's an ivory <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_goad">ankus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - and is immediately so disgusted by a tool used for torturing elephants he throws it away, saying he doesn't want anything with Hathi's blood on it. Later, he and Bagheera find themselves tracking it down again - as the man who found it was killed to steal it, as was the thief, etc. To prevent further deaths Mowgli gives it back to the cobra and recommends it to find a young successor to guard the treasure.

This comes as a shock to Rincewind for two reasons: First, because if such a currency were ever implemented in Ankh-Morpork the Guild of Artificers would promptly become the (highly-successful) Guild of Forgers, and second, paper can't be <em>that</em> valuable... right?
<ul><li> Later, it's revealed that it is, in fact, about as in-demand (and thus as valuable) as it can be in a place where a corrupt, wasteful bureaucracy rules with an iron fist.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakingMoney">Making Money</a></em>, which introduces paper money to Ankh-Morpork anyways. Moist von Lipwig, as the new Master of the Mint, says the Bank has a pile of "useless metal" in the vaults that needs clearing out and that potatoes are worth more than gold if viewed dispassionately, since food will do much more in times of poverty than gold will in times of starvation. He also neatly sidesteps the counterfeiting issue pointed out above by employing the city's best stamp forger (since people have already begun using postage stamps as a <em>de facto</em> currency) to design the city's new banknotes.

Ankh-Morpork does extract some fat from animals, but with all the applications (cooking, candle-making, soap-making, industrial lubricants...) local production can't hope to meet the demand.

He's sensible enough to realize what would happen if this became public, so he instead colonizes the island with a small number of other families. They collect a boat-load of diamonds each year to sell off in secret, allowing them to live in luxury on the island. But on the island itself, the rocks are so common that diamond cuff links are simply given away.

After they come back to "civilization" some time later, they are told that it's a "fine and useful metal, but you buy it, you don't buy things with it." Ironically, the sellers want a "valuable" metal like... gold. Essentially, the saved-up germanium is only worth a fraction of what the travellers had expected.
</li><li> In one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold">Lois McMaster Bujold</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan</a></em> novels, Miles relates how at the end of the "Time of Isolation", when the planet Barrayar was rediscovered, one of his ancestors thought he could make a fortune by trading for precious stones with the galactics. The jewels were synthetic, the market was soon flooded and Miles's ancestor lost a fortune instead.
<ul><li> His mother Cordelia inverts it in an earlier book, wondering why the Barrayarans value gold so much when it's only vaguely useful in some electronic capacities.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3uz52');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3uz52" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3uz52');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ignoring the number one reason for gold's value, aside from rarity — it's <em>malleability</em> and softness. A single ounce of gold can be beaten into a sheet measuring roughly 5 meters on a side. You could do anything you wanted to gold — stretch it, beat it, melt it — and it retained its nature. This is why alchemists believed gold was linked to immortality.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</em>, Ivan and others are trapped in a slowly flooding room with many rare treasures. After rescue, Ivan describes it as spending the night "contemplating the true nature of wealth." However, at the end, the <em>barrells</em> of gold are considered worth a ton in Betan dollars. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> admitted in the aforementioned book, she should have realized that gold was rare universe-wide.

They use it to make portals and no other mineral will do, and if the people of Earth found out how valuable it was they would raise the price dramatically.
</li><li> There is a story of a man finding an island where diamonds and other precious jewels were very common, but the food was very bland. He happened to have some onions with him, which he traded (as well as teaching planting and growing techniques) for a small fortune in diamonds. Hearing of this success, another man found the island, and traded garlic for the most valuable thing the natives had. He returned home, opened the chest, and found it full of onions.
<ul><li> A similar story appears in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights">Arabian Nights</a> - a poor man went to the Caliph (who had never eaten poor men's food before) with a cart of onions. The Caliph loved them, and rewarded the poor man by filling his cart with gold. Another poor man had the idea - "if the great Caliph was so impressed by onions, what will happen when I introduce him to garlic?" The Caliph loved garlic too, and ordered the poor man to be rewarded by filling his cart with the greatest treasure in his kingdom... onions.
<ul><li> It is recorded, and as certain as anything else we know about Muhammad, that onions were his favorite food.
</li><li> In much of the Middle East, water and arable land are both precious commodities. Vegetables might really be worth more than gold in some places.

He finds it full of worthless scraps of paper and leaves. Only to be told in a tavern the next day of the owner's confusion at having come in the next morning to find someone had broken into his strong room, opened his safe, tossed all his <em>Bronze age paper money</em> in a pile on the floor and left.
<ul><li> In another of Eddings' series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em>, the Marag people were wiped out by the Tolnedrans (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Race of Hats</a> based on Imperial Rome and phenomenally greedy) ostensibly because of the Marag habit of ritualistic cannibalism, but largely because their streams were literally lined with gold. The Marags, having a barter economy and being phenomenally xenophobic, didn't care about the gold. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding">Karmic Twist Ending</a> of sorts, after the genocide, the Marags' gold-filled country becomes so overrun with vengeful ghosts that no one can set foot there without going insane.
</li><li> Belgarath also has a vast hoard of gold, which he mined himself, and which he almost never needs. Although he could create all the gold he wants, he doesn't do so, partly perhaps because it's less fun, but probably because doing so would gradually devalue the metal.
</li><li> Of course Belgarath also places a huge diamond <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">under a step in his tower</span> to see how long it would take to wear down to dust, then forgets he placed it there anyway.
</li><li> During their travels, Belgarath and Garion encounter an alchemist who <em>really can</em> turn lead into gold. Unfortunately, the chemicals he uses cost more than the gold is worth (he's trying to refine the process). While talking to him, they learn that a former colleague managed to turn glass into a substance that was as strong as steel, but still transparent. Belgarath points out to the alchemist that the materials for glass are literally dirt-cheap, and can be molded into any shape. A process that could make it unbreakable would be more valuable than all the gold in the world. The alchemist is suddenly <em>very</em> upset at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">missed opportunity</a>.
</li><li> In the David Eddings series <em>The Dreamers</em>, the four gods hire armies with gold, except for Aracia. Queen Trenicia of the Isle of Akalla won't accept gold- she refers to it as 'yellow lead' and took gems as payment instead.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em>Isaac Asimov's Robot City</em> series, the robots of the eponymous city see gold as a very weak metal, and mostly useless. They don't even need it for its utility as a conductor, since Asimov's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">positronics</a>" are said to be superior to mere electronics and instead employ a sponge of platinum-irridium alloy. However, seeing as how gold never corrodes, they ended up finding a use for it: eating utensils for the humans that visit.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTraders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTraders">The Traders</a></em>, a Terminus trader is surprised that some planet wants gold as ransom for a captured person - for him it is "old fashioned", although he has no trouble understanding the possible uses of this fact (he can synthesize significant amounts of it). Later, he is trying to convince a nobleman of that world to buy technology. He sells him a device to transform iron into gold as part of a blackmail scheme of the supposedly pious nobleman. The man is forced to buy all of the trader's goods at far more than their normal price (two shipfuls of <em>tin</em>) in order to keep video footage of him drooling over gold from being broadcast to the citizens. He later tells a friend how laughable it was because it's just not cost-effective to transmute metals, due to the excessive power consumption in the process. The Galactic Empire is shown to use <em>iridium</em> the way we use silver.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy1">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>, the Book muses at length about how most of the proposed solutions to Earth's unhappiness have involved the movement of small green pieces of paper. It considers this odd, as generally speaking, it isn't the small green pieces of paper who are unhappy. As brought up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRestaurantAtTheEndOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRestaurantAtTheEndOfTheUniverse">The Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a></em>, all forms of currency are ultimately proven to be either pointless or useless.
</li><li> Played with in <em>Aliens: The Other White Meat</em>. A dimensional traveler named Blackbeard found a universe where gold was so common as to be lying around on the ground, but chewing gum was viewed as an incredibly rare treasure. Naturally, his response was to buy large quantities of gum, transport them to that world, and make himself the richest man in history.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomTollbooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePhantomTollbooth">The Phantom Tollbooth</a></em> jewels are valued just like in the real world, except in Digitopolis. They only care about digging up numbers. Precious stones are tossed in the corner and are considered worse than dross. Of course our heroes realize their value, but are distracted by the arrival of lunch before they can even ask for some souvenirs.
</li><li> On a similar note, the underground folk from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair">The Silver Chair</a></em> do value gemstones, but only <em>fresh</em> ones that are filled with delicious juice. The hard, dry, inedible ones that surface-dwellers hoard are stale and tasteless, hence without value.

(Since at the time the value of currency was pegged to the value of gold, the devastating effects of a supply of cheap gold are quite believable). It is then up to the brave Communist heroes to foil his plot to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>. For those wondering, he got the gold by using his laser-like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a> to drill deep beneath the Earth's crust, where there is apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">an entire geological layer composed of gold mixed with mercury</a>.
</li><li> In <em>The Water Trader's Dream</em>, a poem by Robert Priest, aliens trade gold and jewels for water on Earth, a scare and valuable commodity in the galaxy (!).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Conqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Conqueror">Wolf of the Plains</a></em>, when Wen Chao attempts to recruit the Mongols as mercenaries to fight the Tartars, he offers Temujin (the future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a>) gold. Temujin turns him down and demands a more useful payment instead - swords, bows, and armour.
<ul><li> In the second book, <em>Lords of the Bow</em>, 'Ma Tsin' tries to bribe Temuge into persuading Genghis Khan to lift the siege of Yenking. He fails, because Temuge finds the idea of exchanging a horse for a bag of metal, which can then be exchanged for another horse, ridiculous.
</li></ul></li><li> In H. B. Fyfe's "In Value Deceived", an alien exploration starship is searching for a way to alleviate the famine on their home world. They make first contact with a human starship on some barren little world. On a tour of the human's ship, they are thunderstruck when they see the hydroponic installations. It's the key to salvation for their people! But of course they feign disinterest. They ask for one as a souvenir. They don't notice the similar disinterest with which the humans ask for an alien heating unit. The one that produces all that pesky ash. Stuff like uranium and gold nuggets. Both aliens and humans are surprised when both parties make quick good-byes after the trade and take off before the trade is regretted. They both think "gee, the other guys act like they cheated us."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</a></em>, the heroes discover a small fortune in sunken gold plates. Due to the unusual legal situation they're in, they treat the gold as more of a <em>liability</em> than an asset. However, a reader who has also read the prequels knows that the sheets are giant punch cards from a failed attempt at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> computer, not to mention <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an unknown isotope of gold that is the key to immortality.</span>

<ul><li> In one of the later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em> novels, the hero rescues a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl">Beautiful Slave Girl</a> and has to explain to her that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiamondsInTheBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiamondsInTheBuff">jewels she is wearing</a> are worth a considerable amount.
</li></ul></li><li> Shifted a few preciousness brackets over in Raymond E. Feist's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiftwarCycle">Riftwar Cycle</a></em>. Midkemia (standard medieval-but-with-magic Earth-clone) is invaded by the Tsurani (vaguely-Pan-Asian-but-mostly-Japanese medieval-but-with-magic Earth-clone) for its <em>metal</em>. Their home world, Kelewan, is an old world which was previously inhabited by at least two intelligent races, who mined out all the metals. Silver used to pay for a meal in a tavern on Midkemia could support a Tsurani family for a year. At the same time, the small, low-quality gems used in lieu of large-denomination coins on Tsuranuanni are so valuable on Midkemia that a Tsurani noble's modest travel chest is enough to set him up comfortably for the rest of his life.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> novel <em>The Veiled Threat</em>, Starscream is shown to be bribing terrorists by using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">internal matter converter</a> to produce massive amounts of gold coins. The other Decepticons are baffled that the loyalties of humans can be won by such simple and, from their perspective, worthless bits of metal. They claim that Cybertronians are superior as they only value what is useful for continued functioning, like energon. Considering the behavior of some of the human terrorists within the novel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">they may be right</a>.

"Makes more sense than gold," Grakker comments (rather condescendingly) to Rod. "Not much you can do with gold once you've got it."
</li><li> In Nick Hornby's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HighFidelity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HighFidelity">High Fidelity</a></em>, Rob is contacted by a woman who wants to sell an entire collection of rare and valuable records for a pittance. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that the woman's husband just left her for his much-younger secretary, and asked his wife to sell the collection to finance his new life with the secretary.

They end up giving away (there are rules against trading without a license, but the right to give presents is sacred) stimulants, threatening the stability of the system and forcing the ruling monopolists to bribe them with enough money to survive until they can go back to Earth.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwordOfTruth">The Sword of Truth</a></em>, the Mud People have gold treasuries (and possibly mines) on their territory, but consider it worthless because it's too soft for spears.
</li><li> Thomas More's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Utopia">Utopia</a></em> points out the bad logic of assigning "value" to things just because they're pretty and rare. In Utopia, they have the stuff and use it to trade to the outside world, but within Utopia, it's communally owned and growing attached to it is discouraged. Gold is used for the shackles of slaves and for things like chamber pots, so that it's associated with the shameful and dirty. Precious stones are given to small children to wear and play with, with the understanding that any self-respecting Utopian will quickly grow out of this infantile attachment to the shiny if they want to be taken seriously — so if any foreigners ever arrive all pimped out in their most ostentatious jewelry in an attempt to impress the locals, they'll look like overgrown babies. In one case a foreign king visting Utopia is mistaken for a slave due to having a gold necklace around his neck. A group of watching Utopians comment on the scene with one saying "that chain hardly looks big enough to prevent that slave from escaping." Since he's also wearing many jewels, which their society veiws as absurd and childish for an adult, they concluded he's some kind of clown. One of the king's servants, who is dressed in normal clothes, is mistaken for the foreign king because he's the only one not wearing gold or jewels, and therefore the only one respectable enough to even be considered the ruler of such a powerful nation.
</li><li> The "disaster situation" applies in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RobinsonCrusoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RobinsonCrusoe">Robinson Crusoe</a></em>: In chapter five, Robinson is stranded on a desert island with no other human being. He needs every tool he can get, things like razors, scissors, knives, and forks are precious, but then he writes: <em>I found about Thirty six Pounds value in Money, some European Coin, some Brazil, some Pieces of Eight, some Gold, some Silver. I smil'd to my self at the Sight of this Money, O Drug Said I aloud, what art thou good for, Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off of the Ground, one of those Knives is worth all this Heap, I have no Manner of use for thee, e'en remain where thou art, and go to the Bottom as a Creature whose Life is not worth saving. However, upon Second Thoughts, I took it away,</em> Robinson knows the value, but those treasures are really only worthless yellow rocks if there is not a society to give them value.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge">The Diamond Age</a></em>, the most valuable items are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyElectricSheepAreCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyElectricSheepAreCheap">things that are handmade</a>, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator">ready access to nanotechnology</a>.

</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithLaumer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeithLaumer">Keith Laumer</a>'s stories had diplomat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Retief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Retief">Retief</a> make a deal with an alien who could provide amphibious construction workers. The alien said his people were skilled craftsmen, who had to bring along the materials they knew and loved: gold, diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and granite. Retief okayed the gold and jewels, but said to hold the granite, and the alien was pleased at his generosity, "accepting the stuff we got a surplus of, and foregoing the rare and expensive granite."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/The13Clocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/The13Clocks">The 13 Clocks</a></em> featured a woman who was cursed to cry jewels - once word spread about her, people came from far and wide to tell her sad stories and make her cry. Unfortunately, over time she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">flooded</a> the economy with jewels and her town collapsed once cobblestones became more valuable than jewelry.
</li><li> In the picture book <em>The Littlest Angel</em>, all the angels in Heaven are asked to bring gifts for the birth of Jesus Christ, the best of which will become the Star of Bethlehem. The titular angel, a small boy, brings a box of his earthly possessions from when he was human: a broken dog collar and some shiny pebbles. Because of its sentimental value, the littlest angel's box of trash is chosen over the more elaborate and costly gifts of the other angels.

Gold is mentioned several times but is usually brushed off as only useful for decorations. Once, the main character notices a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">State</a> ship-of-the-line and realizes its wooden hull is gold-plated. He muses that they could've afforded to iron-plate it, but it would just rust.

The local children <em>do</em> steal money when they raid abandoned supermarkets and buildings for food, but Lisa notes that money isn't any good anymore, since "there's nowhere to spend it".

He is still human enough to appreciate the irony. In <em>2061: Odyssey Three</em>, it turns out that the stellar ignition of Jupiter at the end of the previous book tossed a few "insignificant chunks" of this core up into orbit, including one mountain-sized hunk that landed on one of the Jovian moons.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Biblical</a> example:
<div class="indent"><strong>1 Kings 10:21</strong> : All King Solomons goblets were gold, and all the household articles in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in Solomon's days.
</div><ul><li> This is either a case of silver being Worthless Yellow Rocks (or worthless white rocks, in this case), or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a> about the level of Solomon's wealth.

<ul><li> The Ireland Quiddich team mascots are leprechauns that make their entrance throwing gold coins on the audience. However, this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> when it becomes apparent that the leprechauns had thrown leprechaun gold, which vanishes after a few days. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This puts Ron in an angsty mood since he paid Harry back for buying him some binoculars with the gold instead of "real" money, and is too poor to actually pay him back.

</li><li> Also invoked with portkeys. Almost anything can be made into a portkey, so if someone is making a portkey to leave somewhere outdoors so that someone else can use it later, they often make it out of something seemingly worthless (like an old newspaper or an abandoned shoe or something) so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> who happen to come along in the mean time won't be tempted to touch it.
</li><li> In a similar vein, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Horcruxes</a> can be made out of anything. In fact, the very first Horcrux Harry ever found was a blank diary. Harry mentions that this would make finding all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Voldemort's</a> Horcruxes a difficult task. Dumbledore however, points out that Voldemort's fatal flaw is vanity and he would never store parts of his soul in anything he doesn't deem "worthy" of him (the diary being just his first attempt at creating one).

Even air and soil had to be shipped in at hideous expense, and though the inhabitants, transported there very much against their will, live in tunnels drilled through solid gold, they're still the poorest people in the galaxy. By the opening of the second book, their economy has improved to the point that they can afford luxuries like clothing, and actual homes.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DocSavage">Doc Savage</a> novel <em>Murder Melody</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth">Beneath the Earth</a> kingdom of Subterranea uses gold for a huge variety of uses as it is the most abdundant and ductile metal available.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">The End Of The Matter</a></em>, the incomprehensible alien Abalamahalamatandra sits around idly, playing with its toes and setting stones into circles, while the other characters talk. Naturally, nobody notices that it's using very large gemstones to do so, or that it stumbles in a hole where the priceless archeological treasures two of the speakers had been seeking for months are concealed.

Most notably, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfAlice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfAlice">The Voyage of Alice</a></em> features Alice looking for a replacement for a 1.5 kg gold nugget she took from the school's museum and lost.

Dragons in that verse transform dirt and rock into gold over long exposure to their bodies, so caves where they sleep gradually acquire golden linings. They don't find it <em>entirely</em> useless; it's comfortable to sleep on, decorative, they can soften it with their fiery breaths and carve and sculpt it, and most importantly they're able to slather it on as bandages after they're injured, to seal the wounds. They're still baffled by the human desire for it.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersTransTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersTransTech">Transformers: TransTech</a></em> short story "Gone Too Far", the heroes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue">for a certain technical value of "hero"</a>) at one point end up on an alien planet where the natives are having a problem with millions of tons of Worthless Pink Rocks: "squareish ones that glow and explode if you hit them too hard or bring fire near them".

</li><li> Played straight, ignored <em>and</em> averted in Hugo Silva's novel <em>Pacha Pulai</em>: a Chilean military pilot (none other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lieutenant Alejandro Bello</span>) in the early XX century gets lost during a test flight and ends up somewhere in the Andes Mountains. He finds the City of the Caesars, known locally as Pacha Pulai, cut off from communication for at least two centuries and still loyal to Spain. After some adventures <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the destruction of the city</span>, he returns to civilization, although he never returns to Chile.
<ul><li> In the city, gold and silver are abundant to the point of being worthless, while copper is rare and expensive. The church bells are made of gold, as are many other things, including regular cutlery (<em>fine</em> cutlery is made of copper).
</li><li> As mentioned above, silver is as abundant as gold, but there aren't any references about it being commonly used.
</li><li> Early in the story, the pilot confiscates a suitcase with 50.000 Chilean pesos (about 230000 US dollars in today's money) from a thief. This money is stored away and unmentioned during his time in Pacha Pulai. After leaving the city, he loses the suitcase, but chooses not to retrieve it as it was "ill-gotten money" (and he had the key to a treasury, where he'd later recover many riches in the form of gemstones).
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Litrature/ThomasCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Litrature/ThomasCovenant">Thomas Covenant</a></em> books, where gold is priceless, partly because of rarity, and partly because it makes the local magic stronger. White gold, an alloy, is even more valuable, being the key to wild magic.
</li><li> Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLongEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLongEarth">The Long Earth</a></em> takes place in a near future where simple devices allow (nearly) anyone to "step" sideways onto Earth in parallel universes. A minor character decides to step a few worlds over from Sutter's Mill with the intent of finding a jackpot of untouched gold - and finds out that: 1) he's not the only one who had the idea, and 2) it's pointless because there's literally an infinity of Earths out there making every material abundant if you can get to it. However, iron (aside from the iron in blood) can't be carried while stepping, meaning every colony is starting from Bronze Age technology and real value is no longer in resources but expertise - <em>every</em> colony wants someone who knows how to work metal and eventually let them develop iron production. Many others realize infinite abundance means billions of humans could simply forage for what they need, dissolving the need for high-density agriculture and stable settlements entirely.
</li><li> Played with in Elizabeth Enright's <em>Tatsinda</em>. There's a metal — pretty, but devoid of any practical use — that's so common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia">Tatrajan</a> that the ore is used to pave streets... which happens to be the <em>same</em> metal coveted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOgresAreHungrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOgresAreHungrier">a greedy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">brutal ogre</a>.

The Lord Ruler's entire economy is based on atium, with the coins backed by it and the nobles taxed in it. Furthermore, the only way to hire a kandra is with atium. A key plot point of the first book is seizing the Lord Ruler's atium treasury to bribe the armies, and a major plot point of the second book is that they <em>can't find it</em>. It's estimated that ninety percent of all the atium ever mined was in the Lord Ruler's hands, but there are no clues as to where it might be. In the third book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they discover that it was actually in the hands of the kandra. Atium is the body of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> Ruin, so the Lord Ruler focused on keeping it away from him despite needing it for his own purposes. Elend and his atium mistings burn it away fighting Ruin's armies, which puts it out of his grasp for long enough that Vin is able to Ascend as Ruin's opposite and kill him</span>.
<ul><li> As Yomen points out, Atium is worthless in his city because of the Empire's collapse. Only rare Mistborn (who can use any metal) can use it, so a city without Mistborn or access to trade with other Mistborn is sitting on a pile of worthless shiny beads. Even after it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Atium mistings (who can use just one metal) exist, they're difficult to find because TLR suppressed knowledge of their existence; anyone not in the Steel Ministry thinks it's a waste of time and money to test for it</span>.

<ul><li> An interesting example. Stone is sacred to the Shin ethnicity, meaning that extracting metal by mining or smelting is forbidden. However, the Vorin ardents have access to Soulcasting, the power to turn one substance into another, and often practice by turning random trash into metal. At least one Vorin merchant makes a fortune by trading this trash-metal for exotic Shin fruits, vegetables, and livestock.
</li><li> The currency of choice is spheres, gemstones (filled with the titular stormlight) suspended in glass. Since the type of gem determines what a Soulcaster can use it for, emeralds (which can make food) are the most valuable, while diamonds (which can make glass) are the least.
</li><li> Due to the aforementioned Soulcasting, most valuable materials are significantly cheaper than they would otherwise be. Gold and silver are rarely mentioned, and when they are it is just as minor decorations. Aluminium (infamously valuable in most societies before they discover how to refine it) does not exist naturally on the planet, so you'd think it would be even more valuable than it was in real life. But since Soulcasters can make it at a whim, it is little more than a somewhat rare curiosity. Gems are one of the few things Soulcasters <em>can't</em> produce, which is yet another reason they're so valuable.

On their colony, however, which is deliberately dependent on Earth for survival, gold isn't any more valuable than for its physical properties.

He also off-handedly mentions that he has since "returned" the gold, or, rather, a replicated nugget that any star-faring race can easily make.

When, after many adventures, Li Po finally finds them, he finds that the Silkspinners' <em>only</em> resource is silk, and they have grown to hate it and long for other treasures.

However, due to a lack of packing paper underground, the medieval-era society instead packs the box with the only apparently useless paper in ample supply: surface-money, taken from the wallets left behind by other surface humans who had died underground.
</li><li> Lawrence David Kusche's <em>The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - SOLVED</em>:
<div class="indent">Several novelists have created civilizations in the center of the [Sargasso] Sea. Here, according to the stories, countless wrecks, many of them hundreds of years old and full of treasure, pile up against each other. The residents of the floating kingdom, who all drifted in helplessly at one time or other, disdain the treasure since it is no use to them.

Red crystals are roughly equivalent to the currency surfacer countries use, but orange crystals are worth a thousand times more, yellow a thousand times more than that, so on and so on. When Alex first becomes blue he tries to send a blue crystal to his family, and is informed that this one crystal could kill the economy of his entire home country. He sends yellows instead, a million times less than what he wanted, and when he returns home he finds that his family is now the richest in the city by a very large margin.
</li><li> <em>Men of Honor</em> by Will Garth. Earthmen land on an alien planet and find a city of gold. Thinking the aliens will defend this valuable commodity, they sneak in at night and steal all that they can carry. But on returning to their rocketship they find the aliens have cut it up for the steel, which is rare on their world. Being honorable beings however, the aliens leave a huge mountain of gold in compensation next to the now-useless rocket.
</li><li> In <em>The Crystal Palace</em> by Phyllis Eisenstein, a bit of magical travel gone awry sends the wizard Cray Ormoru to a land where gemstones are so common that they're no more valuable than any other pretty rock. On the other hand, silver is so rare that a woman he makes a purchase from hardly knows what to do with the coin he uses to make the purchase, ultimately choosing to make it into a piece of jewelry.

Ordinary latinum cannot be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator">replicated</a>, and because it's liquid at room temperature (like mercury) and even a small drop represents a considerable sum, it's encased in gold to make convenient (and shiny) units of currency.

His bitterness ends quickly, though, when Morn walks into his bar and spits up a shot-glass full of latinum to give to him, which represents a small fortune.
<ul><li> In the episode, Quark falls victim to a con game and ends up owning a large amount of valueless, hollowed-out bars of 24k gold. Of course, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">crafty and greedy sonuvabitch</a> that he is, the Ferengi promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverts</a> this by remembering that <em>other</em>, more primitive races in the galaxy would consider the gold valuable, and tries to convince the guy who got him caught up in the scheme in the first place to help him barter with them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> isn't completely consistent with this though; there have been episodes in <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and <em>Enterprise</em> where gold is of considerable worth to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Ferengi</a>. Partly this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a> as "gold-pressed latinum" as a <em>concept</em> didn't exist yet; but partly because gold <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalCurrency">does have a fair few uses</a> other than being shiny. At the very least it's more useful than the paper and cloth that modern banknotes are made from, anyway.
<ul><li> When Quark, Rom, and Nog wind up in the 20th Century in "Little Green Men," Quark considers gold a perfectly good commodity for which to trade with the humans.

George is surprised that he offered him gold as if it were really worth something since a way to manufacture it was developed decades earlier.

He is captured by bandits who get drunk on the wine stored there. They open the bags of gold dust, not realising what it is, and allow it to spill onto the beach and be washed away by the tide.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> campaign setting, the value of gold dropped sharply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">after the Cataclysm</a>; steel pieces are used where gold pieces would be used in other campaign settings. This made <em>very little sense.</em> Only a creative GM would stop you from getting rich by buying swords and melting them down. (Long Sword cost: 15 steel pieces. Weight: ~4 lbs. Coin weight: 1/10 lb.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em>, you can't melt down your swords for (insanely valuable) steel, because of course <em>only the god-kings</em> (and their trusted lieutenants and so on) can afford a steel sword; most weapons are made of obsidian. The primary currency is ceramic, and is backed by the God-Kings' say-so, not by any inherent value of its material (although more valuable silver, gold, and platinum pieces do exist, they are so valuable that they are almost never used; and nobody would waste what little steel there is on currency, since it is essentially priceless).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Midnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Midnight">Midnight</a></em> setting, gold and gems became useless trinkets after the Dark Lord Izrador conquered the world. Surviving humans and humanoids have reverted to a barter system. The only people who use coins as currency at all are the "Traitor Princes", those who surrendered without a fight; they will commonly give peasants a worthless gold coin when they commandeer goods and services, under the pretense they're "buying" them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Lizardmen</a> don't understand why humans (and elves and dwarves) are so greedy for gold and jewels. They value gold, not for its beauty or rarity but for its long-lasting nature — gold is almost completely rust-proof and good to store information on. The ancient tablets of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Old Ones</a> are all written on gold, which they will do anything to recover. They <em>make their armor</em> out of the stuff, or at least the Temple Guard and high-ranking Saurus do. And they don't even give a damn about most of what the other races steal from them; the only stuff they really put any effort into retrieving are their sacred plaques and the relics of the Old Ones. As it was best put by a Skink Priest:
<div class="indent">"Why do they always want gold? What do they do with it? Do they <em>eat</em> it?"
</div></li><li> Ogres consider gold innately worthless because it doesn't make good eating and isn't sturdy enough to make weapons or useful tools out of. Between a pile of iron and a pile of gold, they'd take the iron and then use it to club the guy that took the gold and rob him. They do hoard it... but only because they can "con" other races into giving them "valuable" food and weapons in exchange for "worthless" gold. Greasus Goldtooth (an ogre smart enough to tax the Silk Road and thus is the richest person in Warhammer), however, seems to have found another use; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">paying people on the other side to suffer a spontaneous outbreak of incompetence</a>.
</li><li> Skaven, similarly, have an economy based almost entirely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">warpstone</a>, food and slaves. Skaven only value gold in that it can be used to bribe man-things.
</li><li> The Tomb Kings, similar to the Lizardmen, value gold because most of the surviving artefacts of their realms and dynasties are made of it. Tomb Kings will launch full-scale invasions on anyone who so much as takes a single gold coin from them, but it's because they dared <em>stealing from them</em>: The theft is more important to them than whatever was actually stolen.
<ul><li> One instance has a dwarf hammer that has a Nekaharan coin on it and has been the cause of multiple wars for more than two thousand years. The dwarfs want the hammer because it was made by a dwarf, the Tomb King wants the coin because it's his. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatingTheSimpleSolution">The person who suggests removing the (strictly decorative) coin and returning it to the king</a> is looked at like he's an idiot.

Magi tend to use an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyEconomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyEconomy">Energy Economy</a> of Vis, condensed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a> that's tremendously useful for magic and that has to be harvested rather than magically produced.

Returned (basically zombies with no memories) fashion masks out of gold; returned merchants don't accept gold currency, favoring coins made from the clay funeral masks. The underworld god, Erebos, is the god of greed and wealth as well as the dead.
</li><li> A certain island in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> had silkworms aplenty, but no sources of cotton or leather. The island had been cut off from the rest of Creation for a while; when traders finally recontacted them, the residents eagerly traded fine silk clothes - which become uncomfortable when doing a day's labor in the field in them - for more practical cotton.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera">Numenera</a></em> is set in the "Ninth World," Earth a billion years in the future in the ruins of eight great, impossibly advanced civilizations that then disappeared. The Earth has been so completely processed and rebuilt (perhaps literally) that there's not even meaningfully "natural" soil anymore. The ancients either transmuted or imported so many previously-rare materials from other worlds that the concept of intrinsic value doesn't exist. If a currency is in gold, then it's because the minting authority decided it was the most economical material to use at the time.

One adventure in Itznotyerzitz Mine in which you "feel pretty moxious for trading a bunch of worthless rocks for cold, hard meat", those rocks being various diamonds.

</li><li> In the same mine, it's possible to convert your "worthless" chunks of diamond into useful chunks of coal. Yay!

</li></ul></li><li> In the freeware game <em>Vinnie's Tomb</em>, you encounter an Old Queer Snake living on a heap of garbage who has the key to the aforementioned tomb. Understandably, the player will try offering him various items in their inventory, including an enormous diamond you find in that same heap. Waving the diamond in front of him will prompt dialogue along these lines:
<div class="indent"><strong>Vinnie:</strong> Will you trade me the key for this diamond? <br/><strong>Snake:</strong> What are you, stupid? Diamonds are worthless! Why do you think it's in the trash?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeVelocity">Escape Velocity</a>: Nova</em>, railgun rails and ammunition must be made of, naturally, a material with high conductivity - "something cheap, like copper or gold". One can only theorize that, somewhere in the game's universe, there exists a planet(s) with obscene amounts of the stuff. Metal even seems to have more worth, being a tradable commodity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inverted with a silly quote for female Draenei, a member of a race of interdimensional refugees: "This planet has a tremendous supply of sandstone. The inhabitants must be wealthy beyond their dreams!"
</li><li> Another example appears in several instances. One example would be Uldaman. At the end of the instance, the group would find a chest of one or two gear pieces that they take. However, your avatar seems to ignore the fact that there's large piles of gold right next to the chest. Perhaps the ultimate example is Utgarde Pinnacle, where the <em>very first room</em> is the <em>treasury</em>. Players have found a use for it though. If you take a detour across the piles of gold you can skip the first encounter! That said, there's a good reason for this — the gold is cursed. The skeletons tending to it are the former companions of the drunken dwarf hanging out by the entrance. So taking any of that stuff is a bad, bad idea.
</li><li> This even applies to the main unit of currency in <em>World of Warcraft</em>, gold coins. As the game has aged and subsequent expansions have inflated the amount of gold in the game economy, they have become more and more plentiful, and consequently less and less valuable.
</li><li> It's played completely straight with the gold you mine, which cannot be converted into coins except by selling it (apparently nobody thought a mint was a good idea) and has relatively few uses in crafting items, most of which aren't all that good even for appropriate-level characters.
</li><li> The people from Sporeggar do consider the use of coins weird. If you want to buy anything from them you have to do so in shiny mushrooms called Glowcaps.
</li></ul></li><li> Late in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopfulMail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopfulMail">Popful Mail</a></em>, air-headed elf boy Slick is astonished when Mail mentions to him that she needs to find a set of magical orbs to prevent the Overlord from reviving. They're actually powerful artifacts, but Slick thinks of treasure in terms of gold coins and precious jewels and tells her that he wouldn't bother to pick them up if he saw them.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> Universe, bottle caps are generally used for currency. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, the player can find stacks of pre-War Money, and while they're not totally worthless, they're considered no different than any other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a> item.
<ul><li> This is obviously a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> (which switched from the caps of the first game to generic "money"), where you stumble on an enormous heap of bottle caps, which are now worthless.
</li><li> Incidentally, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> the value of the bottlecaps received a good explanation: they were backed up by the <em>real</em> currency, like banknotes used to be backed up by gold in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>: clean water, the most valuable substance in the wasteland. They were also incapable of being replicated, thus no forgery and their mineral composition gave them a modicum of worth. Same case with bottle caps in the Capital Wasteland.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> a couple more wrinkles are added. Everyone in the game still prefers to deal with caps instead of other currency - only casino cashiers are willing to pay you in NCR dollars or Legion coins. That said, every currency can be traded for caps or vice versa at their respective exchange rate from anyone willing to barter with you, regardless of your barter skill. The NCR starts to print paper money backed by gold. Unfortunately, before the game starts the NCR gold reserves are irradiated by the Brotherhood of Steel, so they have to switch back to backing their currency on water. This massively reduces the value of the NCR dollar. The Legion mints its own money system of gold and silver coins which end up having a higher value than NCR currency or bottle caps, owing to actually being made from the metals. Alice McLafferty of the Crimson Caravan company gives you a quest to destroy a bottle cap press located in a pre-War soda factory, noting that a supply of newly pressed "counterfeit" caps will destabilize the economy. (Unfortunately, you aren't given a chance to use the press before destroying it.) In the <em>Dead Money</em> expansion, you can come across gold ingots - these weigh 35 pounds and are valued at 10,349 caps. This means that many items (like fully-repaired rifles and energy weapons) are worth <em>more</em> than their weight in gold.
</li><li> Thanks to the new equipment modding and settlement construction systems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em>, all the junk that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a> in <em>Fallout 3</em> and New Vegas has now become extremely useful material. However, your companions will still grumble about your insistence on picking up every "worthless" item you find, even after they've seen you using it to make high-tech weapons or turn a small shack into a heavily armed fortress. The sole exception to this is Piper, who instead complements you for your ability to figure out a use for all of it.
<ul><li> The Junk Jet gun (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">which fires junk</a>) adds another wrinkle to the value of Pre-War Money. As in previous games, pre-war money is mostly Vendor Trash, though it can also be scrapped for a small amount of cloth. But the Junk Jet does the same damage with any item, regardless of what it is, allowing the player to make use of junk they don't want. The downside is that junk has mass, and the player can only carry so much, whereas most forms of ammunition (even bulky things like rockets) weigh nothing. Pre-War Money, however, also weighs nothing. This means you can carry as much as you want, and one of the most practical uses for it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney">is as ammunition</a>.
</li><li> Since Pre-War Money can be scrapped into cloth, and cloth is required to make most furniture (especially beds), you can literally create a bed made out of money. Pre-War money is something of a subversion, though; despite the economy it traded on no longer existing, the stuff is valuable enough to warrant an exchange rate of 1 to 8 with the currency that <em>is</em> in common use.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The MMORPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Runescape">Runescape</a></em> sometimes did this, along with other self-parody. In one quest, there is a cutscene of the Trolls killing an adventurer and discarding the 'worthless' red metal he was wearing (the most expensive set of armor in the game at the time).
<ul><li> The Villagers in Tai Bwo Wannai on Karamja consider gold to be not worth much, due to how much of it there is on Karamja, but find some plants to be useful as currency. The TzHaar also find gold useless, because the volcano they live in is hot enough that it melts (curiously, the temperature seems only to make gold worthless in TzHaar city, burn paper, and make Rum vanish, and not affect anything else), so they use bits of obsidian as currency.
</li><li> Played much more literally in the in-game world economy — gold and silver are only used in the Crafting skill, and as such, gold and silver ores and bars are worth far less than mere <em>iron ore</em>. Items made out of gold or silver, if they don't include gems, are generally worth even <em>less</em> than the ores and bars, if only because no more experience can come out of processing them.
</li><li> Similarly, most of the tradable gemstones in the game are nearly worthless because of how common they are. They are cheap enough that they are used for making tips for enchanted crossbow bolts. Only the very rare high level gems, such as the Onyx, which is not a particiarly valueable gem in real life, are worth anything significant.

</li></ul></li><li> Although gold is still very rare in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, there's no monetary system. As a result, it can only be used in crafting, and, to the dismay of many, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">a sword made of gold is as useful as one made of wood</a>. Gold tools mine faster than diamond, but a Gold Pickaxe still counts as though it were Wood for purposes of what it can harvest. Gold can also be used to craft a handy watch, and more importantly its conductivity makes it an essential ingredient in Booster Rails, which can speed up or slow down mine carts.
<ul><li> At the same time, the trope is averted, however; diamonds are the rarest item in the game, and can be crafted into the strongest armor and tools available. And a record player.
</li><li> As of recent updates, there <em>is</em> a currency system, but it runs on emeralds, not gold. Emeralds are still very rare and hard to obtain through mining, although easy to trade with Villagers. Gold can only be traded for emeralds with a few Villagers, and the exchange is pretty poor considering gold's rarity (especially when you can trade wheat or gravel for the same amount).
</li><li> This finally gets averted for gold in the 1.16 update, which introduces bartering with the Nether-exclusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PigMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PigMan">piglin</a> mob. Throwing gold ingots at one distracts them from attacking the player and prompts them to toss a random item to the player. In addition, full gold armor will prevent piglins from becoming hostile.

In one instance, rebels are smelting ammo using salvaged silver jewelry. Another shows a doll clearly made after the disaster, as it has diamond earrings for eyes and ripped silk for a dress.
</li><li> While gold or platinum, depending on the world, is still somewhat valuable in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em>, by the time you have the means to mine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">Adamantine</a>, you'll have more than you know what to do with.

You can also use it to make gold blocks, gold platforms, and treasure piles, in case you want to live in opulence.
</li><li> A very interesting case showed up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerGeneratedEconomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerGeneratedEconomy">player market</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>. Due to the in-game currency of gold being ridiculously easy to obtain, it didn't take long for any item worth buying from another player to quickly become worth more gold than it was physically possible to carry. Players started using a rare drop as a <em>de facto</em> currency instead.
<ul><li> This goes back to the days of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a> I</em>, where particularly rare items were used as currency. Because gold could only be handled in stacks of up to 5,000, unique rings, elixirs and the like became a far more fungible currency for items priced at hundreds of thousands. (Of course, since the game was commonly hacked to death and back, there was very little real 'economy'.)
</li><li> What makes this even more interesting is that the rare drop item used as currency (The Stone of Jordan, or SoJ) was originally a very highly sought after ring, so much so that it was duped/hacked to hell and back, leading to a massive supply. When the item was later nerfed to counter all the hacking, it lost its intrinsic value and thus the market was full of these essentially worthless, but still hard to come by (legitimately) items. Hence their adoption as currency.

<ul><li> <span>TG: alright well its not like i even have a problem parting with this useless bullshit money</span>
</li><li> This may not be entirely true — both Aradia and Terezi state, and John later confirms, that the Boonbucks are used to purchase 'fraymotifs' which are likely styles of combat. The trolls have apparently all bought the best ones they could, and Dave apparently bought a few offscreen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's just that Dave used his time-travel abilities to manipulate the game economy</span>.
</li><li> Jane has an item that converts whatever she wants into grist, at the price of a few boonbucks. However, since she has no idea what grist is supposed to be used for, she considers the item completely useless. Similarly, she already has a fortune in boondollars and a fetch modus which lists the alchemy components of items, but she has no idea that they'll have something of a use in the near future.

Gems at first <em>look</em> like this, but only because one of the main characters has the power of finding them in abundance and another, a dragon, eats them. In another episode, their value fluctuates wildly, a single jewel can be used for buying things ranging from four round trip train tickets plus pet fees to an industrial-sized hair dryer, (and the tiniest one buys the most expensive item, and vice versa). Although they were mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">being used as bribes</a> in that episode, so it wasn't like the characters were getting them appraised first. Rarity later gives small ones out like tips, and most ponies react like she handed them a hundred dollar bill. So it seems <em>some</em> of them are rare and worth a lot, while others, may be so plentiful there <em>is</em> no good use for them other than cake garnish and door stops. In "Rock Solid Friendship", Maud Pie is unimpressed by a large pile of jewels and comments that they are practically worthless because they are so common.

<ul><li> Aluminium:
<ul><li> Between the late 1820s, when Hans Christian Ørsted first extracted it in pure form, and the invention of the Bayer and HallHéroult processes in the late 1880s, pure refined aluminium was more expensive than gold. Merely heating the ore will only give you an impure mixture of several minerals (mostly aluminum oxides and silicates) unlike most other metals, and early methods of extraction required reacting difficult-to-produce anhydrous aluminium salts (typically aluminium chloride) with alkali metals (typically sodium or potassium) until the modern Hall-Héroult process was discovered.
</li><li> Napoleon III reserved aluminium cutlery for the most important of guests. Less favored guests had to settle for gold.
</li><li> In 1884, the United States capped the Washington monument with a 100-ounce pyramid of aluminium to show off its industry.
</li><li> Aluminium remained quite valuable in areas where electricity was not cheaply available well into 20th century. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, Aluminium was plentiful only in the US, thanks to TVA and other large scale hydroelectric projects.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note43x3i');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note43x3i" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note43x3i');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Soviets also produced a large amount, but their production was all concentrated in a single hydroelectric facility which was lost within two months of the German invasion.</span> Elsewhere, planes were built out of wood or steel to conserve aluminium and enemy drop tanks were eagerly salvaged. (US Army Air Force countered by making drop tanks out of resin-impregnated paper to deny Germans the extra source of aluminium.)
</li></ul></li><li> Diamonds:
<ul><li> Given that diamonds are made entirely out of carbon, it really wouldn't be that hard for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> to make synthetic diamonds that are more perfect than the real thing. <em>Humans</em> have been making synthetic diamonds since the 1950s! Natural diamonds are made by geological pressure applied to carbon, and the synthetic process does this faster. The gemstone industry reacted by establishing the principle that natural diamonds are more valuable than synthetic diamonds because... well, just because. But even without synthetic production, diamonds are actually quite common. Their prices are kept artificially inflated via a near-monopoly on worldwide distribution and a decades-long advertising campaign that's inextricably linked diamond rings to marriage in the public consciousness.
</li><li> In 2010, astronomers discovered an exoplanet called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55_Cancri_e">55 Cancri e<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a hellish world twice the size of Earth, blisteringly hot as a result of its proximity to its parent star, which appeared to be made <em>entirely</em> of diamond. While more recent studies have downplayed this — instead, 55 Cancri e may not just have large amounts of diamonds, but other useful carbon materials such as hydrocarbons on its surface — it still suggests both that the planet has huge, economy-collapsing quantities of diamond, and that other diamond <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_planet">planets<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> probably exist elsewhere in the galaxy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50fxr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note50fxr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50fxr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And more that will exist in the future (in astronomical terms), as carbon is mass-produced in evolved stars</span>. It's believed <a class="urllink" href="https://www.space.com/26335-coldest-white-dwarf-star-diamond.html">white dwarf stars have cores composed of diamond<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Even in the Solar System, diamonds are far from rare; while there's no means of getting to them with our technology at this current time, it is thought that it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfSomethingUnusual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RainOfSomethingUnusual">rains</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24477667">diamonds on Jupiter and Saturn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the largest and second largest of our neighbouring planets. Lightning strikes create clumps of soot by burning methane in the dense atmosphere, which then falls out of the sky; as this soot falls deeper and deeper into the planet's interior, extreme pressure and heat transforms the soot into very small diamonds!
</li><li> Diamonds also have <em>practical</em> uses. Being extremely hard, diamonds are used as drill bits and saw tips, as well as abrasives for industrial purposes, as well as scalpels. All of which are surprisingly cheap compared to the fancy jewelry, as the two purposes prize different attributes, and just about no one cares if their industrial diamonds are synthetic or not. Jeweler attempts to market industrial-grade diamonds as "chocolate diamonds" have so far met limited success.
</li></ul></li><li> Platinum:
<ul><li> For starters, the name is derived from Spanish for "false silver" — the same way iron pyrite is called "fool's gold". That gives you an idea what the Spanish thought of it at the time.
</li><li> The Spanish Conquistador myth of <em>Cibola</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityOfGold">City of Gold</a>, was partly based on a tribe in the Amazon where a certain metal was so common that it was used for body paint and inexpensive decorations. Unfortunately, when the Spaniards finally found the tribe they were distressed to learn that the metal in question was platinum, which the natives had fashioned into elaborate jewelry. Frustrated Spaniards worked the Indians to death in the mines looking for gold, only to turn up mounds upon mounds of previously unheard-of platinum. Not knowing how to work the ore, since they had worked the tribe to death in the mines (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">and later engineers never did figure out how they did it</a>), and given that it was so rare back home that it had no resale value, the angry Spaniards called the whole expedition worthless and buried the mounds of platinum ore in slag heaps that later became "lost treasure" more valuable than a city of gold by the 20<sup>th</sup> century, quite literally considering the stuff rubbish.
</li><li> Back in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, some men counterfeited gold coins by using a "worthless" gray metal and gold plating the coins. Today, that "worthless gray metal" is known as <em>platinum</em>, and it's actually <em>more valuable than gold</em> for its applications. And is estimated to be 10 times rarer than gold.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6r6k7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6r6k7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6r6k7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Despite this, demand for ornamental gold and its traditional association with wealth leads to their prices per ounce being pretty similar. Whenever gold is more expensive than platinum that's a clue that the gold market is in the midst of a bubble, and thus it's probably a good time to sell rather than buy gold.</span> If you have a car, your catalytic converter has a considerable amount of the stuff. This has led some enterprising thieves to harvest whole parking lots with metal-cutting saber saws, cutting out the converters for recycle value.
</li><li> In the 17<sup>th</sup> century, the Spanish government tried to stop the above counterfeiting practice by <em>dumping their entire stock of platinum in the sea</em>.
</li><li> When platinum was first found in Russia, the ignorant population used it as shot — you had to pay for lead. Then they found out that shooting an animal was more expensive than the animal. It's worth mentioning that they thought they were firing low purity silver ore, which looks similar. Smelting and shipping operations in Siberia were so expensive the low purity ore of anything just wasn't worth anything.
</li></ul></li><li> A British man found some old Beatles memorabilia in his attic and sold it for a few quid at a flea market. Turns out it was <em>extremely rare</em> memorabilia that was actually worth thousands of dollars... or maybe not. Urban legends about Worthless Yellow Rocks are, naturally, extremely common.
</li><li> The gold miners of Yogo Gulch, Montana had spent decades panning for trace amounts of gold for slim profits while routinely discarding bucket-fulls of the "blue pebbles" that littered the area. While stories vary on exactly who it was, somebody eventually got curious about what exactly these funny rocks were, and had an expert look at them. Today, the legendary <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogo_sapphire">Yogo Sapphire Deposit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is known for having yielded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of the finest sapphires ever mined, with large portions of the lode remaining to be extracted.
</li><li> Gold was very abundant in pre-colonial Philippines. As in, you could see gold everywhere; decorated on houses, jewelry, etc. But finding gold was just as common as, let's say, getting a piece of candy. Pick almost any spot, dig, and you'll find a nugget of gold. And when Portuguese traders came, natives were willing enough to trade two gold pesos' worth... for a measly silver one.
</li><li> An interesting variation occurred with the U.S. gold rush into the Black Hills of South Dakota. Miners were pissed that their sifting machines kept getting clogged with a thick blue powder. An enterprising businessman found a way to filter it out and kept the powder as part of the payment. It turned out that the blue powder was silver in concentrations of nearly 100 times higher than the gold. While gold is significantly more valuable than silver, it's not 100 times more valuable. <br/><br/>Gold prospectors in Virginia Range in Nevada were frustrated by the same stuff, in the form of irritating mud that made mining very messy and unpleasant business, and much of it ended up being discarded to be washed away by the streams of Mt. Davidson. It took quite a while before anyone realized that this fractious blue mud was indicative of <em>MASSIVE</em> quantities of silver ore. The site came to be known as the Comstock Lode and is still being mined today, over 150 years after its discovery.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">vein</a> of the metal examples above, a surprising number of scrappers will toss off unstripped refrigerators, washers, etc. into the tin pile<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7xd28');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7xd28" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7xd28');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">essentially the mulligan pile</span> so they can go out and get more to do the same thing; most of these are druggies just out for their next fix who can't be bothered to take the time to actually process the things.
</li><li> Medieval Egypt provides a near-literal example. In 1324, Mansa Musa (literally, Emperor Moses) of Mali, a devout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Muslim</a>, went on pilgrimage to Mecca, passing through Cairo on the way. Now, Mali is gold country, and at the time supplied the Mediterranean with a very large proportion of its gold. West African kings since the Ghana Empire had a tradition of taking a cut of every golden ounce, so the Mansa of Mali tended to be <em>extremely</em> rich. Thus, when Mansa Musa went on pilgrimage, besides all manner of little gold items carried by the people in his entourage, he also had with him about 80 camels laden with 300 pounds of gold. Each. When Mansa Musa reached Cairo, he went for a visit to the Sultan, and then down to the <em>souk</em> (bazaar) to buy souvenirs and such. Unfortunately for the Malians, <em>nobody</em> in the entourage had any idea what things were supposed to cost in Cairo, and naturally the Cairo merchants fleeced the Malians for every penny they could get. Plus, there was the fact that one of Islam's basic principles is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat">charity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, with the Malians just as ignorant about the proper amounts. This pumped enough gold into the Egyptian economy to cause <em>massive</em> inflation, drastically devaluing all gold in Egypt. For the next ten years, gold, while hardly worthless, commanded <em>ridiculously</em> reduced purchasing power. On the other hand, the Italians doing business in Egypt at the time loved these new prices, since Italy hadn't suffered the same inflation (although everyone in the Mediterranean was affected somewhat).
<ul><li> Egypt itself was something of an example <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">in ancient times</a>, as it had access to then-abundant gold deposits in Nubia. <em>Silver</em>, on the other hand, had to be imported from the Fertile Crescent, and jewelry or other items crafted from silver often fetched higher prices in Egyptian markets than equivalent gold wares.
</li></ul></li><li> Manure (which is to say, feces-laden soil) has been handy for agriculture for centuries, but it got especially valuable after the 16<sup>th</sup>-century battlefields' warriors tended to have guns in their hands and manure could be used produce gunpowder. Various states in Europe even levied a tax of manure on farms around this time.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_starter_kits">Euro starter kits<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were sets of a few coins totaling around from about 4 to 20 Euros given out before the actual introduction of Euro cash. Many of these were simply the first Euros people spent — and these people are now probably kicking themselves as complete, unopened kits can nowadays be worth ten times their original value as collector items. The record is held by Finnish kits, which are worth forty times the nominal value of their coins.
</li><li> Not necessarily worthless, but rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">worth less</a>: the gold-to-silver ratio was far lower in Tokugawa Japan than in the Western world at the time, and, as a result, Western traders brought large amounts of silver to Japan and traded it for large amounts gold, nearly ruining the Japanese gold standard.
</li><li> The exact details are a bit memory fuzzed, but a Modern Marvels about chocolate gives us this: Chocolate was once extremely expensive, and extremely secret; the Spanish kept its existence a secret from the rest of Europe for decades. This came to its logical conclusion when some pirates, having captured a Spanish merchant ship and finding it was full of "dried sheep droppings" burned it and its cargo at a time when cocoa beans were worth their weight in silver.
</li><li> Even perfectly ordinary rocks can fall under this trope if there's a sudden demand for them. White Jurassic limestone from Solnhofen, in Bavaria, was just a relatively mundane construction material for roofs and floors (it was used for some fine carving, but only locally) until 1796, when lithographic printing was invented and created an insatiable market for the stuff. When printing tech marched on, Solnhofen's limestone became more or less just another rock again (paleontologists know it for its good supply of Late Jurassic fossils, the most famous of which is <em>Archaeopteryx lithographica</em> — the fossil that provided the first strong evidence that birds are dinosaurs, named after the lithographic boom that led to its discovery).
</li><li> Gibbon tells the story of a Roman legionary who found a leather bag full of pearls that had been dropped by a fleeing Persian soldier. The Roman kept the bag and threw away its contents — he assumed that something with no use would have no value.
</li><li> There's an interesting case surrounding the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a></em> mystery stories. The books themselves have solid blue covers with the book's cover art being printed on a dust jacket. The books themselves now are fairly cheap (libraries refused to stock them, considering them "junk books," meaning more books were published for people to buy, saturating the market.) The dust jackets, however, which are considered a nuisance to some bibliophiles (for being clumsy and unattractive on the shelf), have become much more valuable. Not simply because fewer dust jackets have survived, but due to an unfortunate fire at the home of the artist, Russell H. Tandy, the original artwork has been lost. At this point, the dust jackets can be worth more than the book itself.
</li><li> Pablo Escobar once burned $2,000,000 cash to keep himself and his daughter warm while fleeing police in the mountains of Columbia. His daughter was starting to suffer from hypothermia and the cash was otherwise worthless.
</li><li> This worked <em>both</em> ways in the North American fur trade from roughly the 17<sup>th</sup> to the 19<sup>th</sup> centuries. To the Aboriginal peoples, the furs they were selling to the European fur traders were fairly common, easy to obtain and used for mundane purposes. In Europe, those same furs could be worth huge fortunes due to fashion-conscious European aristocrats hit with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ErmineCapeEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ErmineCapeEffect">Ermine Cape Effect</a>. The knives, cooking pots and other trade goods the Europeans were giving the Aboriginals in exchange were often fairly common, easy to obtain and mundane, but to the Aboriginal peoples they were often far more effective than the hand-crafted tools they'd frequently been using before. The natives at the time lived in a mostly stone-age (or in South America, bronze age) society; they didn't have access to the technology necessary to smelt iron and steel, and thus the only iron implements they could produce had to be cold-forged from rare meteoric iron.
</li><li> Supposedly Nigel Reynolds, who was the arts correspondent on the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, met <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> and she handed him a first edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></em> to read. He took it to his office, skimmed it, and threw it away. Copies of the first edition, of which only 500 were printed, are now worth thousands of dollars.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, silver half-dimes were being hoarded to the point that they could not be kept in circulation, and in response, the Union issued first paper five-cent notes, and finally a new five-cent coin made of an alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel. Fast forward to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, and suddenly nickel was a valuable material for manufacturing, so the government had to resort to replacing the nickel in newly minted five-cent coins with an alloy of Manganese and... you guessed it, <em>silver</em>! When World War II ended, the US Government hoped it could recover as many of these silver "War Nickels" as possible from circulation, but many stayed in circulation, and many more were hoarded as an investment, especially once the price of silver began to rise.
</li><li> Speaking of WWII: The one-cent Penny is struck from a zinc and copper alloy, both common metals, and considered worthless outside of pocket change, befitting its status as the lowest-value, lowest-denomination unit of the currency. But, in 1943, the demands on copper for use in component parts for the war effort made it so valuable as a strategic resource that the US Mint made all its pennies from plain <em>steel</em> that year. While steel was of course itself an important component of ships and tanks, the American steel industry at the time was more than capable of meeting that particular demand with plenty to spare.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8lbw7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8lbw7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8lbw7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The scrap metal drives to "support the war effort" were purely a morale-building exercise so that every civilian, even the elderly and children, could feel like they were doing their part to help. Not one ounce of donated bronze, iron or steel was actually used in the making of war material, and in fact little of it was even melted down at all until after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> was over.</span>
</li><li> After decimalisation in 1971, British small coins ("copper") carried on being manufactured in a bronze alloy, the advantage here being that smaller coins using a lot less metal and having a higher purchasing value cost less to manufacture. Scroll forward to the early 2000s and the value of the small coins inevitably diminishing. Those low-value small-denomination coins started disappearing from circulation in large numbers and nobody could work out why. Until it was realised that with the high cost of bronze, those small coins were now worth seven or eight times their face value as scrap metal and enterprising people were harvesting them to melt down. The redesigned small coins are now a thin bronze gilding over a steel core.
</li><li> The trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">zigzagged</a> regarding the myth of El Dorado. Spaniards heard of a tribe for whom gold was apparently so common it was all over the village and they dumped it in the lake for worship. The Spanish assumed it was because they had a massive gold reserve. Except, no. The village was wealthy and purchased gold and dumped it in the lake as a sacrificial offering to their Gods. Why was the village wealthy? It had a salt mine, which was <em>highly</em> desired by its neighbors. The tribe also didn't use gold currency, so while it was valuable, it was only used as decoration, meaning they saw no problems with displaying it everywhere. And the fact that it was valuable is exactly <em>why</em> it was considered worthy of being a sacrificial offering to the gods. If you give the gods something worthless, that's an insult rather than a sacrifice.
</li><li> According to some estimations, there's enough gold (and presumably other very valuable, high-density metals) in the Earth's core to cover the entire planet in several meters of it<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note97hu9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note97hu9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note97hu9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unless you love the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">hard way</a> or can wait five billion years to have the Sun consuming the Earth and picking the stuff, you'd better look elsewhere such as in certain asteroids</span>.
<ul><li> Asteroid 16 Psyche is believed to be laden with quite a significant amount of gold, silver and other valuable metals.
</li><li> There's also an estimated 20 million pounds of gold in the world's oceans, upward of half a trillion dollars at current value (not counting any gold inflation that would occur if 10,000 tons of the stuff suddenly entered the market). This doesn't refer to gold coins and bars from sunken treasure ships or to any veins of gold that might be beneath the seabed. This is gold that's <em>part of</em> the oceans, as in dissolved into the water. The problem is there's simply no way to get it. Gold is 13 parts per <strong>trillion</strong> in ocean water, and we can't filter out such tiny amounts.
</li></ul></li><li> The idea of "collector's editions" of comic books came from the fact that early issues of well-known titles, such as <em>Superman #1,</em> are worth a fortune now, so it follows that special editions of popular titles will eventually increase in value. However, the plan is a non-starter, as publishers release a "collector's edition", and collectors snap up as many copies as they can and work hard to keep them in mint condition, thus eliminating the rarity that made those early editions valuable. For example, comics published before or during World War II are valuable because paper was needed for the war effort, and many comic books were given up for this purpose. Not to mention they were mostly seen as cheap, disposable entertainment for kids and there was no active collector's market or comic book shops then, meaning the vast majority were damaged, destroyed, or lost over decades of play and exposure to the elements.
</li><li> When the Spaniards (starting to see a pattern here?) first landed in what would become modern Mexico, gold was the only metal any of the civilizations there knew how to work, and they used it mainly for decoration. Although it was not exactly "worthless" by their standards, specially to the dominant Aztecs, it seemed perfectly fair for them to trade it off to those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">nice strangers</a> for things they had never seen before. These things were, for the most part, glass beads and mirrors. It's also interesting to note that although gold was very valuable to the Aztecs, it was not nearly as valuable for them as it was for the Spaniards. So gold was everywhere, and it was often given as an offering. So when they offered great gifts of gold to those weird strangers that may or may not be ancient gods, well, the Spaniards just wondered where they had the rest of it, if they had so much they were willing to part with...
</li><li> The clacanth was occasionally fished up as bycatch by African trawlers. The fish had no commercial value because its flesh was foul-smelling, oily, and distasteful, but in 1938, one specimen was recognized by a museum curator for its unusual appearance; this here was a fish that was thought to have died out at the end of the Mesozoic Era, a living fossil representing an important transitional stage between finned fish and limbed tetrapods unchanged for almost 400 million years. But before its scientific value was found out, it was just thrown away because it couldn't be eaten.
</li><li> People have been dumb enough, or desperate enough to throw bullion-grade silver and (even rarer) gold coins into circulation, and there's nothing stopping them; an American Silver Eagle, while worth many times more in metal value, has a face value of a dollar; as a result, it's rare, but not unheard of to see people using them to pay for stuff worth far less than a handful of eagles, in some cases leaving some extremely lucky cashiers in their wake, as all they then have to do to retrieve the silver is replace the coins with ordinary currency that equals the same face value as the finds.
</li><li> Classic urban legend: A jilted wife advertises her ex-/absentee/cheating/imprisoned husband's car for way less than cheap in the newspaper. A youngish man comes to buy the car, typically a cherry 50s-70s pony car or custom muscle car with a Blue Book value that looks like a phone number, for $10. (In some versions, she just wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllJunk">get rid of the reminder</a>; in others, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">the husband had sent a message asking her to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">"sell the car and send me the money"</a>.) In such cases, variants include the wife selling the car for ridiculously small money, but refusing to sell it without something else, like a radio or spare tire, for which she charges closer to actual value of the car. While this has certainly been done in real life, it's worth noting that if there was a <em>court order</em> to the effect of "sell X and give the money to Y", pulling this trick will make the judge <em>quite angry</em>.
</li><li> Plutonium is possibly the most valuable substance by mass on the planet, partially because of its sheer destructive potential in nuclear weapons, but also partially due to the sheer amount of investment you have to make in order to synthesize it (any plutonium that naturally existed in the Earth's crust at the time of its formation has long since decayed to mere trace-amounts, so the only way to obtain it is to bombard a lighter element with neutrons until it transmutes into a plutonium isotope). Its value exceeds that of gold by a few orders of magnitude at least. This is why at Los Alamos at least one dummy core<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note102gzn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note102gzn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note102gzn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In nuclear weapons, a "core" is a spherical casting of plutonium. In order to make the big boom this core is compressed uniformly by conventional explosives until it achieves a supercritical state</span> was fabricated out of gold, on loan from the Federal Reserve. These dummy cores were intended for training people on how to handle the real thing <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11xxez');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11xxez" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11xxez');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">plutonium is extremely dense so the cores are a lot heavier than they look, and as they are both radioactive and extremely chemically toxic they must be handled with extreme care</span>, to test core fit within the complete bomb assembly, and so on. One half of one such core ended up being used as a door stop. If anybody was going to steal material from the lab, they'd go for the far more valuable plutonium than the boring old gold.
<ul><li> Similarly, the uranium enrichment plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee required gigantic electromagnets to separate uranium isotopes. Because copper was a critical material for the war effort (not just wiring, but also engine radiators, brass shell casings, bronze gears and ship propellers, etc.), somebody suggested silver be used (silver actually has slightly higher conductivity than copper, but of course copper is much more plentiful and inexpensive). The US Treasury was contacted, and the Army Corps of Engineers arranged to 'borrow' tons of silver bullion to be drawn into wires and wound into magnets. True to their word, after the magnetic separation was superseded by the more-efficient gaseous diffusion process, the magnets were dismantled and the silver returned to the Treasury.
