</li><li> In his true form, Chrono from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em> behaves rather like this. Although he has a violent temper when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">pushed too far</a>, he genuinely doesn't want to hurt anyone and is often shown regretting the battles he takes a part of.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>: Umibozu, at least when he's not pissed or trying to kill you, is a very gentle person, in spite of his size and intimidating looks.
</li><li> It is hinted that Dauf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> was like that when he was a human, and later a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-yoma warrior</a>. However, when he became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceMonsterTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceMonsterTurn">Awakened Being</a>, his personality became significantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">more evil</a>.

He's HUGE, has a mohawk and possesses super strength and stamina even bigger than 009's, yet he's a very level-headed and soft-spoken pacifist and very often is the voice of reason in the team.
</li><li> Tionishia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl">Daily Life with Monster Girl</a></em> is an eight-foot-tall ogre girl who also happens to be the friendliest and most personable member of her team, despite being their primary muscle. There's even an entire chapter devoted to her "calming aura", which all but sucks the stress and/or anger out of anyone spending time with her. In general Ogres, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Oni">Oni</a> (who are generally smaller), Trolls (who are bigger <em>and</em> brawnier), and Gigantes (literal giants that stand on average 10 meters/ 32 feet) are extremely docile and the Gigantes largely spend their days sitting around wearing rags while they wait for something to do.

But he gets a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet The Bird</a> moments, drops his homicide mission in order to try to kill the main villain, Cell, and eventually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attempts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, which turns out to be futile, except for pushing Gohan into enough of a rage to go Super Saiyan 2.</span>

A tall, imposing figure who happens to look exactly like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrankensteinsMonster">Frankenstein's Monster</a> and was built to be a destructive killing machine, but is ultimately a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Still, whatever you do, don't put his friends in danger.</a> General White learned this the hard way.
</li><li> The Ox King. He starts out of a big, strong guy with a reputation for being a bloodthirsty monster, but quickly defends Goku. He spends most of his appearances over the franchise as a doting grandfather.
</li><li> Despite being really tall strong fighter possessing immesurable amounts of mutant power, unlike other Saiyans Broly is a peaceful kind-hearted warrior who only fight because his father ordered him. Even Goku recognizes this as he tries to talk him out of fighting before befriending him in the end.
</li></ul></li><li> Ooshima, the huge high school athlete from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Emerging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Emerging">Emerging</a></em>. Exemplified by his shy/loving relationship with his girlfriend Misaki whose only about half as tall and wide as the shoulder as her boyfriend, this couple make a very cute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeGuyTinyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HugeGuyTinyGirl">Huge Guy, Tiny Girl</a> couple.

<ul><li> Kurita. His teammates are terrified... of his <em>hugs</em>.
</li><li> Subverted with Kurita's rival Gao, while having Kurita's size (spread out differently of course) is definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> "Beast Arm" Elfman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>.
<ul><li> Makarov is an inversion. He's normally kind and gentle, when he's two feet tall, but when he uses his Titan Magic, it means he's about to kick someone's ass.
</li><li> Also Gildarts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fudoh, a giant Goshasei warrior that towers over even <em>Raoh</em>. Oh, and he's the gentle and loving caretaker of many orphaned children. Fudoh goes on to prove not only in size is he the bigger man, but is the first to truly instill fear in Raoh. The conversation that Foudoh has with Raoh is to the effect of him showing that his (Fudoh's) children are his REAL treasure and as such Raoh, whom believes that by the power of his Ken (fist) only the world will be changed, has absolutely nothing to match.
</li><li> Shuh and Toki also follow this trope to a less obvious degree, although not quite as tall.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> Alphonse Elric. A young boy whose soul is attached to a giant suit of armor, he is kind to <em>everyone</em> and loves cats, having a tendency of picking up strays and hiding them inside himself. When he does get riled up, he's at least as good a fighter as his brother...but his mind and soul are still those of a young boy. The armor makes it easy to forget that.
</li><li> Alex Louis Armstrong also fits this role like a glove. Despite his immense raw power and efficiency on the battlefield, ultimately, it's Armstrong's compassion for the enemy that's preventing him from ever being promoted. He is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">easily moved to tears</a>, and cares a great deal about the Elric brothers.
</li><li> Sig Curtis, a huge butcher and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> who's very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to the Elrics' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> mentor Izumi, is also a total sweetheart... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">unless you threaten Izumi or someone he and Izumi care for, that is.</a>

<ul><li> Batou claims that shooting guns and hand to hand combat aren't really his strength, but that he really specializes in negotiation. Although this is not backed up by what we see in the series so it's more than likely that he was being sarcastic. Which becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a> if you consider his and Togusas visit to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> to "just talk" in <em>Innocence</em>. Less than ten seconds into the scene he start blowing the place apart with a belt-fed machine gun. Or the manga, where he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">casually tortures a bad guy brutally for information.</a> He has more than his fair share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moments. Big guy almost tears up a few times and his relationship with the Tachikomas, combined with babying them with natural oil, is implied to be what gives them ghosts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed">Ginga Densetsu Weed</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rocket. While not buff, he's very tall and one of the sweetest dogs in Weed's pack after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.
</li><li> Ben also qualifies, as do the massive Fighting dogs Weed recruits to his team. In fact almost all the larger dogs on Weed's side qualify as this, while the smaller ones like Silver tend to be Tiny Terrors.
</li><li> Moss from the prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin">Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin</a></em>, definitely qualifies. Despite his massive size (being an English Mastiff and all), he's extremely gentle towards the puppy Chibi (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tesshin</span>) and treats him like a second son.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Haikyuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Haikyuu">Haikyuu!!</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Asahi Azumane</a> from Karasuno. He's the biggest guy on the team and is subject to several awful rumors that he's a delinquent much older than he really is. But anyone who knows him knows he's an incredibly sensitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward">Lovable Coward</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">wouldn't hurt a fly</a>, unlike his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">Nishinoya</a>.
</li><li> Takanobu Aone from Date Tech. He's a silent, massive guy with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">Face of a Thug</a> who, unfortunately for his teammates, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">Does Not Know His Own Strength</a>. Aone's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">vicious opponent</a> on the court, but he also shows visible concern for his team and forms an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a> with the rather little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival">Hinata</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Jason Ozma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em> looks like a huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Scary Black Man</a>, but is <em>extremely</em> gentle and polite even to his rivals... Which leads to a hilarious scene in his introduction to Ippo.
</li><li> Zaitsu Misao of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HatsukoiLimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HatsukoiLimited">Hatsukoi Limited</a></em> is a great example of this trope. He loves birds and small creatures, and is incredibly gentle except when forced to fight, but his immense size and death glare scare even the bravest critters away.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, Father Alexander Anderson is an 8-foot tall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyHitman">Holy Hitman</a> who functions as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a> for the Catholic Church and their legion of trained assassins. The majority of his time onscreen involves slaughtering vampires, regenerating hacked-off limbs, and going toe-to-toe with Alucard, Hellsing's nigh-invincible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>. However, it's also shown that Anderson <em>adores</em> children and spends whatever time he's not hunting the undead back in Rome, where he runs an orphanage and plays surrogate father to dozens of children.
</li><li> The Daidarabochi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube">Hell Teacher Nube</a></em> is a literal giant, over ten stories tall, with the supernatural ability to rearrange the topography of a region as though it had always been like that. Miki Hosokawa, one of Nube's students, is able to call on it for a little while in order to improve the landscape of Domori to her liking: such as widening the streets to make them safer, moving a construction site so it won't deprive some flowers of sunlight, and taking a communications tower from the city out to the countryside just so the baby birds nesting there have a better environment to grow up in. Unfortunately for her sanity, she's the only one who remembers the previous look of the city, so nobody (not even Nube) believes the story of Daidarabochi, at least until it saves her from falling when she tries to climb up to the nest herself.
</li><li> The producer in the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheIdolmasterCinderellaGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheIdolmasterCinderellaGirls">THE iDOLM@STER: Cinderella Girls</a></em> towers over most others and looks fearsome, but in actuality he's an awkward person who doesn't have much to say, and mostly acts kindly towards others.
</li><li> Gakushuu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em>: Big and muscle-bound, but really a nice guy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">with a fondness for sweets</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">hanyou</a> Jinenji has a giant monstrous form due to his half-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> heritage and yet all he wants to do is heal people.
</li><li> In the anime, Sesshoumaru's two-headed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDragonsAreDifferent">dragon</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseOfADifferentColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseOfADifferentColor">horse</a> pet is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">turned into this</a>. The anime gives him the name Ah-Un and turns him into a gentle herbivore despite his pointed teeth and ability to shoot lightning and energy blasts from both mouths.
</li></ul></li><li> At age 19, Jonathan Joestar of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood</a></em> is 195 centimeters (just under 6 feet 4 inches) and has the physique of a bodybuilder, but is a very kind-hearted gentleman and is willing to forgive almost anyone, the sole exception being Tarukus (who was extremely sadistic and only cared about killing). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He even dies clutching Dio Brando's disembodied head and acknowledging him as a brother, despite the latter having made his life Hell since the two met. It's even reciprocated — when Jonathan dies, Dio looks absolutely <em>heartbroken</em>.</span>
</li><li> Both twin sisters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsKichijojiTheOnlyPlaceToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsKichijojiTheOnlyPlaceToLive">Is Kichijoji the Only Place to Live?</a></em> but Tomiko in particular. She looks very intimidating thanks to her height, size and blank expression but she wouldn't hurt a fly.
</li><li> Narumi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KarakuriCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KarakuriCircus">Karakuri Circus</a></em> qualifies; he's a massive martial artist, and even has a rough attitude and temper, but he will never harm someone who doesn't deserve it in the utmost.
</li><li> Muay Thai god of Death Apachai Hopachai, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KenichiTheMightiestDisciple">Kenichi: The Mightiest Disciple</a></em>, has this trope's name carved in his forehead.
</li><li> Just about any "cultured" Zentradi on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> after the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>.

<ul><li> Especially shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>, seeing as the majority of Zentradi tend to be average people who just happen to make normal-sized people look like dolls next to them. A specific example being Alto and Sheryl hanging out with Klan, with the former two having to be on a third story just to talk face to face with the latter.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">Zafira</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>.

Considering the fact that he helps babysit Vivio in the anime, that's not hard to believe and as the Yagami family-centric M4 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudioAdaptation">Sound Stage</a> shows, he spends his free time playing around with the neighborhood kids and teaching them magic or martial arts (formally opening up a children's dojo by the time of <em>ViVid</em>). This is also the only time he's out of his wolf form after he joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">the TSAB</a>.

</li><li> Argo Gulskii from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em>. Very smart, quiet, scary-looking — and the most level-headed, gentler of the Shuffle Alliance.
</li></ul></li><li> Wolfgang Grimmer, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em>; huge (primarily in height, but he <em>is</em> clearly very strong as well) and also an incredibly sweet-natured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Woobie</a>.

</li><li> Golem of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em>, for sure. A hulking, solid stone, superstrong animated statue that looks like a frowning samurai on steroids? But he's gentle, thoughtful (he's introduced carefully tending for a flower)...but, as with so many of his kind, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> danger. Do <em>not</em>, under any circumstances, <em>ever</em> threaten anyone or anything that he cares for.
</li><li> Takeo Goda, the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLoveStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyLoveStory">My Love Story!!</a></em> is a high school student standing six-and-a-half feet tall, and is built like a gorilla (several bystanders and side-characters frequently likening him to a bear as well). He's also very careful and considerate, making sure to never use his size or strength to hurt anyone.
</li><li> Totoro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a></em>.

</li><li> Gantetsu, from the anime-only Shinobazu arc, rescues and protects the children orphaned by the Shinobazu gang (of which he is a member).

When he's kid-sized, he warms up to Sueko rather quickly and gets along with her and the other scientists pretty easily. After he becomes a giant and goes on the run, the two-story-tall and still growing Frankenstein mostly avoids people and he even happily watches villagers go about their day at one point. He shows his loyalty to Sueko by going back to her apartment to see her again after escaping the lab, and later coming to her rescue when Baragon is about to eat her. The 66 feet tall Frankenstein goes on to risk his life to protect humanity from the ravenous Baragon. If one wants to stay on his good side, just don't shine bright lights in his face, attack him, threaten Sueko or people in general.
</li><li> The <em>Giant of Thunder Mountain's</em> title character easily fits this trope.

While he has his moments of Wookie rage, mostly he is a very loving and gentle creature, even snuggling with Han Solo during <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.

Everything he says comes out as a polite suggestion, and he bears no malice toward anyone in the film.

<ul><li> Many civilized trolls adopt a Gentle Giant demeanour when dealing with other, more breakable races, but mostly out of convenience, not niceness. One member of the City Watch, though, a troll constable named Bluejohn, is the largest the commander of the Watch has ever seen, much bigger even than normal trolls, and "like many big people" is really quite gentle and diffident. He's so massive and tough he can function as an impromptu riot shield for a squad of coppers. However, this is by no means universal, as plenty of trolls find employment as hired goons, and there are more than a few troll criminal masterminds who operate out of the meat refrigeration areas.
</li><li> Also, Captain Carrot is six-feet-six, broad-shouldered, and immensely strong due to growing up in a dwarven mine, but he's just about the nicest guy you'll ever meet. In early books he avoids fights altogether because a lot of people take one look at him and decide <em>maybe</em> having a go at him isn't a good idea, in later ones his incredible charisma does pretty much the same thing

So far he is also quite possibly the strongest person/thing on the watch, as golems have been described as capable of ripping trolls in half. While golems in general are this way because they have the functional equivalent of the Three Laws embedded in their heads, Dorfl does <em>not</em>, and is very specifically nonviolent by choice alone. When he was first "freed" he went around and exacted revenge on a number of his former masters. But the worst he did was dress up a slaughterhouse owner with an apple in his mouth and a carrot "somewhere else", and free all the animals.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em>: The giant Morgante is one of Alonso Quixanos favorite characters, because despite being a giant (and in the chivalry books all giants are arrogant and angry), he is affable and well bred The whole point is that Alonso Quixano thinks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchetypalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchetypalCharacter">this kind of character</a> is original to his beloved chivalry books, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">really its not</a>. This trope was a cliché even when Don Quixote was written, in 1605, as we can see in Part I, Chapter I, Alonso Quixano:
<div class="indent"><em>" approved highly of the giant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred."</em>
</div></li><li> Father Roche in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoomsdayBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoomsdayBook">Doomsday Book</a></em> is a gentle, meek and almost inhumanly patient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd">Good Shepherd</a>. Kivrin describes him as having enormous hands and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">Face of a Thug</a>. Late in the book she remarks how tiny she is compared to him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> Harry Dresden is, by his own description, NBA tall, being a little bit short of 7 feet tall. He's not particularly bulky, but is generally in quite good shape, usually has a gun on him, and eventually gets a decent amount of hand-to-hand and staff fighting training in as well. He's also one of the most powerful Wizards on the planet with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">penchant for fire magic</a> and has been scrapping with Dark Wizards and supernatural monsters since he was a teenager. He has no problem with killing if the situation warrants it, extending <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to an act of complete <em>genocide</em></span>. In short, people who cross him have a tendency not to survive a whole lot longer. He's also a total dork, a massive nerd and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>. When all is said and done, he's happiest making cheese jokes, hanging out with his friends and playing tabletop role playing games, reading books, going to drive-in movies or researching the Art (magic).
</li><li> Harry's dog Mouse is much like his master. He's nearly four feet at the shoulder, weighing in at 200 something pounds and is also a magic foo-dog apparently powerful enough that an Archangel refers to him as "little cousin" and his mere presence terrifies a Fallen Angel. If there is not threat, however, he becomes a goofy, adorable fuzzbucket whose great delights in life are scritches, people food and rides in the car. He has even managed to melt the hearts of people who are phobic about large dogs. Due to his Magical nature, Harry suspects Mouse is far actually very intelligent (and he's almost certainly correct).
</li><li> Harry's friend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">Knight in Shining Armor</a> Michael Carpenter also counts. He's only a bit shorter than Harry and significantly more muscular and wields a holy sword (that may or may not be Excalibur) as a Knight of the Cross, meaning he basically goes around the world fighting Fallen Angels and saving people, at least when he isn't at his day job as a carpenter. He's also probably the single kindest person Harry knows, a loving father, great friend and generally all around good man, as evidenced by the fact that the Archangel Uriel considers him a personal friend.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonBones">Dragon Bones</a></em>, the protagonist Ward is this. He mainly uses his size advantage to carry wounded people and animals, or protect people by simply being there and looking intimidating. His father averts the trope by being the tallest man around, and a jerk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEdgeChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEdgeChronicles">The Edge Chronicles</a></em> gives us an entire species of these in the banderbears, who stick out all the more in the Deepwoods. So long as you don't mess with them, they're affectionate teddy bears who happen to be the size of grizzlies (and have sharp tusks). When Twig has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion">Androcles' Lion</a> moment with one in the first book, he ends up befriending the lot of them by extension — generations later, they remember the word "friend" he taught them.
</li><li> Sea Serpents described in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FantasticBeastsAndWhereToFindThem">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></em> can grow up to 100 feet long (to a Blue Whale's 98) but there is no record of them ever harming a person, or in the author's opinion, no credible record.

The reason is complicated, but it involves an ancient curse.
</li><li> From Glen Cook's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI">Garrett, P.I.</a></em> series we have seven- (or nine, if you ask Garrett) foot-tall imposing black man named Playmate, who does not have "a mean bone in his body" and Saucerhead Tharpe who, while earning a living as a strongarm specialist, is very civil to the people he knocks out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GirlWaitsWithGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GirlWaitsWithGun">Girl Waits With Gun</a></em> tells the story of Constance Kopp, A hulking farmgirl who only wants people to leave her family alone.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodDogCarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodDogCarl">Good Dog, Carl!</a></em> is a Rottweiler who babysits a little girl named Madeline.
</li><li> Joe from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatExpectations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreatExpectations">Great Expectations</a></em> fits this trope. He doesn't hurt anyone, except Orlick who he knocks out in one punch after Orlick kept insulting his wife.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books

</li><li> Though he's very much <em>not</em> one in his first appearance, Grawp, Hagrid's half-brother, learns by Hagrid's patient and determined example to be a Gentle Giant, at least when dealing with people. If the people he cares for are hurt or killed, he is the first to utterly break down crying. He's much more tender and caring than any of the main characters.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSquid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSquid">Giant Squid</a> living in the Hogwarts lake seems to be a friendly monster — it's first introduced putting an overboard student back in the boat, and Fred and George have been seen tickling it. Although Harry still hopes not to see it when he swims in the Hogwarts lake.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a></em>:
<ul><li> In their native home, the Hyperborean giants are peaceful. Percy and Co. still use one to help them escape from some griffins.
</li><li> Tyson also technically counts.

</li></ul></li><li> Ward of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hurog">Hurog</a></em> is a very kind person, who is protective of his younger siblings and pretty much everyone who is there to be protected. He is described as having the stature of an ox by less nice people, and nicknamed "giant of [his homeland]" by nicer ones.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a> series: Leonardo is very much this. Dr. Mira even refers to him as such in <em>Vengeance in Death</em>. Crack can also be, as long as you don't piss him off. Then he becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Scary Black Man</a>.

They're eventually rallied into war, but it takes a <em>lot</em> of talk.
<ul><li> The Lonely Troll in the poem of the same name qualifies. Unlike most trolls, he doesn't steal gold, drink beer, or eat meat, but everyone's scared of him. To the only person who isn't scared, he teaches the secret of making the best bread anyone ever baked.

He's a big burly man, and furthermore is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Pewterarm</a>, or as they are more commonly known, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Thug</a>. He's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> (the only protagonist to be so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> for most of the series</span>) and loves to debate philosophy with anyone who's interested. Or who can't run away.
</li><li> Lauchlan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MixBeerWithLiquorAndYouWillGetSicker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MixBeerWithLiquorAndYouWillGetSicker">Mix Beer With Liquor And You Will Get Sicker</a></em> is described as being 62 tall, broad shouldered and having prominent facial scarring, and is soft-spoken and kind-hearted to a fault. He adores the draught horses he cares for, and will normally put their own needs before his own. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KindheartedCatLover">Same with his cat</a>.
</li><li> Queequeg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick">Moby-Dick</a></em> is a pretty intimidating guy: tall and strong, decked out in tribal tattoos, has filed-sharp teeth, a partially shaved head, and is always seen toting around his beloved harpoon. Ishmael was initially terrified of Queequeg, but became fast friends with him after discovering how kind and polite he really was. Also many of the whales are portrayed as such, only fighting back when the whalers strike first.
</li><li> Mr. Tall in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MrMen">Mr. Men</a></em> series, though he's only a giant because of his long legs. He is very self-conscious about his height, and has to be convinced by the other characters that it has any advantages.
</li><li> In Robert Asprin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth Adventures</a></em> series, one of the members of M.Y.T.H. Inc., is Chumley, a huge green-furred troll. Although he works as muscle-for-hire under the persona of 'Big Crunch,' he's actually the most erudite and poetic of the M.Y.T.H. Inc. crew.
</li><li> The Giants in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Narnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Narnia">Narnia</a></em> are usually depicted as dumb or evil (especially in <em>The Silver Chair</em>), but in the second book (<em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em>) we meet a very gentle and polite one: Rumblebuffin, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">Taken for Granite</a> by Jadis the Witch <em>especially</em> because of this. Aslan revives him and he joins the cause of the Pevensies immediately.
<ul><li> The Giants in <em>The Silver Chair</em> are ironically the ones referred to as 'Gentle Giants'. While they are far gentler and more refined then their brutish cousins, few of them show qualms against eating weaker, sentient beings.
</li></ul></li><li> The literary archetype for this sort of character is probably Lennie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMen">Of Mice &amp; Men</a></em>, by John Steinbeck. Averted shockingly at the end when he assaults Curley's wife (after she lets him touch her hair, then panics) and flees into the countryside. His travelling companion George follows him and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoots him dead to prevent the posse lynching him instead</span>. It's also strongly implied that this is not the first time Lennie has done something of this sort. Although he's more of a subversion of the whole "gentle" part, seeing how many animals he kills by accident.
</li><li> Adzel in the <em>Polesotechnic League</em> series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PoulAnderson">Poul Anderson</a>. He's a sort of huge mix of a dragon and a centaur, he looks like a bloodthirsty scaly monster, yet he's a pacifist scholar following the buddhist doctrines. You can't blame him for his size, after all.
</li><li> Fezzik from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>. His backstory mentions that he can rip a tree up by the roots, but he's scared of the bugs that live among said roots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedCountry">Red Country</a></em>: Subverted by Lamb. Shy notes that the hulking man may be the most timid and cowardly person she's ever met. He spends all his efforts working the farm and being a tender <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> for her and her young siblings. However, it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's actually a retired Logen Ninefingers, the most violent and bloodthirsty bastard in the North, and perhaps the whole world. When circumstances turn desperate, he reveals that he can and will kill anything that moves</span>.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>'s novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Roadmarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Roadmarks">Roadmarks</a></em>, Mondamay is a large alien robot with the power to obliterate entire planets, but finds himself left behind by his creators due to a malfunction. He becomes a potter and lives a peaceful life until reactivated by an assassin and ordered to kill a friend.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap">Septimus Heap</a></em> series with the dragon Spit Fyre, since while he's depicted as being rather gentle in the first books, in <em>Darke</em> it's mentioned that he nearly ate a person who had run into his Dragon House for a dare.
</li><li> Longinus Podbipięta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SienkiewiczTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SienkiewiczTrilogy">With Fire and Sword</a></em> is huge, carries a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">BFS</a> his ancestor got at Grunwald, but he's only sent on a mission against brigands once, since he just let all the captives go.

<ul><li> Hodor is almost seven feet tall but has the mind of a young child. He's timid, frightened easily, and completely incapable of defending himself.
</li><li> Brienne of Tarth stands at roughly 6'6" and a lean 250-300 lbs, and has a keg-shaped head, a barrel chest with thick, rippling pecs and narrow hips instead of teats and curves, shoulders so wide and heavy with muscle that they are "hunched" under their own weight, a bull neck, and hands and feet so enormous they are comparable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Gregor Clegane's</a> in size and shape. She's also one of the sweetest, most kind-hearted characters in the series, unswervingly loyal, and truly lives up to the ideals of knighthood despite not actually being a knight.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSorceresssOrc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSorceresssOrc">The Sorceress's Orc</a></em>, orcs in general tend to be this. They look like stereotypical orcs, big, broad and with dangerous teeth, but aren't more aggressive than humans, rather less. The titular orc, who is the sorceress' bodyguard, mentions that his parents wanted him to become a smith and were rather disappointed when he chose to become a mercenary. Despite his career choice one doesn't get the impression that he is fond of killing people, and it often happens that his employer gets more obviously angry at the anti-orc racism than he does.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em> there is the character of Tom Cullen: a big, strong, friendly man with a mild case of mental disability. Tom is so gentle that he would never dream of commiting violence, and possesses a child-like sense of innocence and wonder.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Temeraire">Temeraire</a></em>: The dragon Kulingile hatches as a deformed runt and develops a quiet, shy, gentle personality, which he retains even after growing to become the largest dragon in Britain. However, when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider">Dragon Rider</a> or the rider's brother is threatened, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">becomes an unstoppable force of destruction</a>.
</li><li> Boo Radley from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></em> Throughout the majority of the novel, the kids have no idea what he looks like, and fear him greatly. The simple act of touching his house is a feat for them. But in the end, he's revealed to be a nice, timid, harmless man, as he saves Jem from Bob Ewell (albeit by killing him) and makes his appearance known. (Although, in the film version, he's really not so big.)
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ukridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ukridge">Ukridge</a></em> stories, Wilberforce Billson defaults to this. Ukridge sees Billson's potential as a boxer, and tries to make a bit of money by managing him in the ring, but in "The Debut of Battling Billson", Billson lets himself be defeated out of sympathy for his opponent's hard-life story, and in "The Exit of Battling Billson", Billson refuses to fight at all on religious grounds. If provoked to the point where he loses his temper, however, it's a different story — in "The Return of Battling Billson", he demolishes his opponent (although this is no comfort to Ukridge, who had wanted him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingTheFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingTheFight">take a dive</a> that time).
</li><li> In <em>The Wanderer</em> and <em>The Adventurer</em> by Mika Waltari, Antti the Cannoncaster is almost superhumanly strong, and very tall. Despite sometimes accidentally breaking things (sometimes people's necks, for example...) he is not violent by nature and is, all things considered, a somewhat docile person. The protagonist/narrator thinks him dumb as well, but the reader may well disagree, as he can both use his incredible strength as a means of subtle threats, and can think on his feet very admirably. At some point one starts to wonder whether he prefers to keep up a facade of stupidity to get into less trouble, but he might just refuse to keep up a facade of intelligence like the narrator, Mikael, does. As a character, Antti is very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a>-like, and sort of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> to the sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a> protagonist.

</li><li> Lowbacca from the <em>Young Jedi Knights</em> series is Chewbacca's nephew and a promising Jedi apprentice.

<ul><li> David Palmer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> is an example of this trope. He acts that way at times and he's not particularly vicious.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ray Palmer. He's tall and muscular, but one of the most genuinely nice characters in the show. Subverted in that no one actually seems frightened of or intimidated by him.
</li><li> The same goes for Diggle, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">The Lancer</a> of Team Arrow, but is also the guy who keeps Oliver from going too far and is a very loving father.

He is also revealed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a> in episodes that feature his skills as an electronics and gadgetry whiz. He also shows the gentle side in any episode dealing with kids. Of course, this is also true of the actor in real life, so it fits. (As well as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">his cartoon show</a>.)
</li><li> Olag Gan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>, who is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a> due to having his brain altered by the Federation.
</li><li> Hoss Cartwright from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza">Bonanza</a></em> fits the trope; a truly strong fellow whose love for children and all round sweet nature are always in evidence, in addition, he is quite naïve. However, any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">bully</a> pushing around an innocent around him is going to regret it most forcefully.
</li><li> Frankie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em> is ultimately revealed to be one when he has a good influence.

<ul><li> Jaime Palillo. Big, strong, loud, gluttonous — but friendly towards everyone, laid back, always in a good mood, and <em>never</em> tolerant of any bullshit against his friends.
</li><li> Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">In the Blood</a>, actually: his parents are seen on-screen, and both Mr. and Mrs. Palillo are just as large and kindhearted as their son.

Of course, he more than once beats Don Ramón, especially when he thinks Don Ramón is promoting boxing among the children, which according to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">is encouraging violence</a>.

<ul><li> The massive Detective Vera fits this trope. Despite being snarky, he's amazingly good with children and as Rush tells a rape victim: "He only <em>looks</em> like a Neanderthal."
</li><li> Subverted in <em>Metamorphosis</em>. The Circus Giant everybody thought was mentally handicapped and a gentle soul, was actually highly intelligent and a cold-blooded murderer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nick Stokes. Evident when Greg Sanders is attacked in the episode "Fannysmackin'"; normally a gentle soul, Nick went berserk at the kids who were taunting him. For a few seasons, some fans joked that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">constantly tormented</a> Nick would have his "Day of Justice."
</li><li> Grissom himself is almost never angry. However, if you press <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">just the right button</a>, such as by selling drugs to kids, Grissom may lose his cool and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible">go into quite the rage</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Archie "Snake" Simpson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em>. Minus the "not book smart" part in this case (one of the smart kids in the '80s version, he comes back as a teacher and makes principal well before age 40).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> Toberman from the story "The Tomb of the Cybermen".

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Buttons</a> are his missing arm (which his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> superior uses to blackmail him), and that time that Solon effectively betrayed him by offering him up as a replacement sacrifice to the Sisterhood of Karn in exchange for the Doctor's life (Or, at least, his head).

</li><li> Who could forget <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a> Robert from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em>? He's massive, hulking, sometimes seen as dull-witted but actually very smart in many situations, became a cop, and is one of the gentlest guys you will ever meet, both in the show and reality.
</li><li> D'Argo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a>.</em> Though he was primarily a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poet</a>, he tended to be very much a gentle giant around children — his friendship with Cyntrina in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Different</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Destinations</a>" being the most obvious example.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>: Hodor, the gigantic, simple-minded servant who is scared of thunder and unable to defend himself unless he is controlled by Bran. This was probably the reason he was chosen to carry Bran around. Also, despite finding himself in increasingly dangerous circumstances, he continually refuses to hurt anyone, and was extremely reluctant to take one of Sam's dragonglass knives and only did so on Bran's insistence. In "Oathkeeper", he can't bring himself to fight back against the Night's Watch mutineers. In "The First of his Name", he is utterly horrified after being forced via warging to kill Locke. In "The Children", he can't bring himself to fight back against <em>wights</em>. However, in "Home", it is shown that back when he was Wylis, he was eager to train and spar with the other children, but Old Nan scolded him and told him not to participate in foolishness.
</li><li> There is a reason Finn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> has been called Frankenteen.
<ul><li> David Karofsky, after experiencing a change of heart, is also shown to be sensitive and gentle on the inside. Aw.
</li></ul></li><li> Monroe on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>; played by the very tall Silas Wier Mitchell. Clockmaker, cellist, gourmet vegan chef, geeks out in decorating for both Hallowe'en and Christmas, beloved by the children of the neighborhood (except for the bullies). Also is a retired werewolf.
</li><li> The Cyclops in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em>, the episode with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> is that people should not be judged by their looks, the Cyclops is a monstrous giant, but is a nice guy.
</li><li> Marshall from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>. He's played by 6'4" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonSegel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonSegel">Jason Segel</a>, but he's the most sentimental (and sympathetic) character on the show, but winds up coming in handy when Ted and Barney try to pick a fight outside the bar.
</li><li> Mr. J from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider555" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider555">Kamen Rider 555</a></em> is probably this too. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">large, powerful black man</a>...who is mainly working for the bad guys because he's forced to. He's shown to be a very sweet guy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">loves his doggy</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouFerrigno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouFerrigno">Lou Ferrigno</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingOfQueens">The King of Queens</a></em>, lampshaded in the quote above. (Despite the fact that he used to play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk1977" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheIncredibleHulk1977">The Incredible Hulk (1977)</a></em>.)

</li><li> Eliot Spencer on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a>.</em> He's not big heightwise but he's solid muscle and a powerful fighter, which is what makes him such an effective "hitter" for the merry band of do-gooding criminals. "Mushy" attributes include a love of cooking (he's a Master Chef), a fondness for children, and proclaiming his favorite movie is <em>Casablanca.</em>
</li><li> The overweight lovable slob Hurley from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LOST" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LOST">Lost</a></em> fits this to a T — he's also quite resourceful. He made a golf course on the island early on.
</li><li> Willy on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> mostly fits, although it can be assumed he was just as intelligent as the others.
</li><li> Herman Munster of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters">The Munsters</a></em>, definitely. Body of Frankenstein's Monster, personality of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a>.
<ul><li> Really, most anyone played by Fred Gwynne qualifies. His 6'5" frame, baritone voice, and pleasant, shy nature made him a natural for these parts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em>'s Bull Shannon. He's a 6'8", bald, muscular, very intimidating guy who's strong enough to crush a bowling ball in his bare hands (seriously, he did just that in one episode), and he's one of the nicest guys you'd ever meet, so nice that more than one young mother has hired him to babysit their children.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NurseJackie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NurseJackie">Nurse Jackie</a></em> has this in the form of Thor, a tall, imposing dude who is sweet as sugar, cute as a button, and gay as a glittery top hat. Calling out "Thor!" in an early episode brings him looming, scaring off the creep, and when Jackie says "Thank you," he spins around with a perky "No problem!"
</li><li> Matt from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OperationRepo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OperationRepo">Operation Repo</a></em> (minus the the "don't push him" part). The guy is a big bald dude with tree-trunk arm who runs and hides at the first sign of trouble. At one point he began crying after being shot with pepper spray (actually crying, as in "boo-hoo".)
</li><li> Kubiak from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParkerLewisCantLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParkerLewisCantLose">Parker Lewis Can't Lose</a></em>, although he starts as a bully. Abraham Benrubi, the actor for Larry "Kube" Kubiak often plays this role, and is noted in the Real Life section for also being this.
</li></ul><ul><li> Dagwood from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeaQuestDSV">seaQuest DSV</a>/2032</em> was a failed prototype of a brand of genetically engineered soldiers. Not only was his intelligence lower than his creators expected, he was so gentle that when the rest of the crew had their aggression heightened, he remained the same because there was "not a mean bone" in him.
</li></ul><ul><li> Teal'c from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>: former First Prime of Apophis, crack shot with a staff weapon or a machine gun, stronger than dirt. At the end of one episode, he gives a little girl a honkin' huge water gun, then pulls out one of his own. Much hilarity ensues.
</li><li> The giant at the beginning of the Season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>. He's a lot more mild-mannered than most of the other residents of the Black Lodge, and is implied to be some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> as well given the helpful advice he gives Agent Cooper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/UltraSeries">Ultra Series</a></em>: The Ultramen, who are 40-60 meter tall alien giants composed of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsGood">light</a> and have dedicated themselves to protecting humanity and the universe from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">kaiju</a> and evil aliens. Occasionally, some of the kaiju can be this as well, which in that case, the Ultras and defense team will usually have to assist them somehow.
</li><li> Conrad from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WildBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WildBoys">Wild Boys</a></em>. The biggest of the bushrangers, he is the only one who isn't an outlaw at heart; having being forced to give up an honest trade (farrier) and turn criminal when he was framed for a crime he did not commit.
</li><li> Goliath in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em> is a gentle, good-hearted family man forced to fight David.

As with all marines they tower over an unmodified human. Unlike other marines, due to their Father Primarch Vulkan and the radiation of his home planet of Nocturne, they have literal coal black skin and bright red eyes. Their use of flame weapons and fearsome looks have stopped more than one rebellion before it had even started. Despite this they and their Primarch have a lot of empathy and compassion towards normal humans and will butt heads with other marines, such as the Space Wolves, if innocent lives are threatened. All of these qualities stemming from Vulkan himself.

Giants typically keep to themselves and don't interact much with the other races. As long as they are not provoked (by attacking them directly, attacking their mammoth herds, or by entering their camps) they generally will not attack. That said, they do provide aversions in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenVillainy">Offscreen Villainy</a>. Giants are known to raid farms, steal livestock, and attack settlements. However, outside of a few exceptions with justifications, Giants have not been seen attacking unprovoked in-game. Additionally, there are mentions of Giants attacking and even forming armies in the backstory. The ancient Giant Clan led by Sinmur the Terrible is one such example. Sinmur led <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">an army of hundreds of Giants</a> against the forces of the Atmoran <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Ysgramor</a> and his 500 Companions.

(The same Swinub is now a fully evolved Mamoswine, and before you rescue the Abomasnow, the Mamoswine is restless and upset because it knows that the current bad weather means its friend is in trouble.)

<div class="indent"> Like a hibernating bear, the Heavy appears to be a gentle giant. Also like a bear, confusing his deliberate, sleepy demeanor with gentleness will get you ripped limb from limb.

For instance, as a child, he buried a dead sparrow out of sorrow for it after another kid had killed it with a throwing knife at a training camp.
</li><li> The same can be said for the comics, where Heavy insults a child for expecting free candy on Halloween. When the kid starts to cry, Heavy frantically apologizes and gives him money.

Not only that, but a message left by him in his home shows that Asgore is willing to listen to people if they have a problem they need to talk about. That being said, Asgore can be challenging to fight and while he doesn't want to take your life and will try to delay the inevitable, circumstances dictate that he <em>must</em> kill you.</span>

He's shown to be fairly soft-spoken and level-headed on the show, but at a few other points is shown performing feats of immense strength, such as shrugging off a huge dog-pile of other ponies in "Lesson Zero" (sending several of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATwinkleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATwinkleInTheSky">flying over the horizon</a>), lifting up a cupboard with one single foreleg in "Pinkie Apple Pie", or towing a full house in "Hearts and Hooves Day"... while <em>skipping</em>.

Granted, this is because of her natural connection to animals and most of them wouldn't hesitate to cause trouble without her influence, but hardly any seemingly dangerous giant creature stays angry for long when Fluttershy's around.

And has a singing voice exactly like Robert Goulet. In one episode, though, a rumour starts that Mikey has pushed a boy into the girls' bathroom, which everyone believed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A rumour he started <em>himself</em>, mind.

However, he has a problem: one ingredient he needs is choke cherries, which don't grow in that part of the world. After realizing this, Gargamel decides to try using smurfberries, figuring that since the Smurfs used them for everything, why shouldn't they work? At first, they <em>do</em> work, and while the giant, whom he names Dufus, is a little dimwitted, he is more than willing to do what Gargamel tells him at first. Eventually, however, Dufus turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil">Minion with an F in Evil</a>, who is far too friendly to hurt anyone, due to the fact that Gargamel used smurfberries to create him.
</li><li> Knuckles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>. He's big, tall, and muscular, possesses incredible strength, loves punching things...but is also probably one of the friendliest characters on the show. Despite his tough appearance, he has a soft spot for nature, and is incredibly loyal to his friends.
</li><li> Hawk from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceRacers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpaceRacers">Space Racers</a></em>.
</li><li> Junko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks">Storm Hawks</a></em> is a textbook example, as he's a Class 2 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">Big Guy</a> who towers over most humans, but is considered a wussy weakling by his own kind.

</li><li> Memnock from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs">Super Noobs</a></em> is a tall alien who has many intimidating features such as fangs and claws but has a tender heart towards children such as the Noobs and he showed these traits in "I Know You Noob" as he tried to reason carefully with several little girls who were blackmailing the Noobs. He also turns out to have several traits of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampStraight">Camp Straight</a> as he loves cooking and made the infamous tiara jokes towards the Noobs. He also loves to eat candy, likes puppies whether real or stuffed, and likes to do childish activities
<ul><li> Zenblock, who is Memnock's comrade, recruiting partner, and roommate, may not seem to fit in this due to being a non romantic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>, combined with his intimidating Austrian accent, hot temper, manly personality, and having biological features similar to Memnock but Zenblock does have the capabilities of being gentle as he does care about the Noobs and saving the world and is just as childish as Memnock.

<ul><li> Thunder, looking past the fact that he and his brother Lightning love destroying every inanimate object in sight.
</li><li> And Red Star practically lives this trope, even though the alternative is so much easier.
</li><li> There's also Galfore, Starfire's <em>k'norfka</em> (guardian), a huge, hulking, intimidating guy, who's actually quite friendly and approachable — so long as you don't do anything that might be interpreted as a threat against Starfire. (Oddly enough, this is one of the few things that Beast Boy learns very quickly.)

The majority of the time, they're peaceful and <em>very</em> forgetful monks, spending their days meditating and the like. But, they're still Elephants.

</li><li> Mighty Manfred from <em>Tom Terrific.</em> Tom always touts him as a brainy intellect and fierce fighter, but all Manfred would rather do during the duo's adventures is sleep.
</li><li> DJ from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>. He's the largest and most muscular of the males but wouldn't hurt a fly. Owen is probably the heaviest character overall, and likewise sweet.
<ul><li> Rodney from the Pahkitew Island season. He's an extremely muscular farm boy who is very shy and falls in love with several girl contestants.
</li><li> Jasmine is one of the tallest contestants in the series and her size can scare other contestants but she has a tender heart towards animals, take the role of leader for her team, and managed to gain a love interest.

<ul><li> Omega Supreme in G1. Starfire, a pacifist and scientist with a stature that dwarfs Optimus Prime, also qualifies.
</li><li> Rhinox from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a> and both a tech-head and a spiritual guru. Push him just that one inch too far, though, and you'll find out just how tough he really is.
</li><li> Bulkhead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. He causes a lot of collateral damage despite his best efforts, though, mostly do to clumsiness, and it makes him kinda self-conscious.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He also turns out to be something of a super-tough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">Genius Ditz</a>, in that he's somehow the foremost expert on space bridges.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> His counterpart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> definitely fits this trope.
</li><li> Like the Discworld example above, most Autobot protagonists tend to use Gentle Giant mannerisms when dealing with humans. Decepticons...not so much. Except in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersShatteredGlass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TransformersShatteredGlass">Shattered Glass</a></em> universe, where, naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">it's reversed</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em>, the ogre Knut fits this Trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil">despite working for the bad guys.</a>
</li><li> Clay from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>, who's as sweet as a piece of ol' Aunt Nelly's homemade cherry pie. Seriously, he once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">refused to fight a villain</a>, instead defeating her by giving her a big hug.

When a tantrum he's thrown over being made fun of in the school cafeteria causes a building to collapse, he tries to protect her by shielding her with his own body, but she still gets struck in the head and knocked out, at which point he gently picks her up and takes her to an abandoned building, where he ties her up "to keep her safe", and promises to take care of her, setting up a candle-lit dinner for her and bringing her flowers and an old-fashioned gramophone to play soothing music for her, at which point Xavier's other students, most notably Cyclops (in angry protective boyfriend mode) blasts their way in to rescue her. The Blob ends up as a villain of the show, joining the Brotherhood, but every once in a while you still see a gentler, warmer side shine through, if only for a moment — specially in how he treats Todd "Toad" Tolansky, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, as a younger brother.

</li><li> On the subject of football, retired Chicago Bears fullback William "the Refrigerator" Perry. He got his nickname because he was huge, standing 6'2" (188 cm) and weighing over 300lbs through most of his career in football.

He was not a very brilliant general, but was reportedly the only one of the Marshals who never quarreled with any of his peers (even in Spain, where lack of collaboration proved the French's undoing), and even the meanest memorialists of the time cannot seem to find anything bad to say about his character.
</li><li> Bao Xishun, the tallest man in China and one of the tallest people in the world, is 8'3'' tall and once saved a dolphin's life by using his unusually long arms to extract small pieces of plastic from its stomach.

At the same time, strongman is regarded by many to be the most welcoming, friendly, and open-minded of all strength sports, and virtually every strongman you meet will be a gentle giant (and often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a>) of the highest order, to the point they <em>cheer their competitors on</em>!
<ul><li> Geoff Capes, 6'5½", was twice World's Strongest Man champion and Highland Games champion five years running. He's also so gentle that he is also a world champion at breeding budgerigars.
</li><li> Eddie Hall, the first human in history to deadlift half a tonne, won the 2018 World's Strongest Man contest at a canter. His reaction?

</li><li> Broadway actor Okieriete 'Oak' Onaodowan fits this trope.

Though he remains just as <em>loud</em> as ever off-screen, he is nonetheless warm and charming to everyone he meets. It's been said that his default setting is to treat everyone as if they have been his best friend for years.

Along with the Maine Coon, this breed of cat is regarded as a Gentle Giant because it can grow three times the size of other cats, yet are one the most docile, mellowest cats among any breed. There are rumours that they even lack the instinct to fight back due to their overwhelming gentle and innocent nature.
</li><li> When it comes to domestic rabbits, the larger breeds (some being fifteen pounds or more) tend to be the calmest and most easygoing.
</li><li> Jersey Giant chickens are the world's biggest breed of chicken and are known for their calm natures. The roosters even rarely get aggressive.
</li><li> Many large dog breeds, like St. Bernards, Newfoundlands, Old English sheepdogs, Great Danes, etc., are quite playful and friendly — in fact, much training involves teaching them that no matter how happy they are to see you, they still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFriendlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFriendlyDog">shouldn't knock you over</a>. There is a reason for this: most people would not breed from a dog with the body of a Great Dane and the brain of a Terrier. In general most kinds of dogs bred for water rescue are huge but very kind and gentle.
<ul><li> Greyhounds in particular are very large dogs, but are generally very gentle and docile. They're also quite lazy (especially retired race dogs, as is their right), make ideal apartment dogs despite their size, and are often called 45 mph couch potatoes.
</li><li> Pit bulls especially, despite their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">bad reputation</a>. Large and beefy and tough they may be, but if raised with the love and care one should treat any dog with, they are sweet, loving, dependable, and the worst thing they will ever do to you is bruise your leg from wagging their tails too enthusiastically when you're within whap-range. (Protip: raise them with love, and also <strong>train them well</strong>.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Wolves are actually far less dangerous than portrayed in media. They are very shy and elusive and prefer to keep away from humans. If you encounter one it is much more likely to walk away than try to eat you. When wolves are not hunting or defending their territory, they spend most of their time playing with each other and with the pups. Wolves handle their pups with great care and gentleness. There have been cases of wolves bonding with humans or other animals, and the big guys with their huge and extremely powerful bone-crushing jaws, are absolute sweethearts who are playful and loving.
</li><li> The Hickory Horned Devil caterpillar, the largest caterpillar in North America and larval form of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citheronia_regalis">regal or royal walnut moth<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, is five inches (13 cm) long, covered in menacing-looking spines from head to end, and yet it's completely and totally harmless. Also doubles as an inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">Killer Rabbit</a>.
</li><li> The whale shark. Not only the biggest shark, but the biggest fish alive today, period, at forty feet long. Gentle towards human divers — indeed, one of the most docile and gentlest marine animals any diver would have the fortune to encounter, and friend to all living things except its natural prey — plankton. The basking shark, the second largest living fish, is also very friendly and peaceful despite its gaping mouth, which it only uses to suck up plankton. The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVAbJoINVPo">megamouth shark<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> qualifies as well. You see, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreateningShark">not everything is worse with sharks</a>.
</li><li> Manta rays. Huge, harmless, and beautiful to watch.
</li><li> A smaller example is the Mola Mola, aka Ocean Sunfish, aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">"baby wheel"</a>. These odd-looking creatures grow to about the size of a car, but subsist entirely on jellyfish and crustaceans, and are very curious and gentle, often examining divers and even letting them touch them.
</li><li> Manatees and dugongs, big, harmless, plant eating sea mammals that have no natural enemies
</li><li> Gorillas. And more specifically, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.lelion.co.uk/index.html">Jambo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_(gorilla)">Koko<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Still not wise to approach them in the wild, though — but if you do so by accident, their first response will be a threat display from some distance (most often a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalChestPound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimalChestPound">Primal Chest-Pound</a> or a fake charge), and if you back off at that point, they're quite happy to let you leave.(Important note: never make eye contact. They interpret that as a challenge.)
<ul><li> Scientists observed that troops of gorilla prefer to solve things diplomatically rather than use violence.
</li><li> Orangutans as well, particularly adult male ones, who can grow to be up to 200 pounds with massive flanges at their side. Rarely aggressive, among the most intelligent animals on the planet, and spend most of their time scrounging around the forest eating fruits. Don't push them too far, however. Especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">mothers.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Galapagos tortoises. They can weigh over 900 pounds and live up to 170 years, but they wouldn't hurt a fly.
</li><li> Rhinoceros beetles. They're the largest of beetles, often have big, intimidating looking horns, and some species <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">can lift 850 times their own weight</a>, but they're docile and completely harmless to humans and only eat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">nectar, sap, fruit, and other sugary foods</a>. Even in territorial fights among rhino beetles, their tremendous strength and imposing horns are only used to flip the opponent on its back. They're actually popular pets in Japan.
<ul><li> African goliath beetles are among the heaviest insects in the world and as long as 3 inches, but are a lot like rhino beetles in temperament. Children in Africa will keep them as pets.
</li><li> We can also say all the same about stag beetles. However, the females can give pretty painful bites despite having smaller jaws, so handle with care.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with Asian elephants (usually), but averted (at least most of the time) with African elephants. Though there have in fact been several documented cases of African elephants becoming quite close and docile to the researchers who care for them, with most aggression only coming from males on hormonal musth rampage.
<ul><li> It really depends on the elephant and whether or not humans have hurt it. There's a story about one who was tasked with lowering logs into pre-dug holes and did as expected with most of them, but refused with one hole. A dog was sleeping in the hole. The elephant would only lower its burden when the dog had left.
</li></ul></li><li> Giraffes are known to be passive and very social animals, although they do fight with their necks.
</li><li> Crane flies. Several species can grow to large sizes, between 1.5 and 3 inches (3.8 and 7.5 cm) due to the large diameter of their legs, and they look like gigantic mosquitoes. But the worst a crane fly can do to someone is when their larvae do some damage to your lawn.
</li><li> Blue whales, the largest living creature on Earth. Very docile filter feeders, but with a bit of a reputation for shyness, and they can and will become defensive if in trouble. It's interesting to note they have virtually no natural enemies because of their sheer size.
<ul><li> On a slightly smaller scale, right whales are very friendly and curious about humans, and in fact this willingness to approach boats is part of what made them the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamePun">"right"</a> whale to hunt, which in turn contributed to their endangered status today.
</li><li> Whales in general are often perceived as such. This image was promoted by the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsOfTheHumpbackWhale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsOfTheHumpbackWhale">Songs of the Humpback Whale</a></em>, which was the first album with nothing but sounds of singing whales. At the time humans had always thought whales were mute, but this record proved otherwise and was instrumental in showing people that these creatures' singing abilities were a hidden talent.
</li></ul></li><li> Tapirs. They're very docile and shy, although they can bite when provoked.
</li><li> White rhinos. They are the largest species of rhinoceros, but are known for being docile. Still not a good idea to go near one, however, if you want to avoid a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhinoRampage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhinoRampage">Rhino Rampage</a>.
<ul><li> Averted with black rhinos, which are known to be more aggressive and prone to charging.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSquid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSquid">Giant Squid</a>. Contrary to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster">what the media might tell you</a>, giant squids have no interest in eating humans. The few times humans have interacted with these creatures, they either didn't notice the humans or didn't care that they were present at all. The few reliable accounts of aggressive behavior from giant squids can likely be attributed to startled and likely sick animals defending themselves.
</li><li> While little behavioral data on them exists, the few observed encounters and known ecological data suggests that colossal squid are also this; as large, slow-moving cold-water ambush predators, they have extremely slow metabolisms and mostly prey on Antarctic toothfish, making aggressive and predatory behavior towards humans logically unlikely under most circumstances. Like the giant squid, any credible accounts of aggressive behavior can likely be chalked up to vulnerable surfaced specimens acting in self-defense.
</li><li> It's often theorized that the biggest plant-eating dinosaurs may have been this. A justified trope in the case of sauropods, many of whom were so incredibly huge that they had absolutely no natural enemies whatsoever, meaning that they had no need to be particularly aggressive. Averted with ceratopsians, though, which are usually depicted as being extremely aggressive. Also averted with stegosaurs and ankylosaurs, both also considered to have been highly dangerous.
</li><li> Averted with moose. They actually cause more animal-related deaths in the United States than bears, despite looking big and goofy. Then again, most of those deaths are from people crashing cars into them, but mature individuals (particularly bulls) are unpredictable and can be wildly aggressive when startled, and most people in moose country will give them a wide berth if they spot them while on foot.
</li><li> Also averted with the common hippopotamus. They are known to kill over 2900 people a year in Africa and aren't afraid to attack any boats that enter their territory or even with no provocation at all.
<ul><li> Pygmy hippos aren't as ferocious, even said to behave similar to tapirs, but can still turn aggressive and will bite if they feel threatened. Despite this, they are often inquisitive and laid-back animals.
</li></ul></li><li> For a relative value of "giant," <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dcjanelle">Murkin the dog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is one toward a seemingly-endless stream of foster kittens.
</li><li> The liger (offspring of a male lion and a tigress) Hercules weighs nearly half a ton (~), six feet tall, and eleven feet long. To put things in perspective, his parents weight ~ <em>combined</em>. Hercules is also powerfully built and almost as fast as a cheetah. Fortunately, he's also a tame and relatively gentle big cat.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCockroach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCockroach">Giant Cave Cockroach</a> may qualify as one, despite being the second largest cockroaches, compared to the rest of the species, they are docile and do no harm to household environments, and they are actually beneficial to the ecosystem, as they primarily feed on decayed woods and plants.
</li><li> European hornets are big and scary-looking and are known to eat their smaller wasp cousins, but actually prefer to avoid conflict. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Just don't piss them off unless you want to be dealt a sting that REALLY hurts like hell.</a> The larger Asian giant hornet, on the other hand, is generally an aversion.
<ul><li> Unlike their terrible power in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>, Tarantula Hawk wasps are two inch long docile nectar-sippers<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7ifql');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7ifql" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7ifql');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They hunt tarantulas for their baby to feed on. It avoids eating anything important first to make sure its meal lasts.</span> and only the female stings when threatened. They only need to sting once because it will hurt and it hurts <strong>bad</strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> Many species of tarantula are known for their docile and gentle personalities (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">at least towards larger animals</a>), which make them popular as exotic pets.
</li><li> Pot bellied pigs can grow quite big, but are very friendly, laid-back and intelligent, providing they are raised well.
</li><li> Compared to the smaller honeybees, bumblebees are docile and prefer to ignore other animals unless provoked (which takes a lot to do). This is spite of the fact they are able to sting repeatedly without injuring themselves due to their stingers lacking barbs.
</li><li> Giant stick insects can reach nearly two feet in length, making them among the biggest insects in the world. Fortunately, they are completely harmless, feeding only on vegetation.
</li><li> Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world, but are very docile that they allow smaller animals to sit on them.
</li><li> The emperor scorpion is one of the largest scorpions alive today, but also one of the friendliest and least venomous, since it relies on using its pincers for killing prey rather than its sting. Not all scorpions are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryScorpions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryScorpions">scary</a>.
</li><li> Bears, despite being the largest land predators in existence, tend to prefer fish, berries, insects, and honey over large prey, but will something down when possible. They are generally shy around humans will avoid contact with them, unless hungry enough to scavenge for food in the garbage cans or one's camp, thus making their attacks rare (vs one's own dog, according to Stephen Herrero. However, startle one or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">come between a mother and her cubs, and you are in serious trouble.</a>
<ul><li> Often subverted with sloth bears in India, Siberian brown bears, and grizzly bears of North America, who are considered aggressive (though even grizzly bears generally avoid humans unless they perceive them as a threat or are desperately hungry).
</li><li> And <strong>very, very averted</strong> when it comes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">polar bears</a>, who are the only bears who are obligate carnivores and will eagerly and unhesitatingly add people to its usual menu of seals and marine mammals.
</li></ul></li><li> The largest and strongest land animals are mostly herbivores (elephant, giraffe, gorilla, rhinoceres, etc.). Doesn't mean that some like the hippo still can't be dangerous.
</li><li> Massively averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullSeeingRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullSeeingRed">bulls' case</a> as they're very aggressive and dangerous especially when they get territorial but played straight with the oxen: since they're castrated bulls, they're generally more calm and meek than their intact counterparts.
</li><li> Burmese pythons are massive (up to 18 or so feet long) nonvenomous snakes, but are largely docile around humans and are often kept as pets. Their friendliness, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">does ''not'' extend to other animals</a> like cats, small dogs, or even other reptiles, and released Burmese pythons often become invasive apex predators wherever they live.
