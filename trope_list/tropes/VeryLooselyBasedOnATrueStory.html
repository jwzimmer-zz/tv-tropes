<p>The truth is a funny thing. It's slippery, it's not always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanRevolution">self-evident</a>, it can seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">implausible</a>, it can even be inconvenient, and more often than not it's just plain boring. Very Loosely Based On A True Story occurs when a writer decides that reality just doesn't pack enough punch in some way, and decides to improve on the historical record. Arguably, this has actually <em>saved</em> some, er...true stories. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePatriot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePatriot">The Patriot</a></em> would have been two and a half hours of a group of Minute Men hiding for hours in swamps sniping English troops and then running away had they kept it true to the historical events of the time. Doesn't exactly sound riveting, does it?
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">This isn't always a bad thing</a>; after all, having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">Von Trapps</a> climb a mountain to freedom was much more uplifting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> audiences than sticking them on a train to Italy would have been. The problem comes when writers go too far and take all semblance of reality out of a character they <em>claim</em> to have based on a real individual. It can leave knowledgeable members of the audience wondering if the writers only claimed to have based the story on a real event to attract fans, and it can leave less knowledgeable members thinking they know more than they really do about the past.
</p><p>Very Loosely Based On A True Story often occurs because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, especially if some of the characters are based on living persons who might sue them if the depiction is too unsympathetic. Another motive is making characters less three-dimensional so as not to confuse viewers: producers may think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> who simply won't accept, say, a socialist/atheist/gay/etc. hero, or a villain who loves his spouse or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">pets his dog</a>. In other cases, the facts of real historical incidents will be changed because they don't fit into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHistory">Hollywood History</a> or because the truth would be inconvenient, as when cowboys in old Westerns were all played by white actors when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">many real cowboys were black, Hispanic, or American Indian</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is a common enough phenomenon in books and movies based on supposed paranormal events that this prologue was originally only about movies based on paranormal stories. Paranormals often have to be exaggerated because the original narratives (especially supposed "eyewitness" accounts) tend not to be very plausible or exciting, especially to anyone with a grain of common sense. So filmmakers and writers edit the story to make it seem more dramatic, authentic, or in tune with society's (or the writers') beliefs about religion, the supernatural, and UFOs. They may even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie">claim it really happened</a> if they think that'll scare the viewers more.
</p><p>There are two parts to this, stories with the actual names of the individuals involved and stories where everything except the general story is fictionalized (with considerable overlap).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This entire point can be lost on viewers. In particular, it is common for viewers outside of the United States to accept without question any depiction of the events in the United States in the popular entertainment media. This is why, for example, so many viewers outside of the United States praised <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberTheTitans">Remember the Titans</a></em> as unflinchingly accurate, when it was anything but.
</p><p>If a film or book says it's <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspiredBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspiredBy">Inspired by...</a></strong>, it's a sign that it'll be nowhere near the actual true story. If the resulting product is based on more than one real-life story, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatchedTogetherFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatchedTogetherFromTheHeadlines">Patched Together from the Headlines</a>.
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkepticismFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkepticismFailure">Skepticism Failure</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DocumentaryOfLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DocumentaryOfLies">Documentary of Lies</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspiredBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspiredBy">Inspired by...</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuggestedBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuggestedBy">Suggested by...</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">Beethoven Was an Alien Spy</a>. Anything based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a> overlaps with this trope pretty heavily. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanAClef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanAClef">Roman à Clef</a>, which is <em>tightly</em> based on a true story, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic">Biopic</a>.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie">Based on a Great Big Lie</a>. While it's sometimes hard to tell the difference, and there is usually overlap, this trope indicates that the central event/s actually happened but have been dressed up with fictional elements for the sake of telling a better story, whereas in the other trope the "central events" are fictional too.

<ul><li> Takashi Yanase's two most well-known stories are this. On one end, there is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Anpanman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Anpanman">Anpanman</a></em> which he created when Japan was starving after WWII. And then there is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RingingBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RingingBell">Ringing Bell</a></em> which is about his experiences as a soldier in China during WWII. Interestingly, the first is oddly happy and crazy, given the inspiration. <em>Ringing Bell</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SugarApocalypse">on the other hand...</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InnocentsShounenJuujigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InnocentsShounenJuujigun">Innocents Shounen Juujigun</a></em>, while Furuya very much took the story in his own direction, Etienne, the shepherd boy who claimed to be God's chosen child, actually existed. According to author's notes at the end of the manga, though, most of what's known about said story was likely heavily exaggerated to begin with. The fantasy elements and historical inaccuracies are what really earn the "loosely".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWindRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheWindRises">The Wind Rises</a></em> takes quite a few liberties with the story of Jiro Horikoshi, mainly due to making him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">Composite Character</a> with mostly Tatsuo Hori (the film is dedicated to the two of them) but with some shades of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HayaoMiyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>s father thrown in. In addition, the film's entire romantic subplot, down to the character of Naoko herself, is <em>entirely</em> fictional, with no corresponding scenario in real life. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0cbbv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0cbbv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0cbbv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Hori wrote a novel based on his wife dying from TB not even a year after their marriage but its mostly just an inspiration for the generic plot of this movie. The part of his father is that he was an aeronautical engineer in the era and his mother did have TB. However Mrs. Miyazaki was eventually cured and lived to her early seventies </span> Jiro was married but his wife was a perfectly healthy woman with whom he had six children, she never had tuberculosis and didnt die young.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>'s creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KentaroMiura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KentaroMiura">Kentaro Miura</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2017-09-19/berserk-creator-reveals-he-based-band-of-the-hawk-on-high-school-friendship/.121503">admitted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to basing the Band of the Hawk off his high school years.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FromHell">From Hell</a></em> was based primarily on an earlier book entitled <em>Jack The Ripper: The Final Solution</em>, which was later largely discredited. Moore, in the book's lengthy annotations, freely admits he doesn't believe a word of it, but was never one to let facts get in the way of a good story. Despite this, the actual history portrayed in the book was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">vigorously researched</a>, more so than some scholarly works on the Ripper. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromHell">The movie</a>, however, plays fast and loose with both the conspiracy theory and the real history...and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">the source material</a> , but that's beside the point. <br/><br/>The book used, as part of its "evidence," the long-discredited <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheProtocolsOfTheEldersOfZion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheProtocolsOfTheEldersOfZion">The Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a></em>, though mercifully taking it as anti-Masonic (the "Zion" in their interpretation being allegorical rather than literal) instead of anti-Semitic. This would be a good trick, as the "Protocols" weren't written until a decade or two after the Ripper murders, in Russia, intended for the eyes of Czar Nicholas II only, and weren't heavily publicized worldwide until well after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. However, they were based (word-for-word in parts) on a French anti-Masonic tract. Hell, one of the cited sources is the <em>Illuminatus! Trilogy</em>. It's pretty obvious Moore wasn't being entirely serious about accuracy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianKVaughan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianKVaughan">Brian K. Vaughan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PrideOfBaghdad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PrideOfBaghdad">Pride of Baghdad</a></em> is based on the true story of four lions who escaped the Baghdad zoo during the American bombing of 2003. The artist, Niko Henrichon, took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">Artistic License</a> to make a backstory for the lions in the newspaper article.
</li><li> In one of the more <em>VERY</em> loosely based, Bryan Lee O'Malley has claimed that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim">Scott Pilgrim</a></em> actually <em>is</em> based on a true story. The "true story" in this case being that he is Canadian and he met his American girlfriend (now ex-wife) Hope Larson while she was living in Canada.

In real life, Balto only ran the last leg of the race (and it wasn't even particularly long compared to what some of the other teams had to endure). For that matter, the real Balto was a purebred Siberian Husky, whereas his animated counterpart is a Wolf-Dog.

The fact that the RMS Titanic incident is even referred to as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">legend</a> is the least of these two films' problems. The first film actually has the audacity to have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLives">everyone survive the shipwreck</a></em>, resulting in a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">negative instance</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a>. And that's not even going into the subplots involving whaling, evil sharks teaming up with a whale-hunter to plan the shipwreck of the Titanic, talking dolphins, and a baby-faced octopus. (The last of whom being duped by the villains into placing the iceberg in the Titanic's way in the first place.) The second film drops any sense of relation to the actual incident left and brings Atlantis into the mess.

It case it wasn't obvious already, this isn't exactly how things played out in real life.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em> deserves special mention here: the movie is the first Disney animated story that is claimed to be "based on a true story", and by that of course, that Colonial Virginia had talking trees, magical Native Americans, numerous cliffs and nature scenes that are nowhere to be found in coastal Virginia and to beat a language barrier, one only needs to "listen with their heart". The creators made a point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">doing the research</a> — to the point of including detailed cultural advice from Russell Means (Lakhota) and Irene Bedard (Inupiat) — and then ignoring it in order to make the story seem more of a <em>legend</em>, so to speak. (And that's not even touching on other inaccuracies, such as the ages of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a> and John Smith, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie">whether the whole "save Smith from execution" story was actually true or not</a>.) Russ Means did say some of the magical elements are consistent with Native spiritual beliefs. Also notable is that the film ends on a bittersweet but ultimately hopeful note, suggesting that the heroes' actions will ensure that the native people and the Europeans will live in harmony. The less we say about what happened in real life the better.

However, none of the other owners reported anything out of the ordinary (and the ones who did happened to be desperate to get out of their mortgage).

Aside from how that theory has little to no actual proof behind it, the movie has no grasp of chronology, presents Queen Elizabeth as having multiple bastard children (she's known as the "Virgin Queen" for a reason), and generally presents everyone involved in such a way that if they had any living descendants, it would be grounds for a defamation suit.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind">A Beautiful Mind</a></em> completely misrepresents the work, career, family life, delusions, bizarre behavior, and cure of John Nash. Everybody in the movie is more sympathetic than the equivalent person in real life (the real John Nash's wife divorced him), but some critics think that the truth (that Nash recovered from schizophrenia without treatment) is too important to replace with an anodyne about loving families and putting your trust in psychiatrists. Liberties taken with Nash's story range from the egregious (not mentioning Nash's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals">homosexual relationships</a>) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">Artistic License</a> (Nash's hallucinations were strictly auditory, but that presents obvious problems for filmmaking) to avoiding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a> (Nash's delusions of a Communist conspiracy were about Jews in real life).

The movie is set in the present day and makes the closet Jew into a skinhead. The portrayal of this character and his psychological profile is largely fictional, but it was inspired by anecdotes about the real person, who seemed to oddly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">embrace parts of his Jewish heritage even as he scorned it</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigSick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigSick">The Big Sick</a></em> is based on the real life courtship of its scriptwriters, Emily V. Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani, with one major exception: Emily's parents play a major role in the plot, but in reality Kumail didn't even meet her parents until after the events depicted in the film — the film version's parents are so different from their real counterparts as to be fictional characters.

The film's C.W.

Jones and Henry Methvin, and omits many other gang members. Clyde is portrayed in the film as impotent, though there's no basis for this in reality. A nasty car accident that left Bonnie with a permanently lame leg is not in the film, nor are the frequent visits they made to their families. Clyde's motivation for the gang's crime spree is portrayed as anger at the banks for their role in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">The Great Depression</a>, but in reality it was over his abuses at the hands of both guards and inmates during his two-year imprisonment at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison">Eastham Prison Farm</a>, and the gang often targeted small stores and gas stations rather than banks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BootCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BootCamp">Boot Camp</a></em> is an amalgamation and fictionalization of stories from various "Tough Love" camps, without being a dramatization of any specific one of them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Braveheart">Braveheart</a></em> is only loosely based on the historical William Wallace and the events of his time. It's almost a sport among viewers to point out the many inaccuracies in the film, ranging from the idea that Wallace conceived Edward III seven years before he was born (when Queen Isabelle would have been 10 years old, and three years before she arrived in Britain) to the idea that Robert the Bruce instigated the Battle of Bannockburn immediately on hearing of Wallace's execution. The film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshades</a> is a bit, when the narrator admits in the beginning that "historians will call me a liar," but the opening narration is the most fictitious thing in the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBridgeOnTheRiverKwai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBridgeOnTheRiverKwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a></em> resembles actual history only insofar as the fact that a bridge was built over that river and it did get blown up. In real life, there were actually <em>two</em> bridges, and they were destroyed two years after their completion by an aerial bombing. This, of course, means the circumstances under which the bridge was blown up in the film are purely fictional. Director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLean">David Lean</a> was so unimpressed by the real River Kwai that he went to Ceylon to find a more suitably dramatic river.

The Sundance Kid was actually not known to have killed anyone prior to his final stand in Bolivia, though he is known to have wounded a few and certainly had a <em>reputation</em> as an excellent gunfighter.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1uulg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1uulg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1uulg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The real killer of the gang was a man called "Kid Curry", which may explain the mixup — they both had "Kid" in their names.</span> And the deaths of Butch and the Kid in the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian Army Ending</a> are historically foggy — all we know is that there was a shootout between the Bolivian army and two foreign bandits, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterToDieThanBeKilled">shot themselves</a> and were buried in unmarked graves before they could be identified.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ixsq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ixsq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ixsq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There is some evidence that Butch remained alive several years after that incident and lived a quiet life, but it's very much inconclusive.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cabaret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cabaret">Cabaret</a></em> is a film based on a musical based in part on part of a novel by Christopher Isherwood allegedly based on his encounters with one Sally Bowles. As a nice coincidence, Liza Minnelli <em>greatly</em> resembles the description of Sally in the novel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchMeIfYouCan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CatchMeIfYouCan">Catch Me If You Can</a></em> engages in this quite a bit. Besides throwing in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> for Frank becoming a con artist and counterfeiter, many details from Frank Abagnale Jr.'s life were altered or added in the film. For instance:
<ul><li> Frank's family life is totally different. He's depicted in the film as an only child, while he had three siblings in real life. He's also depicted in the film reaching out to his father between cons, whereas the real Frank never saw or spoke with his father again after leaving home. This drastically changes Frank's motivation in the film: his relationship with his father is so close that he can only stop his criminal lifestyle if his father wants him to, but his father (still embittered over the lack of support he received when his business went under) refuses and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">uses his son as a weapon to get back at the government</a>. In real life, Frank did what he did because he was good at it, and it was preferable to a real job or going to jail.
</li><li> Frank's quasi-friendship with Carl while he's on the run is entirely invented, although Frank and the agent who was chasing him did become friends after Frank was released from prison.
</li><li> Frank certainly didn't escape from the plane they way they show it in the film. For one thing, the septic tank on an airplane rarely detours into the luggage area. Frank does claim he did this in his memoir, but that in itself could have been an exaggeration (although he specifies the aircraft as a Vickers VC10, which is one of the few where the trick <em>might</em> work).
</li><li> Frank was not finally caught in France by any cunning FBI work. What actually happened was that after he had gone to ground in a small village, he was spotted by a Pan Am stewardess on vacation, who notified the police.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1936 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChargeOfTheLightBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChargeOfTheLightBrigade">The Charge of the Light Brigade</a></em>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErrolFlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ErrolFlynn">Errol Flynn</a>, depicts the eponymous charge during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CrimeanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CrimeanWar">Crimean War</a> as the protagonist's revenge on a treacherous Indian warlord. That the Crimean War involved Britain fighting Russia hundreds of miles from India is irrelevant. In fairness, the film includes a relatively accurate recreation of the Siege of Cawnpore, and the subsequent massacre of surrendered British troops and civilians... which occurred during the Indian Mutiny, three years after the Light Brigade's charge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chariot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chariot">Chariot</a></em> is simply inspired by the fact that a Boeing 727, sitting on the ground doing nothing in Angola, was stolen by a mechanic, took off, and disappeared without a trace in 2003.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chopper">Chopper</a></em> is based on Mark Brandon "Chopper" Read's memoirs, which are full of disputed or unverifiable claims. Some of it is true, such as Chopper earning his nickname by losing an ear in attack he staged on himself in order to be transferred to a safer prison wing. Other parts, possibly not so much:
<ul><li> Chopper denies driving Neville Bartos to the hospital after shooting him, saying "it defeats the purpose of having shot him in the first place!", but he is shown doing just that. The real life inspiration for Bartos later offered a third version: the shooting never happened.
</li><li> Chopper claimed to have killed 19 various underworld figures, which he downgraded long after the film came out to "four or seven, depending on how you look at it". He was only ever tried for one murder, of which he was acquitted when the jury accepted his claim of self-defense.
</li></ul></li><li> The Hungarian film <em>Colonel Redl</em> gives the eponymous figure an egregious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalHeroUpgrade">Historical Hero Upgrade</a>. The historical Alfred Redl was an Austrian spy in the early 1900s, and the Russians discovered his homosexuality and blackmailed him into leaking military secrets to them. In the film, though, Redl is an honest officer who discovers his superiors (up to and including Archduke Franz Ferdinand) plotting to start World War I — and when he tries to stop them, the Archduke frames him for treason.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolRunnings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CoolRunnings">Cool Runnings</a></em> is based on a true story about a team of bobsledders from Jamaica, in the sense that "in 1988 the Winter Olympics bobsledding event included a team from Jamaica." In real life, it wasn't quite as quirkly or dramatic. The idea came from two American businessmen, not the athletes themselves. The businessmen recruited the athletes from the military (so they weren't three sprinters and a competitive pushcart driver) and provided funding themselves (obviating the wacky fundraising antics the team resorted to in the film). The bobsledders' real names aren't even used in the film. The film portrays the other athletes in Calgary as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">jealous rivals</a>, whereas in real life, the other athletes were extremely supportive of them — in fact, the film version's biggest rivals, the East German team, provided the Jamaicans with equipment and coaching in real life. And despite being feted throughout the city, they had only middling success.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDamnedUnited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDamnedUnited">The Damned United</a></em> is a largely fictionalized account of Brian Clough's tenure as manager for Leeds United, first a novel by David Peace and then adapted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a> starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelSheen">Michael Sheen</a>.
</li><li> This seems to be the main reason why 2013's <em>Diana</em>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaomiWatts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaomiWatts">Naomi Watts</a>, performed so abysmally with critics and audiences. The film is based on Princess Diana's romantic relationship with Dr. Hasnat Khan shortly before her tragic death. The real Hasnat Khan has come out against the film, saying that its depiction of their relationship was based on sensationalistic tabloid accounts.
</li><li> The 2009 Canadian TV movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Diverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Diverted">Diverted</a></em> is comprised entirely of fictional characters, but the broad scenario it depicts is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/gander.asp">entirely real<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: when North American airspace closed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, thousands of passengers on transatlantic flights found themselves stranded in the small town of Gander, Newfoundland, whose inhabitants did everything humanly possible to provide for their needs and make them feel welcome.
</li><li> Lampshaded by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Domino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Domino">Domino</a></em>. The trailer states "Based on a True Story... Sort of."
</li><li> The movie adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieBrasco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieBrasco">Donnie Brasco</a></em> purports to be "the true story of FBI Agent Joseph Pistone's infiltration of the Mob", yet, to begin with, it invents events and characters, removes real ones, turns other FBI personnel into useless fools (one of the clownish characters in the movie was actually an FBI agent <em>posing as a dangerous mob turf boss</em> during the operation), and has Pistone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">engage in activities that would have sent him to prison in reality</a>. (No, a real-life agent may not legally conspire to commit a murder.) Lefty, the movie's faithful friend, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">was in fact a genuine thug</a>, often despised by Pistone, and many of the positive traits of his movie character were taken from the real-life Sonny Black — the only gangster with whom the real Pistone actually felt some kinship and considered to have a genuinely good side. He, in turn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">was of course turned</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> in the film... with his worst traits actually taken from Pistone's earliest mob mentor, a gangster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">whose personality was such</a> that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">feared and hated by other gangsters</a>. Unsurprisingly, his character is completely absent from the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonTheBruceLeeStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonTheBruceLeeStory">Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story</a></em>, starring Jason Scott Lee, claims to be the story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceLee">Bruce Lee</a>'s life, but it gets many things wrong, among them the timeline of his life, his "famous" match with Johnny Sun, his book's publication before his death, and the nature of his back injury. It also adds extra fights to the movie (such as one turning Shih Kien, who played Han in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnterTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnterTheDragon">Enter the Dragon</a></em>, into a covert Chinese assassin out to kill Lee), and invented an extra subplot involving a demon chasing Bruce Lee and his son in his nightmares.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightBelow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EightBelow">Eight Below</a></em> is about an American expedition in 1993 where almost all the dogs live. It was based on the true story of a Japanese expedition in 1958 in which almost all the dogs died.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheElephantMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheElephantMan">The Elephant Man</a></em>: A few details are accurate; Merrick's age as Treves meets him, his appearance (it had better be, given the prosthetics were made from a cast of the real Merrick), the existence of Nurse Nora Ireland, the building of the cardboard church (more or less), and Merrick's death. But the central plot of the story is almost entirely concocted. To give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidLynch">David Lynch</a> his due, he was going entirely off Treves's memoirs, and Treves himself had a very different impression of the showman who had exhibited Merrick than reality would represent (the most obvious departure from fact is that the "Elephant Man" was actually called Joseph — not John — Merrick).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elizabeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a></em> is a garbled mess of history, featuring people who were the wrong age (by as much as twenty years in some cases), people who should have been dead, and Elizabeth having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">lots of sex</a> despite being called the "Virgin Queen". Yes, she probably wasn't <em>actually</em> a virgin, but she did have to keep up appearances, and with all the maids and courtiers and others who surrounded her (and all the spies who would have loved to see some dirt on her), it would be very difficult to hide that level of promiscuity. A common rumor is that the director, who is Indian, was using Elizabeth as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">Lawyer-Friendly Cameo</a> for Indira Gandhi and her struggles to defuse religious tension, which might explain the... casual attitude to history.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmeraldForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmeraldForest">The Emerald Forest</a></em> was about a cute little white blonde American kid adopted and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByNatives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByNatives">Raised by Natives</a> in the jungles of Peru as his engineer dad searched for him. The "true story" is actually a mishmash of several different accounts, one of which is about a Peruvian child, the son of a construction worker. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceLift">whitewashing</a> was done avowedly to help the audience "relate" to a white father's anguished desperation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">as they couldn't have done if he'd been a brown-skinned construction worker played by a great Peruvian actor</a>.

The 2001 film takes it up a notch by cutting Alan Turing out of the film completely and assigning his role in the war to protagonist Tom Jericho, where in the book Jericho is a junior member of Turing's cryptanalysis staff.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Evilenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Evilenko">Evilenko</a></em> is an Italian horror movie that is <em>very</em> loosely based on the crimes of Andrei Chikatilo, a Russian serial killer. The movie portrays him as a hard-liner Soviet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>, enabling him to lure his victims to their deaths. It even goes so far as to suggest that American or European agencies wanted to whisk him away in order to study his hypnotic powers but were denied.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcismOfEmilyRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcismOfEmilyRose">The Exorcism of Emily Rose</a></em> is based on the story of Anneliese Michel, a young woman who was prone to seizures. Her very religious family and priests thought she was possessed and had her stop taking medication, instead relying on prayer and exorcism. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">She died</a>, not from seizures, but from malnutrition and dehydration from the ongoing exorcism — but she was convinced that it would be okay, because the Virgin Mary told her that her death would be an inspiration to others. The real story is rather sad, given that her death was preventable — even other priests were consulted and said she wasn't possessed by demons — but she walked right into it thanks to her religious upbringing. The film, on the other hand, wants to make it all about demonic possession, portraying doctors who are unable to explain her seizures and adding spooky cinematography and chilling music when depicting her attacks. The German film <em>Requiem</em>, based on the same story, is much more reserved.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FemaleAgents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FemaleAgents">Female Agents</a></em> was inspired by actual female operatives with the SOE, especially Lise Villameur (née De Baissac), on whom Louise is based.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FighterInTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FighterInTheWind">Fighter in the Wind</a></em> skips over sections of Mas Oyama's life and creates others out of whole cloth. General Kato is completely fictional, and "Choi Baedal" wasn't his given name (it was Choi Yeong-eui). There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">some dissent</a> over how much he was into Korean patriotism, as he joined the Japanese air force and took a Japanese name and citizenship voluntarily.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFinal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFinal">The Final</a></em> is very loosely based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">the Columbine Massacre</a>, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">Teens Are Monsters</a> aspect being the only thing really kept consistent. In the movie, a group of bullied kids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">mutilate and permanently scar the bullies who made fun of them</a> in high school. In reality, the two Columbine killers are reported to have been bullies themselves, who picked on the weaker kids before going on their shooting rampage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Also, whereas Columbine became a national tragedy and started discussions about bullying, the parents in the film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">dramatically miss the point</a> by portraying the attacks as completely unprovoked and the victims as saint-like, and the whole thing is forgotten so quickly as to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">"Shaggy Dog" Story</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindingNeverland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FindingNeverland">Finding Neverland</a></em> tells the story of how J. M. Barrie came to write <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> through his relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family, but kills off the husband, deletes one of the boys, and repeats the conventional wisdom that the story was really about the boy named Peter (not his brothers) — a bit of baggage that contributed to the real Peter's eventual suicide. Oh, and Johnny Depp went without Barrie's trademark mustache.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FireInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FireInTheSky">Fire in the Sky</a></em>: The real Travis Walton's story (if you choose to take his word for it) is nothing like what is shown in the film. The encounter aboard the UFO was spiced up to make it scarier, and quite frankly it had to be, because the story told by Walton was cheesy and absurd.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFourthKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFourthKind">The Fourth Kind</a></em> opens with a disclaimer by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MillaJovovich">Milla Jovovich</a> herself stating that the events in the film are based on a true story of Dr. Abigail Tyler, and claimed to use "real footage" of actual alien abduction case studies interwoven into the film footage. Similar to <em>White Noise</em>, it was <em>all</em> fabrication, as the "real" Abigail Tyler shown in the "real footage" is actually just another actress, and the "real footage" was just shot in a documentary style. There <em>have</em> been some real-life unsolved disappearances in Nome, but it's a big leap to conclude that aliens were responsible. The FBI suspects that several of these people merely got drunk, wandered off in harsh winter weather, and died of exposure.

<ul><li> Stanford White, after his death, was reported to have been responsible for drugging or incapacitating several young women and seducing them, whereas in the film he seems reluctant to get himself too involved with Evelyn Nesbit. He is also fully aware of Harry Thaw's hatred of him and even appears to encourage it, while it's generally agreed that in reality he had little to no idea of it.
</li><li> Harry Thaw, while still explicitly being an abusive husband and mentally unstable, was a violent sadist with a plethora of mental instabilities who also led a far more hedonistic lifestyle which, in fairness, probably wasn't permitted to be portrayed in film at that time.
</li><li> Evelyn Nesbit is portrayed as practically throwing herself at White and being convinced to lie about White getting her drunk (when she was just 16, mind you) and sleeping with her at Thaw's family's urging during the trial.

<ul><li> <em>The Girl Next Door</em> changes the names of Sylvia and her sister Jenny and has the abuse being carried out by their aunt, when real-life murderer Gertrude Baniszewski was merely a family friend from church.
</li><li> On the opposite end of the spectrum, <em>An American Crime</em> has a scene where Sylvia escapes and tries to get help for herself and her sister, only for it to have been an elaborate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream">Dying Dream</a>.

Everything else is completely fabricated. The real Adrian Cronauer had no problem with the war, being in an all-volunteer branch and describing himself as a "lifelong card-carrying Republican" who went on to be a lawyer who worked on the Republican presidential campaigns of Bob Dole (1996) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W.

The film's Adrian Cronauer is as irreverent as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinWilliams">the actor who plays him</a>, questions the war, fraternizes (unwittingly) with the Viet Cong, and shows a gross disrespect for his superiors.

Barnum, is all over the place. About the only thing it gets consistently right is that Barnum was a circus manager whose stable included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFreakshow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFreakshow">a cast of assorted "freaks"</a> and opera singer Jenny Lind, had a wife named Charity, had a rivalry with James Gordon Bennett, and had to rebuild his circus after it burned down. Much of the film, though, was exaggerated into typical Hollywood fare — the film portrays Barnum and Charity as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriendRomance">childhood sweethearts</a> (they weren't); condenses several familial figures, including his maternal grandfather Phineas Taylor, into his father's character (who dies earlier than he did in real life); and most damningly, portrays him as an utter failure of a businessman before opening the circus, when in real life the museum he opened <em>was</em> successful (although his variety troupe "Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater wasn't), and he only pivoted to the circus when he was 60 years old. Interestingly, the film also ignores some of the more <a class="urllink" href="https://lostmuseum.cuny.edu/archive/exhibit/heth">controversial details<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of Barnum's life and tones down <a class="urllink" href="https://lostmuseum.cuny.edu/archive/exhibit/what/">what he did to embellish the acts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and make them weirder than they really were.

However, the story was heavily dramatized, most notably in terms of how difficult it was for Milan to win the title — Hickory is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdogsNeverLose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderdogsNeverLose">an underdog throughout</a>, while Milan had made the semifinals the previous year and were considered a real contender. All of Hickory's wins in the film were decided by a single possession or in overtime, whereas Milan's run had only two victories by less than double figures. One of those wins was the final, which went much closer to how it went in the film — particularly the last two minutes, including Hickory's stalling while behind — but the similarities between the two games end there, even in their final scores. The film also portrays Hickory as having only a six-man roster, whereas Milan had ten players<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5pcni');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5pcni" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5pcni');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fun fact: of the 73 boys at Milan High that year, 58 tried out for the team</span>.

While many of the heroics of the sailors aboard are accurately chronicled, both the US Navy and Britanov himself deny that such a collision ever occurred. In reality, seawater seeping in through a pre-existing leak in one of the missile tubes led to an explosion and fire which disabled critical systems on board; a similar though less severe accident had previously led to one of the sub's missile tubes being unloaded and permanently sealed.

The rest, particularly his involvement in dozens (if not hundreds) of famous mob hits, is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nysun.com/new-york/meet-the-forrest-gump-of-mob-hits/35539/">succinctly summarized here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

The film has the <em>Essex</em> crew meet the crew of another whaler, who reveal that their ship too was sunk by the "white whale". After the <em>Essex</em> is sunk, the whale is shown stalking and further harassing the crew in the open boats. In reality, there is no evidence that the whale was ever seen before or after sinking the <em>Essex</em>. The film also invents a drama between Captain George Pollard and First Mate Owen Chase where none existed before. Furthermore, the premise is shown to be based around Herman Melville interviewing the elderly Thomas Nickerson, but the two never met in real life; Melville's primary source was Chase's own book about the incident.

Ip Man was never a laborer in any Marxist-Leninist-Maoist sense. He worked as a police officer for most of his adult life. He was never affiliated with the Communist Party in any way — at the time of the films, he was a card-carrying member of Kuomintang, the Chinese Nationalist Party and the sworn enemies of the Communists. And his flight to Hong Kong was not to escape the Japanese, but the Communists.

Everything that happens <em>after</em> this in the movie is complete fiction. The movie depicts the two as falling in love afterward, and the antagonist is the officer's greedy wife, who divorces him and tries to get both her husband and the waitress's share of the money. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,303110,00.html">In reality<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, there was never anything between the officer and waitress beyond friendship, both remained happily married to other people after the incident, and the officer's wife had no problem with splitting the money. That said, the writers didn't use the real names of anyone involved, and a disclaimer at the end of the film states what really happened.

</li><li> Oliver Stone's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK">JFK</a></em> presents itself as revealing the truth about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK">Who Shot JFK?</a>, arguing in particular that it had to have been a conspiracy. In fact, it's based on the writings of the real Jim Garrison, whom even JFK conspiracy theorists aren't likely to trust. The film is unfortunately the source of so much lore about the assassination that things on which it speculated (<em>e.g.</em> the magic bullet) or even invented (<em>e.g.</em> the smoke from the grassy knoll) are commonly believed to be true by the public. A lot of that lore, like many impactful movies, just seems <a class="urllink" href="http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/jfkmovie.htm">more compelling than the truth<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Stone would later express regret at not making it clearer that the film wasn't meant to be entirely truthful, but more a metaphor for the American public's frustration at not knowing how the assassination really happened.

But the idea that she directly participated in the fighting, or commanded a women's brigade, is generally considered to be a folk myth. What makes this especially blatant is how the movie boldly announces it is going to tell what "everyone knows" to be the <em>real</em> story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKillerThatStalkedNewYork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKillerThatStalkedNewYork">The Killer That Stalked New York</a></em> is a 1950 film very loosely based on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_New_York_City_smallpox_outbreak">1947 New York City smallpox outbreak<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. There really was an outbreak of smallpox in New York City in 1947, but the specifics are radically altered for the movie. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, the index case was not a smuggler but a regular tourist, did not get infected in Cuba but in Mexico, and was not the subject of a contact-tracing manhunt but was rather admitted to hospital before the outbreak really began.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingdomOfHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingdomOfHeaven">Kingdom of Heaven</a></em> edges into this at points. The greater historical events surrounding the Battle of Hattin (the film's climax) are held relatively true to history, but many of the film's main characters bear little resemblance to their historical counterparts:
<ul><li> This is most evident with Balian, the film's main protagonist, whose personal history is radically different from that of the real Balian of Ibelin. The real Balian was married with children, not to mention born in wedlock and decidedly <em>not</em> a blacksmith.
</li><li> Godfrey of Ibelin did not exist. The real Balian's father was named Barisan. (This change is likely because Godfrey does not appear to be modeled on Barisan or any historical figure; rather, the character exists solely as a part of Balian's fictionalized backstory.)
</li><li> Princess Sibylla was close with her husband, Guy, and wholeheartedly supported his strategy. In fact, she actively subverted an attempt by the court to block Guy from ascending to the throne. She had no relationship with Balian at all.
</li><li> In the film, King Baldwin IV, though disfigured by leprosy, is pretty much functional until after the incident at Kerak, at which point he falls into a rapid decline and dies shortly thereafter. In reality, the progression of his condition was much more drawn out, leaving him an invalid long before his death; he would not have been able to lead an army into battle for the last several <em>years</em> of his life, let alone just days before he died.
</li><li> The real Guy de Lusignan was not especially eager to go to war, and he certainly wasn't pulling Reynald's strings to make it happen. In fact, history suggests that it was Reynald who was the driving force behind the conflict, and Guy was a weak-willed king who couldn't control him and thus was dragged along for the ride.
</li><li> The theatrical cut of the film depicts the throne as passing directly from Baldwin IV to Guy. In reality, the King's young nephew was his successor, and it was only after the child's premature death that the throne reverted back to Sibylla to choose the next King. Scenes depicting this part of the story were written and shot, but were cut from the theatrical release for time; this arc is included in the director's cut.
</li><li> The one major aversion is Reynald himself; other than his role in relation to Guy, Reynald in the film is very much similar to his historical counterpart. Apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Warhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Warhawk">the real Reynald</a> made for a good enough character that the writers largely left him as he was in real life. If anything, they actually toned down some of his more atrocious deeds.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1933" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1933">King Kong (1933)</a></em> was inspired by an actual expedition to Komodo Island led by W. Douglas Burden in 1926, to collect and study the isle's giant lizards. Note that we said "lizards", not "giant apes and dinosaurs".

However, even though a statement at the beginning of the film says it's a true story, the character Nicholas Garrigan never existed and is loosely based on Bob Astles. The film is also an adaptation of a <em>fiction</em> work with the same title.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ALeagueOfTheirOwn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ALeagueOfTheirOwn">A League of Their Own</a></em> never outright claims to be the true story of the All-American Girl's Professional Baseball League, which is a good thing, because the fact the league existed (and the names of a few of the teams) are all it really got right when you look at it historically. Several characters were compressed into Geena Davis's character Dottie Henson, and pretty much everybody else's names were changed. The biggest thing that the movie <em>did</em> get right was that during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, a league of women baseball players was formed, and some of those women played good enough ball to be in the big leagues.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">highly contentious</a> documentary <em>Leaving Neverland</em>, about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> and the accusations against him of child molestation, was attacked as an exaggeration within a week of its release. Some of it, obviously, was Jackson's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">rabid fanbase</a> refusing to believe the allegations on principle, but others pointed out that the documentary was deliberately slanted against Jackson — the director even admitted that he did not interview anyone who could rebut the accusations so as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">not to interfere with the story he wanted to tell</a>. Accuser Wade Robson in particular noted that he had in fact testified twice on Jackson's behalf, and the depiction of him burning Jackson memorabilia was fabricated — in real life, an auction house revealed that he had sold the memorabilia to them (and tried to do it anonymously).
</li><li> The advertising material for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LustForGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LustForGold">Lust for Gold</a></em> bills it as the true story of the Lost Dutchman Mine. However, it was based on a book titled <em>Thunder God's Gold</em> which synthesized several stories and legends regarding the mine into a whole. Jacob Walz and Julia Thomas were real people, but they didn't meet until after the events involving the mine, with Julia nursing Jacob in the last years of his life. She certainly did not die in an earthquake on Superstition Mountain. Floyd Buckley is based on real-life treasure hunter Adolf Ruth, who was murdered while searching for the mine the 1930s. However, that murder was not one of a string of killings as shown in the film.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMaids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMaids">The Maids</a></em>, murderous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a> sisters Claire and Solange are kind of based on Christine and Lea <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papin_sisters">Papin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who really were murderous lesbian maids, but resemblance ends here.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOnTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManOnTheMoon">Man on the Moon</a></em>, which opens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman">Andy Kaufman</a> complaining about how the film takes liberties with his life story, leading to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreditsGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreditsGag">Credits Gag</a>. The differences are many:
<ul><li> The legendary Carnegie Hall show, which in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> took place in 1979 at the peak of Kaufman's mainstream success, is moved to shortly before his death in 1984.
</li><li> The Tony Clifton incident happened during the first year, before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a> became a regular.
</li><li> Andy and Lynn did not actually meet in the wrestling ring.
</li><li> The "Global Wrestling Federation" banner is misplaced; the Lawler-Kaufman match was held by the Continental Wrestling Federation in Memphis in 1982, whereas the Global Wrestling Federation was a Dallas-based promotion that existed from 1991 to 1994. Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimRoss">Jim Ross</a> would have been misplaced as this match's announcer, as at the time he was working in Louisiana and Oklahoma for Mid-South Wrestling (but he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a> were the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> announcers when the film was produced, so there you have it).
</li><li> The film shows Kaufman's <em>Fridays</em> stunt as a real objection to doing drug-related humor, with Kaufman even insisting to the audience that it was <em>not</em> staged. But according to multiple sources from the show, it actually was (though who all was in on it is up for debate), plus the scene as shown differs significantly from the real sketch, which you can <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN5vhvIAqY8">see on YouTube<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> This film ignores Kaufman's short-lived but infamous big screen career. It pretends <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heartbeeps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heartbeeps">Heartbeeps</a></em>, among other films, never happened. Apparently he spent his entire 80's career being a wrestler and getting cancer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mental" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mental">Mental</a></em>: The director's mother had a mental breakdown and his politician father hired a smoking hitchhiker with a dog and her knife in her boot to babysit them, and who stayed with them for months. The rest was invented for the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoneyMovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MoneyMovers">Money Movers</a></em> deals loosely with two real-life events, the 1970 Sydney Armoured Car Robbery where A$500,000 was stolen from a Mayne Nickless armoured van, and a 1970 incident where A$280,000 was stolen from Metropolitan Security Services' offices by bandits impersonating policemen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMostAssassinatedWomanInTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMostAssassinatedWomanInTheWorld">The Most Assassinated Woman in the World</a></em> is very loosely based on the real life Scream Queen of the <em>Grand Guignol</em>, Paula Maxa. However, she did not fake her own death on-stage, and in fact moved on to film, and died in her 70s.
</li><li> The events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMothmanProphecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMothmanProphecies">The Mothman Prophecies</a></em> already leave plenty of room for skepticism. Perhaps sensing this, director Mark Pellington chose to make the entire plot fictional (even setting it in the present day). The only significant things consistent between the stories are the Mothman itself and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the climactic Silver Bridge collapse</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Munich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Munich">Munich</a></em>. Yes, Israel did launch Operation Wrath of God to hunt down the Munich terrorists. The veracity of most of the details in the film, however, is at best in dispute.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NachoLibre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NachoLibre">Nacho Libre</a></em> was loosely (very, <em>very</em> loosely) based on the life of Fray Tormenta, a real-life monk-turned-luchador who supported an orphanage by wrestling for 23 years. To his credit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBlack">Jack Black</a> never claimed that the movie was a true story, only that it was inspired by Tormenta.
</li><li> Despite being a Disney musical, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Newsies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Newsies">Newsies</a></em> is based on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsboys_Strike_of_1899">a real newsboys' strike<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; the newsies' nicknames are mostly taken from contemporary records, the conditions of their work are fairly accurately depicted, and several of the incidents in the film closely follow the real events, but otherwise it's pretty much fiction. The real Newsboys Strike was led by Kid Blink, who does appear in the film (with an eye patch!) even if he isn't leading the strike.
</li><li> The non-supernatural parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet1984">A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)</a></em> are inspired by events that happened in the hometown the director lived in as a kid. Specifically, Freddy is the name of the kid who tormented wee little Craven, Freddy's appearance was based on that of a old homeless man wee Craven had a terrifying run-in with one night, and the "died in their sleep" thing was based on a few cases of young Cambodian refugees dying in their sleep of no apparent cause after repeatedly saying they were frightened to go to sleep. That would be <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1647019/">Sudden Unexpected Death Syndrome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which for some reason is most common among South East Asians.
</li><li> In the Indie chiller <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OpenWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OpenWater">Open Water</a></em>, it's actually based on a true story, but the events of the film have been invented because no one can know what actually happened—and the actual couple were older.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PainAndGain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PainAndGain">Pain and Gain</a></em> is based on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/pain-gain/">a series of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/1999-12-30/news/pain-gain-part-2/">Miami New Times<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2000-01-06/news/pain-gain-part-3/">articles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. What's surprising is just how much stuff portrayed in the film actually did happen (Paul barbecuing the severed hands is accompanied by the onscreen graphic "this is still a true story").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PatchAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PatchAdams">Patch Adams</a></em>: Patch's romantic foil of a love interest Carin never really existed. He was actually a male best friend of Dr. Adams. Moreover, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">the real Dr. Adams felt that the film didn't accurately represent his views and philosophies</a> as it simplified all his work into "laughter is the best medicine". Not to mention the felonies (stealing supplies from a hospital and practicing medicine without a license) that the movie depicts which, needless to say, the real Dr. Adams never did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PathsOfGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PathsOfGlory">Paths of Glory</a></em> is loosely based on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souain_corporals_affair">Souain Corporals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>—an event in World War I where a general had several soldiers executed for cowardice when their company refused a suicidal order. All the characters involved are fictional, as is the location and battle, and even the number of soldiers executed—making the overall product more like historical fiction that bears a lot of resemblance to the real events.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RolandEmmerich">Roland Emmerich</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePatriot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePatriot">The Patriot</a></em> is basically a loose and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectHistory">PC version</a> of the real life of Francis Marion. If you ask, no, he didn't free his slaves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhenixCityStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhenixCityStory">The Phenix City Story</a></em> from 1955 is based on the assassination of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Patterson">Albert Patterson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">the previous year</a>. The events surrounding the assassination are heavily fictionalized, however. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> mob boss Rhett Tanner is fictional, for instance, and the scene where a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">murdered child</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay">dumped on the Pattersons' lawn as a threat</a> never happened. The details of the assassination and its aftermath are also changed: in the film Patterson is shot at arm's length whereas in real life he was shot through the mouth, in the film there is a single witness whom the mob successfully silences whereas in real life there were several witnesses who later testified in the trial, in the film the mob is responsible whereas in real life the Chief Deputy Sheriff was convicted of the murder, and so on.
</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/APlaceInTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/APlaceInTheSun">A Place in the Sun</a></em> is adapted from the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnAmericanTragedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnAmericanTragedy">An American Tragedy</a></em>, which is itself based on the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Grace_Brown">story of the 1906 murder of Grace Brown by her boyfriend Chester Gillette<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. While the movie takes liberties with the story—Brown was a lovely young woman but is portrayed as frumpy and nagging, the real-life murder was certain but left ambiguous in the film (possibly an accident), the plot follows the real-life events—Brown and Gillette were romantically involved and she was insisting that they marry due to her out-of-wedlock pregnancy, while he was reluctant because doing so would have ended his chances of advancing into wealthy society. After inviting her away for the weekend under the pretense of it being a wedding trip, he took her out onto a lake where he promptly struck her on the head and threw her into the water to drown. The movie has them <em>both</em> falling out of the boat, but the fade to black leaves the viewer wondering if he might very well have tried to save her and simply been unsuccessful. In both mediums, the man was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.
</li><li> The 2012 horror movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePossession">The Possession</a></em> claims to be based on a true story, specifically that of the <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051105000557/www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/rubyc/eBay_dibbuk.htm">"dibbuk box"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The similarities between the film and the dibbuk box are as follows: the dibbuk box exists, its owners experience a wave of bad luck that they claimed was linked to the box, and that's about it. None of the stories involve a girl getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possessed</a> by whatever was living in it.
</li><li> The movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primeval" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primeval">Primeval</a></em>, while it deals with an actual, real-life giant crocodile (Gustave), exaggerates every other aspect of the events it claims to recount, from doubling his number of human kills, to depicting him seeking out and attacking entire groups of clearly defended humans (the real Gustave strikes at groups of three or fewer tourists, primarily when they are off-guard, and certainly when they lack shelter). And that's without mentioning the film's ads, which portray him as "the most prolific serial killer in history". On top of all that, it's a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverTrustATrailer">Never Trust a Trailer</a> — Gustave only appears in brief stretches, and most of the film deals with a local civil war, with the croc relegated to the background for the most part.
</li><li> An unusual example in the WWII American propaganda film <em>The Purple Heart</em>, which is based on the fates of the eight pilots who took part in the "Doolittle Raid" in 1942. The eight were captured and put on trial by the Japanese - however, their true fates were not known until after the film was made. The film alters the names of the pilots and implies that they will all be executed (which no doubt seemed like the most likely outcome at the time); in reality, however, only three were executed and one more died in captivity while the other four were eventually released after the war.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDog">Red Dog</a></em> is based on a book by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisDeBernieres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LouisDeBernieres">Louis de Bernières</a>, which is in turn based a collection of anecdotes and poems of the same name. Red Dog was real, as is the town of Dampier, and Red Dog was known to travel vast distances along Western Australia's Pilbara region, spending much of the meantime in Dampier. It is also true that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> died in 1979</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> had a statue built in his honor</span>, but most of the rest of what happens in the film is almost certainly fictitious. The film further divorces the fictionalized Red Dog's adventures from anything that might have happened in real life by having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> invoke the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> trope on at least one occasion, although the bulk of it can be thought of as true in-universe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RememberTheTitans">Remember the Titans</a></em>: The film's entire premise is undermined if one is aware that in reality (1) T C Williams high school had been desegregated since 1959, and (2) the school was already a football powerhouse, having won the state championship (under Yoast) the previous season.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheLivingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheReturnOfTheLivingDead">The Return of the Living Dead</a></em>, with the disclaimer "All of the events in this film are true. Everything is shown as it actually happened".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rocketman2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Rocketman2019">Rocketman</a></em> played with this, even lampshading it in the tagline, "Based on a true fantasy".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomasantaTheWerewolfHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RomasantaTheWerewolfHunt">Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt</a></em> is based the story of Manuel Blanco Romasanta: generally regarded as Spain's first identified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a>. While portraying many of the events of the case, it elaborates greatly and plays up the mystical aspects, which were almost nonexistent in reality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchoolOfRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SchoolOfRock">School of Rock</a></em> was inspired by the story of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Langley_Schools_Music_Project">The Langley Schools Music Project<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> but was otherwise completely fictional.
</li><li> There is some actual proof that the Scorpion King was a real person. However, the guy played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">The Rock</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyReturns">The Mummy Returns</a></em> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Spin-Off</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing">The Scorpion King</a></em> seemed to be him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shadowlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shadowlands">Shadowlands</a></em>, the story of C. S. Lewis's marriage to Joy Davidman Gresham, ending with her death. True in broad outline, but the film deletes one of Joy's two real-life sons. On Lewis and Joy's vacation in Ireland, he drives a car, while in real life Lewis notoriously never learned to drive. The film omits a major experience they shared, a trip to Greece after Joy's cancer returned. As a minor point, Lewis's brother Warren is shown as present at Lewis's first meeting with Joy; he wasn't. Most importantly, Lewis was far from the ivory-tower bachelor professor, ignorant of both women and suffering, portrayed in the movie. His mother died of cancer when he was a boy, and he was wounded in World War I. Until shortly before he began corresponding with Joy, he and his brother shared a bustling household with the widowed Mrs. Jane Moore, whom Lewis considered his foster mother, and her daughter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSocialNetwork">The Social Network</a></em> made no qualms about being a heavily fictionalized telling of the Facebook story. Right down to the fact that Mark Zuckerberg is portrayed as a pompous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> in the movie, whereas the real life Zuckerberg is actually known to be a very shy and modest person. On the other hand, the real life story of Facebook's creation is actually pretty dull and uninteresting compared to how it's portrayed in the movie, making this a prime example of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSoundOfMusic">The Sound of Music</a></em>: While the basic outline of the story is true, <em>all</em> of the details (including the time lines, the songs, the names of the children and even the geographical relationship between Switzerland and Austria) were rearranged for the musical. You cannot get to Switzerland by climbing over the mountains from Salzburg.
<ul><li> Ironically, it's often claimed that Georg von Trapp's status as a retired captain of the Austrian Navy must be a falsehood because Austria is landlocked. But before 1918 Austria was much larger; Austrian lands included the shore of the Eastern Adriatic from Trieste (now in Italy) to Dubrovnik (now in Croatia). It had a small but effective and well-respected navy whose main task before World War I was to protect these ports. And to culminate that, the <em>real</em> Von Trapp earned a medal while serving on a ship off the coast of China, during the Boxer Rebellion of 1899-1900. His uniform jacket is preserved in the Military History museum in Vienna. Captain Von Trapp was born in a coastal town, Zadar, in what is now Croatia.
<ul><li> Related to the above, the real Captain von Trapp angsted a <em>lot</em> longer than his fictionalized counterpart over his decision to not accept a German commission. In 1938 the good captain was a submarine commander who had not set foot on a ship in two decades, and whose service branch no longer existed. The offer of command of a cutting-edge U-Boot was <em>sorely</em> tempting.
</li></ul></li><li> In real life, Von Trapp married Maria in 1926, rather than in 1938 as in the film, and they had two children before leaving Austria. In the film they marry in 1938 and have no time to have children before heading overseas.
</li><li> In the film, the family climb over a mountain to get into Switzerland. In real life, they simply got onto a train to Italy.
</li><li> In the film, Captain von Trapp is a strict disciplinarian who drills his children like Navy sailors with his whistle. In real life, the Captain was a highly permissive free-range parent, and Maria the disciplinarian. The whistle did exist in real life, but was used to communicate over the large distances of the estate, since the captain had a very weak voice.
</li><li> By far the biggest distortion of the film was the reaction of Austria to the Anschluss. The movie makes it seem like one or two high-ranked quislings brought it off against the wishes of the vast majority of the people. The truth is almost exactly the opposite. Austrian chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg did just about everything possible to avoid it; the incoming Nazis were greeted by cheering throngs of Austrian citizens; even allowing for irregularities, Austrians approved the takeover in an overwhelming plebiscite; and Herr Schuschnigg spent the next seven years in Nazi concentration camps.
</li></ul></li><li> The movie series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStepfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStepfather">The Stepfather</a></em> and <em>The Remix</em> was based on the true case of John List, though List was not a serial killer. <em>The Stepfather</em> does fit his case very well, it just goes the extra step of having him do this habitually instead of it being a one-time incident.
</li><li> The 2005 film <em>Stoned</em> is about the end of founding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">Rolling Stones</a> member <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BrianJones">Brian Jones</a>' life. After all, there is some debate as to whether his death was an accident or manslaughter/murder, which makes a decent premise for a movie. However, the Brian Jones of the movie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">is even more problematic than his real life counterpart</a> (not helped by the fact that the movie failed to showcase any of Brian's musical talents or more savory character traits), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards">Keith Richards</a> is portrayed as the moral center of the movie (to the point where Brian's girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg, insinuates that Keith is the more responsible of the two when it comes to substance abuse), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VictimBlaming">lays much of the blame for Brian's problems on Anita Pallenberg</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">despite this movie mostly showing him being abusive towards her, culminating in a truly uncomfortable scene in Morocco,</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7f3xo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7f3xo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7f3xo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> In real life, she and Brian were abusive to each other and she eventually left him for Keith Richards after two years during a trip to the Morocco, though the specifics are somewhat debated </span> and on top of all of that, there is a curious scene at the end in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs">Brian comes back to Earth as a ghost to thank Tom Keylock for making him a martyr despite the fact that the movie claims Frank Thorogood murdered Brian</a>. The movie received largely negative reviews from critics
</li><li> The horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStrangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStrangers">The Strangers</a></em> is a prime example of this trope: it opens by labeling the plot of the film as "based on true events" — supposedly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MansonFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MansonFamily">Manson Family</a> murders. Similarities are slight. Another thing in the movie with a basis in reality is a technique employed by burglars (burglars, not serial killers) in which they knock on a random door to ask for a person who doesn't live there. If no one is home, they break in and steal stuff.
<ul><li> Some have suggested the 1981 Keddie murders as the inspiration. A family of three and a friend of the family's were brutally murdered in a Northern California cabin. To this day, the killers and their motives remain a mystery.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sunset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sunset">Sunset</a></em>: While highly fictional, the film does actually contain a few elements of truth. Wyatt Earp did live in Hollywood in the 1920s, did act as a technical adviser on several silent westerns, and was close friends with Tom Mix (who served as a pallbearer at Earp's funeral). The murder in the movie is very loosely based on the events surrounding the death of Thomas Ince (which did not involve Earp or Mix in any way). The film's closing titles admit this in a reference to a repeated quote from the film itself that "that's the way it really happened, give or take a lie or two."
</li><li> The 2005 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Supervolcano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Supervolcano">Supervolcano</a></em> is based, interestingly enough, on a story that may very well happen someday, only no-one knows when. It deals with the possible consequences of the "overdue" eruption of the volcano underneath Yellowstone National Park. The tagline actually reads "This is a true story. It just hasn't happened yet."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Suspiria1977" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Suspiria1977">Suspiria (1977)</a></em>, believe it or not, was inspired by what co-writer Daria Nicolodi's grandmother claimed really happened; that she (the grandmother) as a young woman fled a music school because she found out they were practicing black magic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SweeneyToddTheDemonBarberOfFleetStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SweeneyToddTheDemonBarberOfFleetStreet">Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</a></em>: It's usually a well-known fact that the movie is based on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyToddTheDemonBarberOfFleetStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyToddTheDemonBarberOfFleetStreet">musical</a>, which added stories of revenge, a judge, and Sweeney's daughter to the original story. The latter was originally a novel, itself based on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a>...which have its roots in a true story. The latter is quite different from <em>Sweeney</em> 's scenario, though, except it involved cannibalism. It happened in Paris, not London, and as soon as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">1387</a>, in Marmousets street. Also, the baker was male, not female, and named Pierre Miquelon, while his barber neighbor was Barnabé Cabard. Their motivation was apparently simply greed, (no revenge story here) and they were burned at the stake after it was discovered they used students corpses to do pâtés. Ironically, Barnabé is nowadays often described as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">"french Sweeney Todd"</a>, while it's actually the other way round.
</li><li> The remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre2003">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></em> was heavily touted as being based on a true story. The film chronicles an inbred family of kidnappers, torturers, serial killers, and implied cannibals who brutally slay a carload of road tripping teens. The actual case it was based on, Ed Gein, was a solitary, fairly quiet man who killed only two middle-aged women, without a chainsaw, and in <em>Wisconsin</em>. While two murders are indeed tragic, that's still a lot less than the scores of murders implied in <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainSawMassacre1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainSawMassacre1974">The original movie</a> touted this claim as well. Of course, that doesn't keep it from being a cinema classic.
</li><li> It also has some relation to the legend of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawney_Bean">Sawney Bean<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which has been around for several hundred years but is probably fictional. The Sawney Bean family was the direct inspiration for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsHaveEyes1977" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsHaveEyes1977">The Hills Have Eyes (1977)</a></em>.
</li><li> Ed Gein has had several movies purporting to tell his story, as well as probably dozens that were "Inspired By" it; he was something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> for slasher and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> fiction. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Psycho">Psycho</a></em> is probably the most famous, and despite not claiming to be based on anything but a novel by the same title it's considered a fairly good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualAdaptation">spiritual biopic</a>.
</li><li> As far as <em>actual</em> biopics go, the version starring Steve Railsback released in 2000 actually does a decent job sticking to history. The version starring Kane Hodder, released in 2007, couldn't have been further off the facts of the case if the writer and/or director had been <em>trying</em> to avoid getting anything right. About all that was correct was Gein's name, the deaths of two family members before the events covered in the film, and the year and place of his crimes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTheoryOfEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTheoryOfEverything">The Theory of Everything</a></em> takes a few artistic liberties with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking">Stephen Hawking</a>'s life in the interest of better narrative flow. For example, in the film's sequence of events, he loses the ability to speak, decides to write <em>A Brief History of Time</em>, separates from Jane, and reconciles with her before going to Buckingham Palace to be made a CBE. In reality, he was made a CBE in 1982, started drafting <em>A Brief History of Time</em> in 1984, lost the ability to speak in 1985, and separated from Jane in 1990, only reconciling with her after his divorce from Elaine Mason in 2006.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyDiedWithTheirBootsOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheyDiedWithTheirBootsOn">They Died with Their Boots On</a></em> pretty much makes up everything besides the fact that George Armstrong Custer served in the Civil War, and was killed with all his men by Indians.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeBillboardsOutsideEbbingMissouri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeBillboardsOutsideEbbingMissouri">Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinMcDonagh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinMcDonagh">Martin McDonagh</a> was once driving down a highway in the American south and saw three sequential billboards with text describing the rape and murder of a woman and asking why the local authorities hadn't made any arrests yet. The rest of the movie is what he imagined would have led to those billboards being there and what would have happened next - In particular, in the film the billboards were rented by the victim's mother, but it later turned out the real billboards were rented by her father.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thunderheart">Thunderheart</a></em>: The film is based on actual incidents on and around the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota during the 1970s, which John Trudell (Jimmy Looks Twice) participated in personally (he was chairman of AIM). His character also bears a great resemblance to his friend Leonard Peltier, who was controversially convicted in the murders of two FBI agents (Peltier remains imprisoned, and a documentary about this came out in the same year, entitled <em>Incident at Oglala</em>). The Aboriginal Rights Movements clearly represents the American Indian Movement as well, which both Trudell and Peltier were prominent members of. Jack Milton (Fred Ward) is pretty clearly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a> of pro-government tribal council president Dick Wilson, whose followers are alleged to have murdered numerous dissidents. The Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs) appear much as they're reported to have behaved. The schoolteacher Maggie Eagle Bear is based on Anna Mae Pictou Aquash (Mi'kmaq), the highest ranking woman in AIM — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> including her rape and murder, which remains officially unsolved although Russell Means and others believe it was an inside job by AIM members who believed she was an FBI informant</span>.
</li><li> The main story in 1953's <em>Titanic</em> was derived from the real-life drama of the Navratil kidnapping, of course changing the various sexes, ages, nationalities, and ultimate outcome of the family involved.

For one, it only shows it taking one year when it actually encompassed four, the president of the Tucker Company was actually a good guy, but they needed a villain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/U571" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/U571">U-571</a></em> took quite a bit of flak for basically ignoring history when it came to how the Enigma was captured - starting with the fact that it was a British operation conducted in 1940. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyBlair">Tony Blair</a> denounced this at the time for stealing a British accomplishment. The truth was acknowledged briefly before the credits.
</li><li> Franny and Rosetta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderThePiano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnderThePiano">Under the Piano</a></em> were loosely based on Dolly and Henrietta Giardini. Dolly was born with a paralyzed arm while Henrietta was autistic, so the two sisters were very dependent on each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUntoldStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUntoldStory">The Untold Story</a></em> is said to be based on a true story but there doesn't seem to be much information on the supposed killings. Considering there is a sequel to this movie, it may have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrailersAlwaysLie">hype</a>.
</li><li> The trailer for the ghost movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhiteNoise">White Noise</a></em> opened with a minute-long explanation of EVP (electronic voice phenomenon) complete with "real" examples of the phenomena (which were actually made up) in an attempt to sell the audience on the film. It didn't quite work. Similarly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignRemake">US remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shutter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shutter">Shutter</a></em> opens with an explanation of spirit photography and a montage of photos with blurry, half-resolved images showing up, complete with mentions of how the people in the photos died soon after.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWindAndTheLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWindAndTheLion">The Wind and the Lion</a></em> is a retelling of the 1904 <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perdicaris#Perdicaris_incident">"Perdicaris incident,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which a Berber bandit (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a>) kidnaps an American (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CandiceBergen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CandiceBergen">Candice Bergen</a>), leading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> to send in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Marines</a>... except, in real life, Perdicaris was a man, and there was a lot less shooting and swordplay than the movie suggests.
</li><li> The 'based on true events' part of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WolfCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WolfCreek">Wolf Creek</a></em> seems to be limited to "there were some British backpackers murdered in Australia one time." And the movie was actually written <em>prior to</em> the disappearance of Peter Falconio and Ivan Milat's killings, but was not filmed until years later — so, cashing in rather than inspiration. For the record, neither case happened anywhere near (within a thousand miles of) Wolf Creek; the Ivan Milat murders didn't even happen in the outback.
</li><li> The opening disclaimer makes it clear that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheYoungPoisonersHandbook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheYoungPoisonersHandbook">The Young Poisoner's Handbook</a></em> is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Biopic">Biopic</a>, but a rather a story inspired by the life and crimes of Graham Young.

</li><li> <em>Atrocitology: Humanity's 100 Deadliest Achievements</em> by Matthew White is a non-fiction example. It is about mass killings in history, and the author's introduction says "Let's get something out of the way right now. Everything you are about to read is disputed." Some people deny that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">some mass killings</a> even happened, and in other cases everyone agrees that a lot of people died, but there is legitimate disagreement about how many, and from which cause.

</li><li> "Landfill": Joyce Carol Oates was inspired by news of the mysterious death of a college student to write this story. If anyone interpreted the story as being what actually happened, it would be a serious libel on the student's frat brothers and others. Faced by criticism from the student's family and accused of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">sensationalism and exploitation</a>, Oates said that the story was never meant to be taken as anything but fiction, and that she writes however she's inspired to, news being an important source of ideas for her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BringEmBackAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BringEmBackAlive">Bring 'Em Back Alive</a></em> was very loosely based on the life of real world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatWhiteHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatWhiteHunter">Great White Hunter</a> Frank Buck (and takes its title from his first volume of memoirs).

Justified, since the dramas are usually loose adaptations of novels that are also only loosely based on real events. Sometimes this is because of a scarcity of accurate information about the real people. Sometimes it's because a historically accurate story just wouldn't be interesting.
<ul><li> Examples from series set during the Qin and Three Kingdoms era: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdvisorsAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdvisorsAlliance">The Advisor's Alliance</a></em> stays reasonably close to the historical Sima Yi's biography. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KingsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KingsWar">King's War</a></em> invents some characters and events. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingsWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingsWoman">The King's Woman</a></em> has a handful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalDomainCharacter">Historical Domain Characters</a>, but everything else is completely fictional.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ColdCase">Cold Case</a></em> based many of its episodes off of infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> murders. And even those not based on specific cases were based around the issues of the era in which they were set.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Colditz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Colditz">Colditz</a></em> operated similarly. All the onscreen characters are fictional, including the camp commandant and chief of security, but many share similarities with real-life counterparts. Some are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">composites of real POWs</a>. The plots and character drama are likewise invented, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatEscape">except for the escape attempts, which are all based on real attempts</a>. To preserve the drama, the results of escape attempts are occasionally changed too - a real-life successful method was no guarantee of success in the series.
</li><li> <em>The Curse of Steptoe</em>, a docudrama by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> about the making of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SteptoeAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SteptoeAndSon">Steptoe and Son</a></em> proved to be <em>too</em> loosely based on the true story. Following complaints from Harry H. Corbett's family it was edited before being repeated, and preceded by a declaration "The following drama is inspired by the lives of real people. For the purpose of the narrative some events have been invented or conflated". Following <em>further</em> complaints it was edited <em>again</em>. Following more complaints, the BBC Trust ruled that it just shouldn't be shown and the DVDs should be recalled. The sticking point was the implication that Corbett's relationship with his second wife preceded the breakup of his first marriage, although it was also pointed out that the basic idea behind the story - that Corbett and Brambell hated each other and felt the show ruined their careers - was not supported by anyone who knew them.
</li><li> The courtroom dramas of the 1980s, including the original <em>Divorce Court</em>, and fellow court dramas <em>Superior Court</em> and <em>The Judge</em>. All stories were said to be "based on actual cases," but with the names changed.
</li><li> The codifying trope is probably Jack Webb's Mark VII shows, starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet">Dragnet</a></em>, in which "the names have been changed to protect the innocent." His other productions, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve">Adam-12</a></em> also included the disclaimer that everything was based on true events, which is a trifle funny when the episode revolved around Jim's inability to tell jokes or Friday and Gannon's weekend sleepover.
<ul><li> The 1987 comedy movie version of <em>Dragnet</em> parodies this with its opening announcement:
<div class="indent">"The story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent. For example, 'George Baker' is now called 'Sylvia Weiss'."
</div></li><li> Comedy recording "St. George and the Dragonet" used a similar parody:

All the characters who appear on-screen are fictional, including those prominent enough to have appeared in the historical record; for instance, the major in charge of the occupying forces, though he shares some similarities with his real-life counterpart, is basically an invented character with an invented name. The plots are likewise invented. Some of the scenes in the first episode depicting the arrival of the Germans are based on actual events, but even those take full advantage of dramatic license.

John Dodge really was an American-born British Army officer interned with RAF prisoners but he played no part in the murder investigation. Von Lindeiner, the Commandant, was not executed, he moved to London after the war. Most egregious was the depiction of Burchardt, the mastermind of the murders. Burchardt and Dodge face off in the climatic battle, Dodge armed with a pistol and Burchardt only with a rhinoceros hide whip. Dodge, nearly defeated, finally shoots and kills Burchardt. Burchardt was actually just one of the mooks in real life and received light punishment in the end. About the only facts in the mini series were that there was an investigation and prosecution of the murderers of "the fifty", John Dodge did escape from Sachsenhausen concentation camp after his recapture and Burchardt did own a rhinoceros hide whip.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> bases most of their stories on (or off—often <em>way</em> off) real cases and incidents. In order to be able to deny that they're referencing a certain real person, they may insert a remark to show that the real person also exists in the fictional world. For example, in one episode that featured a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">No Celebrities Were Harmed</a> Ann Coulter, one character remarks that she "makes Ann Coulter look like a socialist" or some such remark.

<ul><li> And the episode where a husband's fight to remove the feeding tube from his comatose wife led to his murder. Needless to say the people fighting to keep the wife alive are the killers.
</li><li> One episode of SVU combined two current events into one story with the first half referencing a pregnancy pact and the second based off the story of a teen who committed suicide apparently after her online boyfriend dumped her and humiliated her. It turned out that the boyfriend didn't exist and was the creation of the mother of the girl's friend that had a falling out with and created the boyfriend to find out what the girl was saying about her daughter. The account ended up falling into the hands of other people close to the woman.
</li><li> These examples are interesting inversions, because they are often closer than the truth than other works that are purported to be "based on true events," but they are always very careful to let us know that it has nothing to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> events.

A Chronicle is a piece of historic fiction, intended to glorify the participants in a particular event, whereas a History is a bare-bones account of the facts surrounding a place or an event, and there are often both Histories and Chronicles describing the same events. For example, the Kharzim Chronicle stated that Kharzim drove back a Tirak horde so large that "grass no longer grew where it marched" from the gates of Hazr at the cost of his own life. The History of Hazr describes the same event as follows: "Skirmish with Tiraks at Hazr, Kharzim and 68 others dead. Enemy dead uncounted, but number does not exceed 200. Supplies running low, negotiations with humans concerning construction of trading post at Hazr in progress." The fun begins when well-meaning but clueless scholars from other cultures start taking Chronicles at face value.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Theater </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The 1934 play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheChildrensHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheChildrensHour">The Children's Hour</a></em> is based on the events of a 1810 Scottish court case. A student accused her two female teachers of having an affair. Subsequently, the girls grandmother removed her from the school, and, thanks to her affluencey, the grandmother was able to have the other parents do the same within a matter of days. The central difference is that the real women, Jane and Marianne, won the case while Karen and Martha lost theirs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheCrucible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheCrucible">The Crucible</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurMiller">Arthur Miller</a>, which is based on the Salem Witch Trials. While some of the broad strokes are true (specifically, the identities of those who died, as well as the accusers), a lot of the details are not.
<ul><li> The play portrays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToLoveInterest">an affair</a> between Abigail Williams and John Proctor as the motivating factor behind Abigail accusing Proctor of witchcraft. There's no historical evidence that the pair even knew each other before Abigail made the accusation. What's more, the real Abigail Williams was no more than twelve years old, while the real John Proctor was about sixty; in order to make the affair plausible, Miller <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">raised Abigail's age</a> to seventeen, while lowering Proctor's to somewhere in his thirties. (Miller himself admitted that he changed the ages of some of the characters.)
</li><li> While Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth was a real person, the Danforth character bears almost no resemblence to his real life counterpart. The real Danforth was extremely skeptical of the accusations and critical of the trials as a whole, and ultimately had a hand in the process being brought to a halt when it did. Many people believe that the fictional Danforth is actually based on a completely different historical figure, Magistrate William Stoughton.
</li><li> In the play, Thomas Putnam is a greedy and conniving man who uses the accusations to increase his own fortune, while his wife Ann is succeptible to the claims because she has lost all but one of her children and witchcraft gives her something to blame. In reality, while some historians believe that a feud between the Putnams and another family may have played a role in their daughter's accusations, there is no historical evidence to suggest a scheme of anywhere near the magnitude of what the play attributes to Thomas. As for Ann, her heartbreaking loss is equally fictional; of the Putnams' twelve children, ten outlived their parents.
<ul><li> In a more minor example, the Putnams' daughter is referred to in the play as Ruth, while the Putnam daughter at the center of the Trials was Ann Putnam Jr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> because calling the daughter Ann could lead to the character being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">confused with her mother</a>.
</li><li> Ann Putnam Jr. was also a major player in the Trials, with some historians even believing that <em>she</em> was the one who started it (although probably with less deliberate malice than what the play attributes to Abigail). In the play, her counterpart Ruth is such a minor player that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">doesn't even appear</a> in person, but is only mentioned.
</li></ul></li><li> The play ends with Abigail Williams running off with Mercy Lewis after stealing her uncle's fortune; the epilogue notes that, "The legend has it that Abigail turned up later as a prostitute in Boston." In reality, nobody knows what happened to Abigail, who disappears from historical records after the end of the Trials. Mercy Lewis did go to Boston, but it was to live with a relative; there's no indication that her departure was abrupt or secretive the way the fictional character's was, nor is there any reason to think that Abigail went with her.

<ul><li> Frost and Nixon were already well-acquainted. Frost interviewed Nixon in 1968, when he was still a presidential candidate, and hosted the 1971 White House Christmas party.
</li><li> On the Nixon team, Col. Jack Brennan was actually a pleasant man with a keen sense of humor rather than the hardcore humorless Marine he's portrayed as.
</li><li> The drunken midnight phone call by Nixon to Frost never happened; it was inserted mainly as a way to climb inside a private man and show some similarities between the two opponents.
</li><li> Caroline Cushing did not meet David Frost by chance as he prepared for the interviews, but had actually been dating him for some time.
</li><li> The biggest of all: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nixon <strong>did not</strong> confess to being part of a cover-up during the interviews, though he did admit to and apologize for disappointing the American people</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lin-Manuel Miranda's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em> has a pile of convenient historical edits, which include but are not limited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings">siblings</a> being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">adapted out</a>, a change in the timing of a number of historical events, and also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheLivingRoom">the fact they're a cast of multiracial rappers</a>.
<ul><li> Though if you worry about historical accuracy because of what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge">people might think is true</a> then the racial identities and vocal styles of the actors are not very important.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/InheritTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/InheritTheWind">Inherit the Wind</a></em> heavily fictionalizes the real-life Scopes Trial, which in truth was a simple misdemeanor charge played up by the town of Dayton, TN as a publicity stunt. John Scopes was not arrested in his classroom, he was never sent to jail, the fine levied against him was tossed out by the judge (after prosecutor William Jennings Bryan offered to pay it himself), and the prosecutor was not dramatically struck dead at the reading of the verdict. The play's preface states that the work is based on but but does not accurately reflect historical events. The film adaptations, on the other hand, do not, leading many to mistakenly believe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge">the events portrayed in the story are what actually happened</a>.
</li><li> When <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHenryHwang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidHenryHwang">David Henry Hwang</a> heard over the radio of the incident that formed the basis of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MButterfly">M. Butterfly</a></em>, he deliberately didn't do any more research, because he wanted an original artistic creation, not something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a>. He openly admitted this, however, and changed the names of those involved, so he probably shouldn't be ripped on as much as certain individuals above.
<ul><li> Peter Shaffer did the same thing when writing <em>Equus</em>. He read a newspaper article about a teenager who blinded six horses, then wrote a story that would explain it.
</li><li> Shaffer also wrote <em>Amadeus</em>, a heavily fictionalized biography of Salieri, one of Mozart's contemporaries.
</li></ul></li><li> The play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MySisterEileen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MySisterEileen">My Sister Eileen</a></em>, which later became the musical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WonderfulTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WonderfulTown">Wonderful Town</a>, is based on a couple of autobiographical stories (namely, "Mr. Spitzer and the Fungus" and "Beware the Brazilian Navy") by Ruth McKenney published under the same title. All the names were changed, except for Eileen and Ruth's first names, and many details of the stories were altered or simply made up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pagliacci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a></em>, as its Prologue alludes to: when composer Ruggero Leoncavallo was a boy, a servant from his household was murdered by a professional commedia dell'arte performer over a love triangle, and Leoncavallo's judge father oversaw the criminal investigation. Leoncavallo adapted the incident very freely, though. In real life, the woman both men fancied was not the killer's wife, nor was she killed, and the murder did not take place onstage during a commedia dell'arte performance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">Older Than Steam</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> took many liberties with some of his historical plays. Usually just because it'd make a better story, but he was prepared to go over the top to suck up to his royal patrons. One example for each monarch:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RichardIII">Richard III</a> was the last Plantagenet, who lost the Wars of the Roses to Elizabeth I's Tudors (which is why they are invariably the heroes to Plantagenet villains in the historical plays). What little paperwork remains from his reign suggests he was a reasonable, competent type with a reputation for bravery justified by his death in battle — the last English monarch to do so, as it happens. This impression is at odds with that of the ruthless near-sociopath who murdered several of his 'allies', his wife, brother and two of his cousins and wished to marry a third to secure his succession. Also, Richard is typically portrayed as being old and severely deformed (Laurence Olivier, here's to lookin' at you) — though he died at 32 with at most a minor deformity of one shoulder — so minor that there is disagreement as to which shoulder it was. (And it could have been due to overtraining — Richard's favorite weapon was the axe, which can't be as easily switched from one side to the other as a sword can.)
<ul><li> Although, now that they've found the body we know that he did in fact have worsening <a class="urllink" href="http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/spine.html">scoliosis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he didn't live nearly long enough to become a hunchback.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6JczvS1PL4">Discussed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxTim7fJLis">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorribleHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorribleHistories">Horrible Histories</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> James I traced his lineage back to Banquo, and Shakespeare wanted to make a good first impression, so he dragged poor King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a> through the mud. For example, the real Duncan was not a wise, old king, he was a young man who wasted his wealth. Also, the real Duncan was killed in a fair fight with Macbeth, instead of being assassinated in his sleep. Lady Macbeth, whose real name was Gruoch, outlived her (second) husband. Lulach, her son by her first husband, became king of Scotland before Malcolm.
</li></ul></li><li> The play <em>Two Shakespearean Actors</em> centers around the events of the 1849 Astor Place Riots. While the historical event is real, the story is highly fictionalized
<ul><li> Perhaps most notably, of the play's thirty-plus characters, less than a dozen are real people. Even among those who are, several are based on individuals about whom little is known, so while the names and some basic details are drawn from historical records, the specific characterizations are still largely the playwright's creation.
</li><li> The play shows the dynamic between Forrest and Macready as a relatively friendly rivalry, with Forrest even helping to hide Macready from the rioters. In reality, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeUsedToBeFriends">they had once been friends</a>, their friendship had long since deteriorated and by the time of the riot, they were bitter enemies.
</li><li> In a more justified case, the play depicts Forrest as engaged in an extramarital affair, much to the consternation of his scorned wife. The reality is less clear: in the course of their divorce, both Forrest and his wife were charged with infidelity. While the court ruled at the time that Forrest was the one having the affair (which is why this depiction is relatively justified), some historians believe that it was his wife, Catherine, who was actually unfaithful.

To much confusion as to whether Himuro Mansion was real or not.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JeanneDArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JeanneDArc">Jeanne d'Arc</a></em> is based loosely on the events of the Hundred Years' War, with the <em>dramatis personae</em>, many historical events (such as the siege of Orleans, the assault on Les Tourelles), and the circumstances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc">Jeanne d'Arc's</a> capture all corresponding with the true history. It also happens to add in a few...interesting details such as how the English army was lead by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> possessing Henry VI and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionsOfHell">Legions of Hell</a>, the hidden war between the forces of humanity and the Netherworld, the fact that Jeanne d'Arc was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior">Magical Girl Warrior</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and <em>wasn't</em> the girl captured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">and burned at the stake</a>. That was her childhood friend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyDouble">Body Double</a> Leanne</span>.
</li><li> The arcade game <em>Operation Thunderbolt</em> (the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OperationWolf">Operation Wolf</a></em>) is likely very loosely based on the real "Operation Thunderbolt", one of a number of names for an Israeli military raid on Entebbe, Uganda in order to free hostages.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PeretEmHeruForThePrisoners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PeretEmHeruForThePrisoners">Peret em Heru: For the Prisoners</a></em> references the Luxor Massacre, a tragedy where several tourists were slaughtered while visiting an archeological site. Among the victims were nine Japanese tourists and their guide. The main plot of the game revolves around Professor Tsuchida and his assistant Dr. Kuroe tricking a group of <em>eight</em> Japanese tourists and their guide into accompanying them on a dangerous exploration. It's also revealed late in the game that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tsuchida and Kuroe were present at the Luxor Massacre, with Tsuchida's own daughter among the casualties</span>.
</li><li> <em>Vampire Legends: The True Story of Kisilova</em> claims to be based on the first written historical account of alleged vampirism. The game contains surprisingly little sensationalism and almost nothing which could be interpreted as being in any way supernatural.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThisWarOfMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThisWarOfMine">This War of Mine</a></em> is one of the few instances where this trope isn't a bad thing. Aside from the gameplay and atmosphere being influenced by the Siege of Serajevo and the Bosnian War, the rest of the game is a a deliberately generic setting to avoid drowning out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a> theme it tries to convey.
</li><li> In general Japanese game developers tend to have extreme liberties with their own Sengoku era and China's Three Kingdoms era, even more than the example of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em> above. Listing these games would be suicidal mission, but let's say the only exceptions are the strategy adaptations such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NobunagasAmbition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NobunagasAmbition">Nobunaga's Ambition</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>.

<ul><li> The concept for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> is based on, as well as a heavy parody of, the heinously unfair and brutal legal system of Japan that was in use at the time of the series' creation. Not only is the way the trials work based on real life Japanese trials, but the brutal statistics (such as 99% guilty rate), harshness towards the defence, unfairly unbalanced advantage for the Prosecution and ridiculously chaotic claims are also all based on what was really happening in Japanese courts during the early 2000's, although of course, exaggerated.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em>, the unfair system is at the center of the entire game, and after a murderer is nearly let off the hook due to the stupid nature of the way the courts run, a new system to bring back the idea of a jury into the courts is introduced. This is directly based on what was happening in Japan at the time of <em>Apollo Justice</em>'s release, where the Japanese courts were switching over to a jury system.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em> is based on an event back in 2000 where a forum poster by the name of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Titor">John Titor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed up on a number of boards and claimed to be a soldier from the future, sent back in time to retrieve an IBM 5100 in order to avert a disastrous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> - it's just in <em>Steins;Gate</em>, he was being entirely honest about everything <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except her name and gender</span>.
