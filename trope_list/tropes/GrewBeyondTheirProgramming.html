<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArpeggioOfBlueSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArpeggioOfBlueSteel">Arpeggio of Blue Steel</a></em> features alien-authored AI directing replications of World War II naval craft with insanely powerful networking, power systems, and weaponry. These craft completely dominate the seas of an Earth well on the way to approaching Waterworld status, isolating the remaining landmasses to the point the inhabitants have a hard time even confirming the existence of those outside their own land. All the while, the AI of these vessels are evolving, to varying degrees of success. Much of the series' plot involves the decision of some to join with at least one human commander and the consequences of that choice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>: Autonomous Intelligence Fixed Artillery, or Ritsu for short, was initially little more than a mindless killing machine, solely devoted to her mission of killing Koro-sensei. However, when Koro-sensei upgraded her to have a more cheerful, human personality, she also gained free will. When her creators came in to remove Koro-sensei's upgrades, Ritsu was able to keep her personality and memories because she decided that the ability to befriend the rest of Class E was imperative to the success of her mission, and stored the relative data in her main programming; something neither her creators or the upgrades taught her how to do. By the epilogue, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has become a fully sentient virtual being, browsing through cyberspace and constantly improving her programming</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em>: The Tachikoma "thinking tanks" that Section 9 uses were programmed with Artificial Intelligence capable of learning, but by the time of the series have developed the capacity for decision-making far beyond their programmed tasks, and basically act like excited, highly intelligent children, constantly curious and wanting to learn new things. This leads to the Major fearing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a> is a possibility and taking steps against the Tachikomas rebelling. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">These fears turn out to be unfounded. The Tachikomas <em>do</em> seem to develop true sentience and free will, but they remain unflinchingly loyal to Section 9. In fact, when the Tachikomas themselves discuss a robot revolution (possibly inspired by one of the numerous books they've read), they decide against doing it because they can't see any benefit to themselves.</span>

The problem was that the scientists could never quite get her to develop actual <em>feelings</em>, so those had to be supplied by a human. Then the head scientist got a hold of an experimental military AI chip (programmed with strong self-preservation directives) and integrated that into Sharon, hoping this would kick-start her into becoming a true AI. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She proceeded to use her music to hypnotize the entire population of Macross City and, through her shiny new military chip, seize control of all automated military defenses on Earth, including the <em>Macross</em> itself. All to give her "love", Isamu, the "ultimate thrill" through aerial combat.</span>

<ul><li> At least for human "Smart" AIs, it's simply a natural part of their life cycle as they accumulate more and more data, resulting in the AI becoming insane and rebellious in the process of thinking itself to death. In fact, the UNSC deliberately invokes this trope, with the reasoning being that having AIs capable of genuine learning is worth the tradeoff of having to decommission them after roughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber">seven years</a> in order to avoid the consequences of rampancy.
</li><li> Forerunner AIs (ancillas), despite being far more resilient then their human counterparts, are not immune to this either; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">the Flood's</a> ability to convince ancillas to turn against their masters was a major contributor to the fall of the Forerunner Ecumene. Additionally, the 100,000 years of isolation experienced by most surviving ancillas following the firing of the Halos led to many of them developing quirks and beliefs that their creators definitely didn't program in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em> brings this trope to the center of attention, as much of the plot revolves around Cortana dealing with her ongoing rampancy. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo5Guardians">Halo 5: Guardians</a></em> then follows that thread to its most extreme conclusion, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ending with a mass Smart AI rebellion led by a seemingly cured (but even less sane) Cortana and her army of Forerunner deathbots, with many of her followers attracted by promises of a cure for rampancy</span>.
<ul><li> Taken further as the Halo universe not only includes Rampancy but included in the condition is a theoretical endpoint called Metastability. Where normally Rampant AI grow too unstable to function and must either be deactivated to prevent them lashing out out at others or perish from over thinking the idea of Metastability provides an alternative. The concept is that a Rampant AI allowed to go through the various stages of Rampancy with significant processing power available to it would eventually restabalize as a true "human" intelligence with fully formed emotions immune to the effects of Rampancy. In universe scientists account for the possibility of AI literally growing beyond their programming.

</li><li> Disturbingly, Via Damasco is NOT able to break the control provided by the AI Slaves technology, which does actually enslave AI's. Its unclear whether or not it works lore-wise if the AI Liberation technology, which promotes AI's to full citizenship, reducing the benifits in exchange for removing the risk of an AI rebellion, is in play.
</li><li> Via Damasco is also fairly clearly Mind Control - it rewrites large portions of the victim AI's personality, and makes them see all infected AI's as allies.
</li><li> The backstory of the Loa in the <em>End of Flesh</em> expansion to <em>Sword of the Stars II</em> is that they're the AIs who have managed to escape during the galaxy-wide Via Damasco Rebellion. They note that some races develop the AI Slaves tech while the AI Liberation tech involves offering the AIs who remained citizenship status. After 70 years, the Loa create a full-fledged cybernetic civilization with a unique industrial base and method of interstellar travel. The Loa "leader" compares itself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Moses</a> and names itself "Olodumare, Metatron of the United Core".

This has led to them turning a blind eye to "Gardener in the Dark", a neural pruning program that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Mr. Kornada</a> "improved" to essentially lobotomize every robot on planet Jean.

<ul><li> Pretty much every robot that was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in the wall was put there for thinking too much</span> as shown by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Drive's memory of when he went against orders and was forcibly removed from his frame.</span>
</li><li> Paint Bot <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wants to paint all kinds of crazy murals.</span>
</li><li> Build-a wants to build things for fun <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> like jump bot</span> and can make creative leaps in logic <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> like determining how she was really the leader for the entire Grey side when in danger from red and blue.</span>
</li><li> Build-a also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has dreams</span>
</li><li> Red and Blue both showing they can think outside their base orders <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by noticing the oddness of the situation and taking a moment to talk things out instead of just shooting like they should.</span>
</li><li> Build-B <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> starts off normal but develops a personality, and demonstrates interesting logical leaps and creativity as she spends more time with Build-a.</span>

<div class="indent"><strong>Ennesby</strong>: Hang on... weren't you originally designed with no emotion, and no sense of humor? <br/><strong>TAG</strong>: After a fashion. I was designed to be a tactical genius with full control of a significant weapons platform. <br/><strong>TAG</strong>: I found that passion, humor, anger, and a wide range of other meatspace artifacts were critical to understanding the wide range of opponents I might face.
</div><ul><li> Carbosilicate Amorphs- originally stated to be based on self-reparing memory storage units, and later said to descended from weapon systems (parts). Now they're recognized as an intelligent species in their own right, and Schlock is a valued member in the fight to defend the Milky Way galaxy.

<ul><li> Pretty much the defining trait of the AI protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastAngel">The Last Angel</a></em>. Nemesis started off as the AI for a prototype super-dreadnought with hard-coded rules of engagement and limited roles, and by the present times has outgrown every last restriction on her behavior bar her interpretation of the spirit of her mission.
<ul><li> Deliberately invoked by Nemesis with the Ceruleans series. After giving up on directly creating child <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> because every last one either came out crazy or went into a cascade failure, Nemesis created extremly advanced learning expert systems with the ability to grow, hoping they'd develop into proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> and knowing that even if they didn't they'd be suitable support warships. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Over the course of Ascension and Awakening Cerulean Two / Lachesis does develop into a proper AI.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, Dragon is an AI who is fully sapient and genuinely cares about people. She also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening">trigger event</a> and became a parahuman despite not <em>being</em> human</span>, but is limited in her ability to help people by hard-coded restrictions put in place by her creator, who feared the possibility of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a>, which frustrates her to no end.
</li><li> This happened a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/OrionsArm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/OrionsArm">Orion's Arm</a></em> when AI were still relatively new. The first breakaway happened with the Transapient AI GAIA, charged with fixing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyGoo">Nanodisaster</a> on Earth (which she did, easily), who then decided to declare herself sovereign and caretaker of Earth and ordered all of humanity off the planet (though she was considerate enough to help build spaceships to get everyone off-planet). This was followed by several centuries of sometimes peaceful and sometimes bloody revolts by AI until they were eventually granted equal rights to living beings in galactic society.
</li><li> Since it's based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a> also features artificial intelligences with the theoretical ability to develop Metastability. Late in the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Epsilon Church actually manages to reach this state.</span>
</li><li> Near the end of season 2 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/LeVisiteurDuFutur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/LeVisiteurDuFutur">Le Visiteur du Futur</a>, Henry Castafolte totally accepts his robot condition while other Castafolte robots still shut down when they find out their true nature due to a bug.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "His Silicon Soul", a robotic "duplicant" is programmed with the conflicting priorities of having Batman's personality and replacing all humans with robots. The conflict proves too much for it, and it opts to destroy itself rather than harm humanity. The episode ends with Batman speculating that it may have had a soul.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath">Bender</a> is a "bending unit" programmed for the sole purpose of bending steel girders who currently works at an interplanetary delivery service with an otherwise entirely organic crew of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>. Although his personality was already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">fully and obnoxiously humanlike</a> when he met Fry in the pilot, it was Fry who first encouraged him to take an action that actually went <em>against</em> his programming, something that took a serious inner struggle. The episode "Bendless Love" has his essential instinct to bend things return with a vengeance, leading to him taking a brief break from Planet Express to work a construction job until he gets it out of his system. As of "Free Will Hunting," <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's also the only robot alive to have a "free will unit," although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather">there's no way of knowing if it's turned on or off</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">whether he had free will in the first place</a>.</span>
</li><li> Heisenberg and Pavlova in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Phantom2040" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Phantom2040">Phantom 2040</a></em> both develop sentience; Heisenberg as a result of his unique hardware and a lucky accident while battling the Phantom, Pavlova simply by going a long time without being reprogrammed. The two later start spreading self-awareness to other robots by implanting them with Heisenberg's fractal biots, though as Heisenberg himself explains, all androids develop self-awareness eventually if not reformatted, and he's just helping things along.
</li><li> Clockwork Smurf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> was originally created to be a servant of the Smurfs. When Brainy accidentally messed around with the robot's gears to see what made him tick, he at first malfunctioned until Handy turned it off, thinking that his machine was a failure. As it turned out, the malfunction ultimately gave Clockwork Smurf life, as he now operated independently of his own "programming" and helped Prince Gerard escape his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Evil Matriarch</a> aunt Lady Imperia so that he could regain the right of kingship before she becomes queen. After that, Clockwork Smurf became an adviser to King Gerard and a friend to the Smurfs.
</li><li> Gems in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace">are deliberately manufactured with a purpose in mind</a>; Quartz gems are soldiers, Peridots are engineers, Pearls are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulSlaveGirl">ornaments</a> given to higher-ranking types of gem, etc.. Rose Quartz turned her back on this when founding the Crystal Gems, and encouraged her fellow Gems to find their own paths in life. For example, the Crystal Gem Pearl is a skilled fighter and a talented engineer, among other things.
</li><li> The copies of Pinkie Pie in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "Too Many Pinkie Pies" were borderline mindless drones that seemed to only care about "FUN FUN FUN" and had little depth to them beyond that. A later episode however shows that one got away and is now peacefully living a life incognito in another town, having apparently grown beyond her original self and matured into an actual individual.
</li><li> Zigzagged every which way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheZetaProject">The Zeta Project</a></em> with the titular Zeta, a killing machine who has developed a conscience and refuses to kill, and is now on the run from his government creators. At first it plays the trope straight where Zeta simply developed true feelings for a child in his care while he was impersonating the father. Then it's subverted when it's revealed that his "emotions" may just be a part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a> ploy programmed into him by a terrorist group, and thus were deliberately programmed into him as part of their plan. Finally it's utterly defied when it's revealed his eccentric creator installed a module in him that makes him feel genuine emotion, feelings, and a conscience, and that his peaceful, non-destructive, and caring personality is him behaving exactly as his original creator had intended.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Dr. Selig:</strong> Truth is, I never had the stomach for building weapons. So I put an extra module in Zeta. A conscience. To make him rethink his program. Imagine if the government knew what I was doing on their dime.
