Documentaries (even educational ones) are more interesting when there's a fight or one-sided argument. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">Reality TV</a> shows thrive on conflict between the contestants. Theoretically, the conflicts are all the more gripping because they are <em>real</em> — no scripts, no second takes, and little editing. Everything that happened really happened, just as it's shown.
</p><p>And if you believe that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandmarkSale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandmarkSale">I've got a bridge I'd like to sell you</a>.
</p><p>In point of fact, there <em>are</em> writers on reality TV shows, documentaries, and even the news. There can be "OK, can you say that again, only this time with more emotion". And there are <em>certainly</em> editors whose job it is to compress a long discussion into a few sentences. While the specific <em>events</em> may be outside of the producers' direct control (although that varies depending on the show — and don't count out less <em>direct</em> influences), editing often compresses hours, days, or weeks into mere minutes, and <em>how</em> the events are compressed can alter the meaning of a scene, twist a person's apparent attitude, and alter "reality" to the point that it's barely recognizable to those who were present for the actual events.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Some common forms of Manipulative Editing include:
</p><ul><li> Missing or misused context is the single most common type of manipulative editing, and is at least an element of virtually every other kind. At the most basic level, it creates a relationship between two unrelated events, or removes a connection that should have been there. This one is much, much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision">Older Than Television</a>, as people have been quoting their rivals out of context to make them look bad since time immemorial.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine">Cherry-picking quotes</a> from an interview or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam">Confession Cam</a> can turn a fair and balanced statement into a one-sided snark-fest. It's easy to cut off the <em>buts</em> and <em>excepts</em> that would soften a statement, and that's without deeper shenanigans.
<ul><li> The "Frankenbite" is where different soundbites are stitched together to create a new whole. Sometimes this is done with the best intentions; people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealisticDictionIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealisticDictionIsUnrealistic">ramble and digress, give examples, and in general do not speak in well-formed soundbites</a>. Often, editors will cut out the unnecessary pieces of a sentence to get to the heart of the matter in a timely way. But it can be misused just as easily; splice together the start of one sentence with the end of another or remove a phrase to change the meaning. Or just take the words needed, without their context. A hint for catching this one  if the scene shifts mid-sentence, there's no guarantee that all the words came from the same discussion. The phrases being spliced together may not even be <em>talking about the same person or event</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Cherry-picking scenes. Showing only certain parts of a relationship can easily create an illusion that has little to do with the reality. Imagine if your entire relationship with your best friend was to be summed up in ten minutes. Now imagine that the summation consisted of your combined worst ten minutes  your loudest arguments, your worst fights, your angriest moments ever. If someone who didn't know you or your friend saw only the summation, he might well conclude that you had once been friends, but were now mortal enemies.
<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Worst-side shooting. This is particularly present in Reality TV, which can have a demanding schedule, and the days can be stressful to the point of exhausting. If it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTVShowMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTVShowMansion">Reality TV Show Mansion</a> show, then the contestants are also in near-total isolation, with no phones, no laptops, no music players... They have nothing to interact with besides each other, twenty-four hours a day, for weeks on end. It's natural that tired, stressed people get upset and have fights over little things. Without being in that situation, it's easy to conclude that some or all of the people are petty and cruel, when in fact they are just acting like stressed, bored people in close proximity.
</li><li> Invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">Poe's Law</a>. Imagine if you were to do an impression of something that's intentionally done to look and/or sound silly. It's filmed, and the part where you indicate that you're doing an impression and laughing at yourself is left on the cutting room floor so it appears that you really <em>are</em> like that.
</li></ul></li><li> Causal deletion. It's true that, sometimes, people do things for no reason. Most of the time, though, they have very good reasons — but if the reasons get left on the cutting-room floor, it looks like they don't. This can make even the most justified anger seem petty and immature. For example, if the producers are casting Bob as a bad guy and Alice as a nice girl, they might cut out several days of on-and-off sniping and backbiting on Alice's part, showing only the moment when Bob has had enough and shouts at her, making Bob look like an unreasonable, overreactive jerk.
<ul><li> Denial of information. Sometimes important information, like an alliance forming or paranoia setting in, gets removed, which makes some acts seem like a snap decision when the people involved were actually mulling it over for hours, or even days.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccentuateTheNegative">Accentuating the Negative</a>. If Bob is a decent person most of the time but gets moody under stress, expect his nicer moments to be cut out—including any apologies—to make him look like a complete and utter jackass.
</li></ul></li><li> Pointed questions. Just because you don't see an interviewer does not mean one isn't there. An unseen, unheard producer may ask the person to talk about a particular subject or ask questions designed to provoke "better" sound bites, and then use only the most interesting bits. In older reality shows, this is often deceptively presented as if it were from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam">Confession Cam</a> (which, theoretically, has nobody else in the room), by having the person look directly at the camera while answering the producer's questions. Most shows nowadays are more honest about the fact that the person is being interviewed by someone offscreen, and in a few rare instances the producer themselves can be heard responding or asking a question, usually to underscore how dramatic or unusual a situation has become.
</li><li> Prompting. Sometimes the interviewee (often a contestant on a reality show) will simply be told "say this". It happens.
</li><li> Temporal shenanigans. Two events which took place days or weeks apart are shown to have happened nearly simultaneously, or close-together events get spaced out. This can add additional context that did not actually exist, or make emotions seem buried when they were actually dealt with much sooner. For example, if Bob says something about Alice just as Alice walks into the room, it's possible that Bob had actually said it several hours <em>earlier</em>, and Alice didn't hear it.
<ul><li> Switching around the order of events. This can be a tricky form of manipulative editing that makes the aftermath of an event appear to be its cause, or even make it seem like someone <em>willed</em> an event to happen (such as an injury) when they were talking or joking about it later. Combine this with cherry-picked comments for extra deception. For example, a shot of a worker looking at a piece of jury-rigged equipment and commenting, "That's not gonna hold for long," might be shown before the failure that necessitated the quick fix, making it appear that the worker predicted the failure and was ignored.
</li></ul></li><li> Music. Take a shot of a guy staring off into space. Add music, and suddenly he is heroic, wistful, or on the verge of launching his career as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> killer.

<ul><li> This Trope is often used in commercials for Italian live-action shows (and sometimes cartoons) to make the characters talk with the narration.
</li><li> Ads for beauty products (or just about anything) with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeforeAndAfterPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeforeAndAfterPictures">"Before" and "After" Pictures</a>. It's the same woman, and the photos themselves are unedited. They just take the before photo under less than ideal lighting to make the blemishes more visible.
</li><li> Similarly to beauty products, ads for weight loss or fitness programs will often rely on unflattering lighting, bad haircuts, poor posture, and other tricks to make people in the "before" pictures seem more out of shape, while the "after" shots are done with different lighting (lights shining from below a person, for example, casts shadows on their bodies to make muscles look more defined), better-cut clothing, and other optical illusions to sell the program.
<ul><li> One fitness model Youtuber demonstrated that in some cases, the person is <em>already</em> in phenomenal shape—the "after" picture is taken first. The model then pigs out on high-salt food and drinks over a gallon of chocolate milk; the combination <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalloonBelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalloonBelly">bloats his belly</a> and makes him generally appear puffier. The "before" picture is taken with the addition of bad lighting and posture, and behold—an extremely muscular, lean guy now looks like he desperately needs the product that's being hawked.
</li></ul></li><li> An Old Spice commercial featuring Washington Redskins linebacker Montez Sweat uses this to make it sound like he's endorsing being sweaty because of his last name:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sweat (actual quote):</strong> Sweat is just my last name. It's just a word. I don't represent sweat, and won't be a party to this at any time. <br/><strong>Voiceover:</strong> That's not what <em>we</em> heard! <br/><strong>Sweat (edited quote):</strong> I/represent sweat, and/it's/party/time.
</div></li><li> Happens a lot in political ads. One infamous example is making the claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">Al Gore said he invented the Internet.</a> There's often a clip playing that shows him saying, "I took the initiative in creating the Internet". This is taken out of context as afterwards he immediately says, "I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our countrys economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system". He is clearly stating that he was promoting the Internet in its early days in an economic and legislative sense.

The broadcast version of her death even goes so far as to give the impression that Peeta gave Rani the nightlock she used to kill herself on his own rather than Rani receiving it earlier as a sponsorship gift, although Katniss finds the editing so obvious that she can see that Ranis mouth doesnt match the words shes allegedly speaking.

First we see the unedited version, wherein the interview goes fairly normally as Amethyst paints a full picture of the Gems. Then we see the aired version, where it's noted that the interviewer is clearly in a different location than from where the interview took place, and Amethyst's responses have been cherry-picked to make it seem like she's proudly stating that the Crystal Gems are perverted criminals.

<ul><li> David Barton's documentary <em>Four Centuries of American Education</em> shows how manipulative editing can be used to make something look stronger than it really is. For example, he has an actor portraying Benjamin Rush recite a quote; this quote is modified by having the phrase "if we remove the Bible from schools" added, a sentence skipped, and "soul of republicanism" replaced with "soul of our government". The modified quote appears on various websites, but not in the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.biblebelievers.com/Bible_in_schools.html">original text<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> It's a major plot point in the 1987 movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRunningMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRunningMan">The Running Man</a></em>, specifically Ben Richards and his refusal to go through with the Bakersfield Massacre after seeing that those he was sent to kill were unarmed women and children  all despite the police ordering him to fire. The edited footage has the police ordering him to <em>retreat</em> and Richards refusing.
</li><li> In the 1994 comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clifford" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clifford">Clifford</a></em>, Martin Short plays a mischievous child who ruins his uncle's (played by Charles Grodin) life. In one scene, he has a recording of his uncle describing Clifford as "...a ticking time bomb that no one can stop. Even I do not have the patience to deal with this boy." Smash cut to Clifford editing the sound clips to send in a bomb threat. "I—-have a bomb that no one can stop. A ticking time bomb."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoore">Michael Moore</a> does this in his documentaries. A lot.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BowlingForColumbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BowlingForColumbine">Bowling for Columbine</a></em>:
<ul><li> The opening scene featured a bank that offered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BankToaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BankToaster">free rifle</a> for opening a bank and showed him walk in, open the account, and then cut to him in the parking lot with said rifle in hand to imply the bank just handed it to him. Yeah... no. The bank actually did offer a free rifle in the form of a voucher you had to take to a participating sporting goods store to redeem, and you most definitely had to pass the background check and be legally entitled to own the firearm to begin with. Of course that's a pretty reasonable way to do things so the parking lot scene was filmed later and spliced in to "prove" Moore's point.
</li><li> He showed what a heartless bastard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharltonHeston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharltonHeston">Charlton Heston</a> was for holding an NRA fundraiser in Colorado shortly after the Columbine massacre and gloating with the "cold, dead fingers" speech to mock the victims. While the NRA did indeed hold an event in Colorado —because rescheduling it was legally impossible by that point— sharp-eyed viewers may notice that Heston is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">wearing a different suit for the "cold dead fingers" line</a> than he wears in the rest of the footage.
</li><li> Another recurring and particularly blatant example is essentially any interview scene with a clock in the background of one or both participants. Mismatched times between the interviewer and the interviewee, not enough time elapsed between answers for the question presented to have been the one asked, time strangely jumping forward and backward in general... some of the complaints are not so much that the editing's manipulative as the insult to the viewer's intelligence implied by how obvious it sometimes is.
</li></ul></li><li> One infamous example is from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fahrenheit911" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fahrenheit911">Fahrenheit 9/11</a></em> where Moore is trying to prove a point about how callous politicians are in sending soldiers off to war. He approaches a Congressman outside Capitol Hill and asks if the man would willingly send his son to Iraq. The man stands mutely for a couple seconds before the camera cuts...to hide the fact that the Congressman answered that he has a nephew who's currently serving in Iraq.
</li></ul></li><li> The documentary <em>Teenage Tourette Camp</em> focused intently on a fight between two girls, apparently editing out clips of them getting along. The editors also, very obviously at times, edited the footage to make it look as though a person was spewing out a succession of tics that probably happened over several minutes. Not to mention that half of the tics shown were the rare ones of involuntary swearing.
</li><li> In Helmut Dietl's <em>Late Show</em>, a sleazy reporter photoshops two unrelated pictures (of the wife of a radio talkmaster-turned-late-night TV talk host, who had a riding accident, and his Porsche which was wrecked, but by someone else for completely different reasons). Justified in that he makes this story up for the German tabloids, where truth is optional. (Nowadays the photo would look <em>so</em> 'shopped, but keep in mind the movie is from 1999. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a>.)
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSheep1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSheep1996">Black Sheep (1996)</a></em>, the corrupt incumbent governor sends some thugs to burn down the children's activity center that her rival's brother Mike works in. Mike showed up moments later and tried, unsuccessfully, to put the fire out. A slimy photographer caught the whole thing, went to the governor and offered to sell her the ones of Mike in front of the burning building by himself.
<ul><li> Earlier in the film, the same photographer saw Mike intervening with bunch of teenagers drinking and smoking pot in an alley. He got pictures of Mike holding a joint and a bottle of liquor, surrounded by stoned kids, and sold them to the newspapers, without bothering to mention that Mike only took them to throw them away.
</li></ul></li><li> In Chris Maker's film <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tN1XWKULjfQ">Letters from Siberia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, he showed the difference a voiceover could make by using the exact same footage of a Soviet town three times, making the first an absurdly patriotic advertisement for the USSR, the second making it a fascist nightmare, and a final, more neutral commentary on the scenes.
</li><li> Here's a rare case of manipulative editing portraying the subjects in a more <em>positive</em> light: in <em>Morgan Spurlock</em>'s documentary <em>Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope</em>, one of the storylines follows James Darling, who plans to propose to his girlfriend Se Young at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KevinSmith">Kevin Smith</a> panel. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMACaJSQ4bc">This video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows how the proposal went down. In the film, James' question about Kevin Smith's fleshlight and Se Young mentioning that she's "had sex with a lot of people" were edited out, presumably to make the moment appear more romantic and less awkward.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaPoLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShaPoLang">Sha Po Lang</a></em>: Editing is used to frame crime boss Wong Po, by making it look like Wong had killed one of his own men with a shovel.
</li><li> This serves as a plot point in the romantic comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentySevenDresses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentySevenDresses">27 Dresses</a>.</em> Jane, as her sister Tess's maid of honor, is tasked with creating a slide show for her rehearsal dinner. Unfortunately, Tess is marrying Jane's boss, George, who Jane has secretly loved for years; to make matters worse, Tess has lied to him in an effort to impress him (including saying she loves animals and is a vegetarian and virgin). Jane writes a moving speech for the slide show...which is filled with images of Tess being mean to a cat, eating barbecue ribs, and making out with other guys. The wedding is called off—but surprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">Jane's friends chew her out for being such a jerk and publicly humiliating Tess</a>, instead of being open about her feelings.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrDeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrDeeds">Mr. Deeds</a></em>, Deeds rescues a woman and all her cats from a burning building. The next morning, he watches the news and is dismayed to find the news footage has been altered to make it look like he killed the cats and then forced himself on the woman.
</li><li> Crucial to the plot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBroadcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastBroadcast">The Last Broadcast</a></em>.
</li><li> The 2002 French mockumentary <em>Opération Lune</em>, also released with an English-language narration as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DarkSideOfTheMoon">Dark Side of the Moon</a></em>, was created to demonstrate how documentaries can slant their subject using techniques such as manipulative editing. It includes interviews with luminaries including Henry Kissinger, Donald Rumsfeld, and Buzz Aldrin, who are made to appear as if they are talking about the entirely fictional conspiracy that the film purports to be documenting.
</li><li> French movie <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesRipoux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LesRipoux">Les Ripoux</a></em> was shown in Soviet Union with several minutes cut out at the end, completely changing the tone. Specifically, Soviet version of the movie ends with main character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being released from prison and realizing nobody is there to meet him</span>, while in the original <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after a few seconds his old partner arrives and gives him his fair share of the profits of the crime.</span> Soviet censors had trouble with a crook getting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a happy ending</span>.
</li><li> The ending credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JemAndTheHolograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JemAndTheHolograms">Jem and the Holograms</a></em> featured clips of real fans allegedly talking about what they loved about the movie, but said fans were actually asked what they thought of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">the original 80's cartoon</a></em> and the clips were edited and spliced with movie scenes to give the impression they loved the film instead. Naturally fans were <em>not</em> amused by such a shallow trick to give the movie props and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNostalgiaCritic">The Nostalgia Critic</a></em> went off on a rant about this in his review, likening it to an outright betrayal of their fanbase.
</li><li> In the horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnfriendedDarkWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UnfriendedDarkWeb">Unfriended: Dark Web</a></em>, the group of hackers use edited clips of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">AJ's videos to call the police with, suggesting that he plans on undergoing a murder spree in a mall</span>. This ends up with the police swarming the house, and leads into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">AJ's death</span>.
</li><li> Most of the trailers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hercules">Hercules</a></em> take certain lines out of context and dub them over completely different scenes. For example, the end of the original teaser trailer makes it look like Meg sings "Yes indeed!" at the end of "Zero to Hero," when actually it's one of the Muses, and a later theatrical trailer shows the adult Hercules seemingly praying to the statue of Zeus and asking how to become a true hero, when actually that prayer and question are uttered by Young Hercules the first time he visits the temple and the clips of his older self talking to the statue are from a much later scene, and makes it like Hades is calling Hercules "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming">Jerkules</a>", when it was another person whose voice is used.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManFarFromHome">Spider-Man: Far From Home</a></em>, the post-credits scene includes a news broadcast in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">footage that Mysterio has captured seconds before his death has been edited to frame Spider-Man for killing him and make Spider-Man appear villainous</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BroadcastNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BroadcastNews">Broadcast News</a></em>, Tom is interviewing a woman with a single camera setup. When they turn the camera around for his reaction shots, he make his eye tear so it looks like her story made him cry. It actually almost did, but he wouldn't have been on camera when he had.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanForever">Batman Forever</a></em>: Edward Nygma, the future Riddler, murders Fred Stickley by throwing him out a window.

<ul><li> Referenced in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenElton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenElton">Ben Elton</a> novel <em>Dead Famous</em>  to draw in ratings for her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em>-esque reality show, the producer creates a mock lesbian scene between two contestants (running an unrelated dialogue about finding head massage sensual over footage of one of the women washing the other's hair) and tries to make another contestant look unpopular by splicing together sound clips to have her say that she hates the other housemates.
<ul><li> In the same book, this very same technique also runs the risk of backfiring badly on the producers; one of the housemates is an insufferable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup">animal-rights activist</a> who proceeds to drive the other contestants mad with his <em>very</em> poor hygiene (he believes that, since fleas are living creatures, it's immoral to kill them  and soon the entire house is infected) and hypocritical self-righteousness. However, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">the audience likes him</a> his appearances are edited to present him in the best possible light while the others are unfairly made to look like bullies, with the result that much to everyone's horror he gets kept on. However, the other contestants immediately catch on to what's happened and call the producers out on what they've had to suffer through with regards to him and the obvious skewing they've been doing, threatening to walk off the project and leaving the producer with the choice of either getting rid of the activist or having him be the <em>only</em> contestant. Fortunately for her, he once bashed in a girl's head on a protest march and the police soon come a-calling...
</li><li> It also features the rarely-seen aftermath of such skewering; the first contestant to get kicked off the show finds that everyone on the outside hates her thanks to the way she was depicted and she's basically trapped in a life as a scorned joke. While she is shown to be a bit obnoxious in the house, she's no worse than the other housemates, and is understandably bitter about the whole thing as a result.

The one exception is in the finals, where instead it's the top two teams (Seasons 7 and 16 were especially bad, as the top two teams finished, respectively, 45 and 25 minutes apart).
</li><li> Contestants auditioning for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em> don't go directly to the celebrity judge panel; they first sing for staffers who try to sort people into "maybe good enough to be on the show", "not good enough to be on the show", and "so terrible it'll be funny". Former contestants have alleged that the producers spliced together footage of their initial screening by the staffers so as it make it appear that they were singing in front of Randy, Simon, and Paula. This apparently happens frequently if a contestant sings badly for the show's staffers and is put through to the judges as a "joke contestant", but then pulls it together and gives a significantly better performance before the judges. The producers simply edit things to make it appear that the "so bad it's funny" attempt was done before the judges, and the contestant's mildly-mediocre performance before the judges is never seen by viewers at home. This seems to explain instances where contestants appeared to give horrible performances that should have elicited scathing comments from Simon, but were dismissed with a much milder "sorry, it's just not good enough" comment.
<ul><li> The show facilitates this by encouraging the contestants to wear the same outfit to every audition. At least until Season 9, where the wording was changed to be a bit softer, but it was still stressed verbally. However, the editing can still be spotted through a simple tactic: look at what jewelry the contestant is wearing and how their hair is done when they talk to Seacrest outside, versus what they're wearing when they're singing. Because most kids will remember what dress/shirt they wore, but won't remember what jewelry they had on.
</li><li> There are also reports of the producers asking contestants to sing a different song that they aren't prepared for during the initial audition screening and recording the results, which invariably sounds terrible because the contestant hasn't practiced the song and/or doesn't even know all the words. The producers then edit this footage in with shots of the contestant walking in and out of the judging room so that they appear to have been badly botching the audition in front of the judges, when in fact during their actual appearance before the judges they sang a completely different song.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasGotTalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericasGotTalent">America's Got Talent</a></em> features a segment during the elimination rounds where all the competing rappers essentially trash talk Granny G and Burton Crane (two elderly contestants who both auditioned with a rap) behind their backs. While their harsh comments appear to be genuine, there's a particularly jarring shot of one rapper seemingly watching Granny G from the back with an annoyed glance. If you look close enough, you'll see that Granny was actually <em>chroma keyed into the shot</em>.

<ul><li> Used in the episode "The Illusion Of Truth". The editing makes it look as if Sheridan is hiding plans to replace humans with aliens (They <em>were</em> hiding things from the news crew, but it was something completely different). Far more subtle is his apparently live, unedited interview with a psychologist, where the reporter uses leading questions and careful phrasing to plant the idea in the viewers head that Sheridan is suffering from a version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a> (though it was accidentally called Helsinki Symdrome).

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> would often do this, since it's an abridged live-feeds show. Examples of this include:
<ul><li> Jeff's homophobic comments and outbursts are essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a> - the way you see him on the show, you'd think he's a perpetually nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a>.

The editors have taken a couple cues from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> editors and have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">made sure that the show revolves all around the editors' favourites and the eight guest stars known as the "newbies" as well.</a> Did you know Porsche and Lawon were even <em>in</em> the house? Did you even know Kalia was in the house until week four? Well, if you forgot about Porsche, you're not alone - the editors seemed to have forgotten about her too, until she appeared out of virtually <em>nowhere</em>.
</li><li> People who watched the feeds can tell you a different story on what happened at week 5. <em>Shelly</em> approached Kalia with the idea to backdoor Porsche so that Jeff, Jordan, and Rachel would forgive Kalia and it would get her further in the game. Then that's when Daniele got upset with Kalia in the HOH room in that last part of the episode. However, the editors made it seem like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Rachel</a></em>, one of the Producers' Pets, did all the work and gave Shelly no credit whatsoever. It makes it look like Shelly and the other newbies are complete <em>idiots</em>. This got incredibly weird <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">later in the series, when Kalia and Daniele mention Shelly coming up with that idea</a>.
</li><li> In season 8, Jessica appears to be saying something rude about Carol when she was evicted. In actuality, that wasn't her goodbye message. They didn't even play it because it was "Too nice".
</li></ul></li><li> A 1999 episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBill">The Bill</a></em> featured the police officer characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">being filmed by a documentary crew</a> ala <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cops">COPS</a></em>. This practice was cleverly referenced in the plot itself  one of the production crew blackmails Detective Sergeant John Bolton by claiming she can manipulate the editing, and portray him in a negative light by making it look like he lost a murder weapon during a raid on a flat. Ultimately this is turned the other way, as the weapon was eventually recovered, and the TV team then went back and filmed some close-up shots of it in its original location so they could re-edit the footage of the original raid and make it look like the weapon was recovered in the first place.

</div></li><li> A rare inverted example appears in a special "Revisited" episode of <em>Bridezillas</em>. During an interview with past couple Mark and Deb, Mark claims that the editors manipulated the footage to make it look like Deb was texting her ex-husband<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xzsu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xzsu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xzsu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><strong>Not</strong> for unfaithful reasons, in case you were wondering</span>.

</div></li><li> The trope is referenced in <em>Britain's Got The Pop Factor And Possibly A New Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly On Ice</em>, where the viewer is teased before the break with Geraldine giving an interview in a bad mood. In the actual interview, it turns out she was in a perfectly good mood and she was merely quoting that R Wayne was fed up with this trope.
</li><li> In the Season 4 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceMoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceMoms">Dance Moms</a></em>, Abby and Christi break out into what would be their last heated argument over the latter's daughter Chloe. When Abby's back is turned to the camera as she walks away, her voice is heard saying that Chloe is "washed up" and Christi goes ballistic. Later, Chloe tearfully tells her mother that she "heard what Abby said" and they leave the show for good. After the episode taped, Christi said in a now-deleted series of tweets that Abby "made fun of Chloes appearance caused by a health issue" and that her comment would likely "be edited to protect her". Once the episode aired, fans quickly discovered that Abby's final comments to Christi were spliced together from a different episode where Abby was arguing with her main rival Cathy and that Abby's insensitive remark was made less harsh both in order to protect Abby (as Christi predicted) and to make it look like Christi flipped out over nothing.
<div class="indent"> <em>(Abby's edited comment to Christi)</em> Chloe is <strong>finished</strong>! Your kid's <strong>washed up</strong>.
</div><div class="indent"> <em>(Abby to Cathy in a different episode)</em> Cathy! You're <strong>finished</strong>! You're <strong>washed up</strong>, you're old, you're nothing!
</div><ul><li> The mothers have also stated at fan events that their reactions to Abby are often taken from harsher situations to make it look like they're flipping out over something petty. At one meet-and-greet, Kelly Hyland, who had two daughters on the show, said the following regarding manipulative editing:
<div class="indent"> "The bad stuff that Abby does, they take our reactions, the moms' reactions, like... her throwing a chair at Paige. Obviously, any mother is going to flip out like, 'You just threw a chair at my kid', right? But then they'll take that reaction that I gave to something bad like that and use it towards Abby saying 'Oh, Paige, you didn't point your feet' and that's so not what I was flipping out about. Like, I'm watching the show on Tuesday night thinking... I just want to like, hop on the screen and tell everybody 'That's not how it happened! I'm not really that psycho!'"
</div></li></ul></li><li> The Green Beret and Spetsnaz representatives of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadliestWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadliestWarrior">Deadliest Warrior</a></em> reveal in the comments section of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.spike.com/video/aftermath-green/3171579">The Aftermath - Green Beret vs. Spetsnaz<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that some level of Manipulative Editing is done to make both parties seem more confrontational to each other. For example, a finger gesture directed at the director for joking about the Spetsnaz was edited so that it looked like the Spetsnaz was flipping off the Green Beret as they were walking in.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorInTheHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorInTheHouse">Doctor in the House</a></em> episode "Doctor on the Box", the medical students at St. Swithin's Hospital are being interviewed for a documentary, and the director also films a few scenes of choreographed revelry at the bar. In one scene, one of the students says the popular perception of medical students is that they spend all their time "boozing, playing rugger, chasing nurses," whereas they actually spend "hardly any time at all" doing those things. When the documentary airs, the footage is edited to portray the students as drunken, skirt-chasing clowns, and the interviewee now appears to be claiming that students <em>do</em> spend all their time "boozing, playing rugger, chasing nurses," leaving "hardly any time at all" for the work they are supposed to be doing on taxpayers' money.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EstateOfPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EstateOfPanic">Estate of Panic</a></em>: On any given episode, you can hear sound bites of some of the contestants' interjections five or six times over the course of the show. One show in particular had a 10-second long or so sound bite of <em>a contestant from another episode</em> screaming repeatedly.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em> had Robert and Ray tasked with creating a tribute video for Frank. They decide to interview his lodge brothers, but get only negative comments and complaints. Ray then hits on the idea of asking the men how they feel about chocolate; the pair then clumsily edit the video to cut between the lodge brothers saying "Frank Barone" and then positive remarks about the dessert. Frank notices something is up when the video includes people talking about how much they'd like to eat him.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">The Good Wife</a></em>, Cary Agos is charged with conspiracy to transport narcotics based on a recording of him telling some members of Lemond Bishop's drug ring how to evade detection, taken by a CI. However the CI had conveniently left out the part where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConversationalTroping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConversationalTroping">they were all clearly talking about fictional drug dealers in the movies</a>.
</li><li> The promos for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellsKitchen">Hell's Kitchen</a></em> make liberal use of cherrypicking to add drama. In Season 4, one episode saw Matt accidentally cut the tip off his thumb during the challenge, and food critics showing up for dinner service; the promos made it look like the events were one and the same, implying that the severed portion of Matt's thumb ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">on the critic's plate</a>.
<ul><li> And again in Season 5, where the women's team slips while carrying a cow carcass into the kitchen and briefly panics when they see blood, learning to their relief that it just came from the meat. Guess which part wasn't shown in the promos?
</li><li> The show doesn't even bother trying to hide that they are editing previews of the next episode and are much easier to spot. Season 6 had a preview of the chefs being woken up in the middle of the night and being told there's a fire and firetrucks show up. The reality? There's no fire at all and Ramsay just woke up the chefs so they can serve food to a bunch of firefighters for the next challenge. Season 7 showed two contestants seemingly getting romantic in one scene, then Ramsay saying "I am going to do something I have never done before" as if he was going to make them choose between the relationship or the trip to London as part of the prize everyone wanted. The end result? Ramsay's statement was just based on him doing something different for the next challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHills">The Hills</a></em> has been repeatedly alleged as being almost entirely scripted/manipulated in the editing process, to such an extent that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> themselves admitted after the series finale that "maybe the term 'reality TV' didn't perfectly apply" to the show. Some cast members have stated after the fact that nearly everything was either exaggerated or faked for the cameras:
<ul><li> In general, many of the recaps that air prior to episodes use lines and shots that don't line up with what happened before, and often recut the lines being said to reframe that week's major problem or issue.
</li><li> Tabloid reports produced during the show's lifespan showed images of reporters and fans staked out around lead cast member Lauren Conrad's house. Within the context of the series, however, establishing shots of her apartment show her in what appears to be a quiet, sleepy corner of the city, with virtually no one in sight and no trace of the paparazzi camped out there. This is a common trick in reality shows — by necessity, reality shows often use a different residence from the one where the cast are actually living, often due to concerns over anonymity or portraying their lifestyle in a different way.
</li><li> Cast member Audrina Patridge ran a blog that posted during and after the show's lifespan, and has said in past posts that she was cast by a producer in the role of Lauren and Heidi's friend. As such, the information gleaned in the pilot episode (that Audrina just happened to be friends with Lauren and Heidi prior to the events of the series) is completely false.
</li><li> Years after the show ended, Spencer Pratt stated that his and Heidi's "elopement" to Mexico to get married in the second season was "largely symbolic", and likely never happened. In actuality (and found out by the Associated Press after the fact), the two wedded in a civil ceremony after-hours near an office park, with no cameras present.
</li><li> Lauren has stated outright that she was not on the end of Spencer's "I'm sorry" phone call in the fifth season.
</li><li> The season five finale has Lauren present at Spencer and Heidi's wedding, only to slip out unnoticed after the ceremony due to her feelings over the event and life in general... <a class="urllink" href="https://www.glamour.com/story/7-storylines-on-the-hills-that-were-actually-totally-fake">except in actuality<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, she was locked in basement of the church for several hours under guard, even though she had somewhere to be, and the wedding was beset with a power outage that stalled the proceedings for several hours.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.realitytea.com/2011/02/16/kristin-cavallari-admits-almost-all-of-the-hills-was-scripted/">According to Kristin Cavalieri<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (the lead character of the fifth and final season), "almost all of" the season was scripted, to such an extent that she only showed up to film scenes three days out of every week, and that her real friends and job were kept away from MTV. Additionally, she has stated that her relationship with fellow cast member Justin was faked, and that the producers asked her to text him to have him show up for scenes, even when he didn't want to.
</li><li> The show itself invoked this in its final scene. After Kristin and Brody part ways for the final time, Brody walks away — and it's revealed that the entire area he's standing in is a set, with decorations and even the Hollywood sign itself being seen as props carted away by crew members. Allegedly, this was done by MTV in response to allegations about the show's manipulative filming process.

</div><ul><li> There was also some Manipulative Editing done for the previews. In one episode, the preview showed them entering the house of a patient who was a hoarder. The preview ends with a cut after they lift up a blanket and see a pair of legs underneath, heavily implying it to be a dead body. However, in the episode, the "Dead body" was actually the patient's wife who was hiding.

It begins with Jonathan's boss, magician Adam Klaus, filming a segment for a TV show in which he approaches a member of the public and predicts the number they will tell him by revealing it under his shirt. Of course, he's had the number "36" tattooed on there in advance, which prompts a long afternoon filming him stopping random passers-by in the street, asking them a number, and getting increasingly frustrated when they give him every number but "36" (or, in the case of one guy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">punching him for no reason</a>). Later, when they've finally found someone to give him the right number and are editing it together, Adam remarks that he doesn't remember the woman laughing so much when he makes the big reveal; Jonathan takes rather malicious pleasure in telling him that this is a bit where she was <em>actually</em> laughing at him stepping in some dogshit in the street, and they've spliced it in.

The lawyer is professional and states he cannot help her at the moment but suggests another lawyer. When the team convinces the mark he has accidentially killed a woman, they intercept his call to the aforementioned lawyer making the "lawyer" tell the mark he is in Japan and cannot help. He is giving the name of a friend to help, a role to be played by another member of the crew, to get the mark to give up information he was holding back on about a powerful underworld figure the team is after.
</li><li> In "The Toy Job" the team needs to make it look like a popular teen actress is suppoting their toy to use her influence among her fans to drive up market on the toy. Rather than try and fake a recording, they have Parker slip the toy into her tote so it can be seen, have Sophie distract her and then compliment her, making the actress smile and laugh, and Hardison captures the "happy actress with her new hot toy" on camera and release those photos to the internet.

</div></li><li> This caused a major problem for ACN in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewsroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNewsroom">The Newsroom</a></em> after they air a news story that they discover was doctored, forcing them to retract a falsified, high-profile story about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> American troops using sarin gas on foreign soil</span>. As a result, the several characters are threatened with losing their jobs for not spotting the fabrication <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the one who <em>did</em> edit the video was fired</span>, showing why you <em>do not</em> edit high-profile news stories.
</li><li> This was parodied in an episode of British sketch comedy <em>Not The Nine O'clock News</em>, featuring the tape of a suspect "confessing" his crime to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFashionedCopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFashionedCopper">Old-Fashioned Copper</a>  the camera makes obvious cuts every few words, the clock on the back wall jumps around, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">hideous bruises appear and disappear from his face</a>.
</li><li> In the Christmas episodes of the British version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK">The Office</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyHairedBoss">Pointy-Haired Boss</a> David Brent — who has fallen on hard times after losing his job and failing to jumpstart a media career on the back of his appearances in the show, which has shown him to be largely a jerk — argues that the film crew who followed him and his employees around 'stitched him up' by doing this, presenting a top-heavy depiction of the moments that made him look like a clown (which, to be fair, there were lots of) and not showing enough of the moments where he actually <em>did</em> do a good job and / or managed to charm people. Interestingly, the Christmas episodes go some way towards rectifying this, showing him in a more charming, competent light, as if the documentary makers felt bad about this and were trying to make it up to him.
</li><li> One of the season finales of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OtherSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OtherSpace">Other Space</a></em> plays this in-universe: the crew realizes the entire ship has been fitted with omnipresent microscopic cameras and the resulting footage has been edited into a highly manipulative trailer of their time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/OurMissBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/OurMissBrooks">Our Miss Brooks</a></em>: In "Public Speakers Nightmare" and "The Tape Recorder", innocuous recordings are accidentally misplayed to produce Miss Brooks saying scandalous things about Mr. Conklin, and Mr. Conklin insulting Mr. Stone, Head of the Board of Education. These recordings, incidentally, are played in front of Mr. Stone . . . .
</li><li> In one episode of the short-lived series <em>Over There</em>, a reporter is embedded with the squad the show follows. After they get into a shoot-out with insurgents, the reporter's video makes it look like the squad's heavy gunner was shooting blindly - spraying and praying - and killed several non-combatants. At the end of the episode, after he's been chewed out by his CO, the gunner confronts the reporter, who tries to brush him before finally admitting that <em>his bosses</em> cut the video to make a "normal" shoot-out into something newsworthy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RowanAndMartinsLaughIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RowanAndMartinsLaughIn">Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In</a></em> did a skit a few times that <em>pretended</em> to be this. They'd interview some celebrity (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a>) and then announce "Now we'll show you what could be done by unscrupulous editing of this interview." The modified version had Wayne saying of critics "They can kiss my Levis!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace">RuPaul's Drag Race</a></em> has what fans have called the "Bitch Edit," when a queen becomes the "villain" of the season by making all their lines and actions come off as completely dickish, even though most of the time they A) were asked for their opinion and simply gave an honest answer, B) were responding to a bitchy comment one of the "good" queens made, or C) apologized afterwards. These little details are always conveniently edited out, requiring the queens to explain on social media how things really went down. However, Season 5 "villain" Roxxxy Andrews deserves credit for not blaming the editing for her behavior. She says that the editors may manipulate, but they don't make things up; the bitchy comments that got aired are still things she said, and even though she apologized, saying "sorry" doesn't undo the initial hurt she caused. This was her reason for seeking "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">Rudemption</a>" in <em>All-Stars 2</em>. On the other side of the spectrum there's Phi Phi O'Hara, the "bitch" of Season 4, who has accused the show of grossly abusing the manipulative edit when she returned for <em>All-Stars 2</em>. She claims that when the season wasn't providing a suitable villain for drama, the producers took her out of context and harshly edited her. RuPaul denied these claims, but some of her fellow contestants backed up at least some of them.
</li><li> Again with professional wrestling, the reality show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em>, focusing on a handful of the WWE's female wrestlers, engages in a healthy bit of this that's easily obvious to knowledgeable wrestling fans. One of the most common is showing clips with the caption "Live on Raw" when it's clear that it's actually clips taken from one of the company's B-Shows, <em>Superstars</em> or <em>Main Event</em>, which are taped before <em>Raw</em>, but aired later in the week. This is slightly justified, though. <em>Total Divas</em> airs on the E! network, a channel devoted to pop culture and entertainment. As such, its audience is more concerned with the soapy drama and likely don't know (or really care) about the inner workings of the WWE. Paring down the distracting details helps to cut down on confusion and make it easier for non-wrestling fans to get into the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFactor">X Factor</a></em> finalist Rhydian Roberts was a victim of manipulative editing during the audition shows, thanks to the editors' attempts to make him the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pantomime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pantomime">Pantomime</a> villain.

Stewart explains that he was asked to pretape his speech about Katrina so the censors could check it over. The speech has been obviously chopped up (and dubbed over, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">fast-forwarded</a>) and he ends up accusing officials of being "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in</span>competent, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">un</span>acceptable, and shockingly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in</span>ept".

A recent WWE example was in the videos used to hype Triple H vs. Randy Orton for Wrestlemania 25. In the part that made reference to HHH and Stephanie McMahon being married, they used wedding footage with Stephanie and a guy with long blond hair (presumably HHH, only seen from the back). However, that man was actually Andrew "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Test" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Test">Test</a>" Martin and the footage was from their "wedding" on <em>Raw</em> in late 1999 that HHH interrupted. Surreal when you consider that Test died not too long ago.

The first was pretty harmless and Mick said "that looked like a lot of fun...but I suspect you've got something else to show me too." They then showed him a much more brutal match. He said that he actually grew nauseous and asked the tape to stop before it was completed, then condemned the second video as unsafe and unprofessional, saying that he would never recommend anybody go this route in pursuit of a professional wrestling career (ironic given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarbageWrestler">his background</a>, but at least he had a solid education in the basics). When the show aired, they broadcast footage of the second match followed by Mick's reaction to the first match.

His employees gave fairly positive responses when queried on whether he was a good boss, but they would be edited to remove the positive aspects; one employee stated that he's usually good, but occasionally "he's a tosser"...but the edited version simply said "he's a tosser".
</li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadRingers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DeadRingers">Dead Ringers</a></em> with a sketch based on the health show <em>You Are What You Eat</em> (the name is changed to <em>You Are What We Edit</em>).

Besides plenty of manipulative editing, they manipulated actual <em>events</em>  they staged a scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneMeetsEveryone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneMeetsEveryone">three out of the four band members reunited</a> (even though the three of them had driven to the site together), and had the host wait outside for Harland even though the producers and the other band members knew well ahead of time that he had decided not to do an interview.
</li><li> Actually done on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em> a lot:
<ul><li> The several trailers for <em>Samoa</em> made it seem like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Russell</a> was being targeted for elimination. The episode itself showed no such talk of elimination. The focus on Russell is actually discussed <a class="urllink" href="http://funny115.com/v2/2.htm">in this column<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; the writer, an acclaimed Survivor columnist and possibly the foremost expert on the show, points out how Russell's many, <em>many</em> mistakes in the <em>Heroes vs Villains</em> season were either a) buried by the editors, or b) made to look like really good moves. As he puts it at one point:
</li></ul><div class="indent">"In the episode they say that Russell planted a "Russell Seed" in Tyson's head, and that that got Tyson to switch his vote. But that's complete B.S. Remember, the episodes also claim that Russell impregnated Helen of Troy and started the Trojan War. If you'd like to know how badly the producers fudged this to make it look like Russell had anything to do with it, go read Tyson's post game interviews. Tyson thought he was being tricky and he essentially voted himself out."
</div><ul><li> In the first show of one season, Courtney Yates was made to look like more of a villainess than she really was when Stephanie Lagrossa's shoulder was dislocated in a challenge. She didn't <em>seriously</em> yell at her teammates to "break her shoulder", she actually said that <em>after</em> Stephanie's shoulder was dislocated and was intended as a joke. But when it's said <em>before</em> it happens? Sounds an awful lot like an order, doesn't it?
</li><li> In <em>Australian Outback</em>, one person was edited to look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Lazy Bum</a>. Months later, his fellow tribemates immediately leaped to his defense. In "Back from the Outback," the former of two "Back from" editions that addressed what the contestants had been up to since their return, an educator even went on to say that no one there ever graduated by being lazy.
</li><li> Most of tribal council is omitted due to time constraints.
</li><li> It's assumed that Purple Kelly on <em>Nicaragua</em> was intentionally edited to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> as revenge by the producers for quitting. Naonka at least had a lot of stuff to create drama and that impacted the game so she couldn't have been as edited out as Purple Kelly was.
</li><li> Hell, THE ENTIRE SHOW might fall under this trope. The great bulk of footage for Survivor has never been released. While the show isn't "staged" or anything like that (it legally can't be), this leaves room for a viewer to cry Manipulative Editing for practically any scene in any episode. <br/><br/>They especially do this to make a "story". In <em>Redemption Island</em>, 90% of the cast appeared to have been edited into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingProp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingProp">animated dummies</a> while the editors, who were <em>obviously</em> hardcore Boston Rob fans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">made sure the audience never forgot how much they loved him</a>, as well as Matt and Phillip. The hardest hit was Kristina, who found the idol in episode one, was voted out and eliminated third and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">never mentioned again</a></em>. The plan to eliminate Russell was actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Sarita's idea</a></em>; we didn't even see her until Dave was arguing with her. Dave was supposed to be a really good competitor, yet all the time we got to really see him compete was when he lost, and the other footage that existed of him was just him fighting with Sarita. Did you also know that Russell and his alliance actually <em>took rice</em> while everyone else was fishing?
</li><li> In <em>Thailand</em> and <em>Africa</em>, when Jeff comes back to read the votes for who won the million dollars, it's actually a quick cut to the reunion...with the stage diguised as the tribal council area, making it at first look like Jeff was revealing the votes right there. You can actually catch this in <em>Thailand</em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">finalist Clay seems to suddenly gain about 10-20 pounds in between the time where Jeff tallied the votes and then came back to reveal them.</a>
</li><li> Most often, they actually do this to have a bit of fun. One of the most famous of these incidents is in <em>Micronesia</em>. Episode two, Kathy asks who they're voting out and Joel tells her "Mary". Kathy asks, "Who?". The next episode, Jeff announces that Mary was voted out, and Eliza says, "Mary?!". It looks like they have no idea who they're actually playing the game with. In actuality, Kathy was asking for clarification and Eliza was expressing shock at how it was <em>her</em> that was voted out and not Chet. Of course they knew who Mary was; but it was still pretty funny regardless.
</li><li> In Tocantins, Coach was portrayed as this lying crazy guy who was always making up weird crap. In reality he is an incredibly nice, if offbeat, guy. Each week after an episode aired he would answer questions about what really happened, rather than what it was edited to look like. Many times, they actually ignored how he was joking or was just putting on a show for everyone else. Coach seems very aware of this; and in <em>Heroes vs. Villains</em> and <em>South Pacific</em>, he acts almost <em>nothing</em> like it.
</li><li> Lex in <em>All-Stars</em> was shown having an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> face after Kathy decides she's going to keep her immunity necklace. According to Lex post-game, he knew Kathy was going to keep it and even <em>encouraged</em> her to do so, but the transition from Kathy saying "I'm going to keep it" to Lex's look of sheer terror was - story-wise - a fitting conclusion to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> that Lex went through in his last episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieBrooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieBrooker">Charlie Brooker</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBwepkVurCI">discussed the phenomenon at length<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Screenwipe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Screenwipe">Screenwipe</a></em>. As an example, the show put together a mini-reality show which showed several sections played naturally and then strategically edited to present the participants in best or worst light  for example, a bit where Brooker cracks a self-admittedly lame joke which receives a moderately good-humoured response in reality, but is then strategically edited to appear as if it bombed.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>, this Trope gave Gibbs trouble in the Season 3 episode "Model Behavior" when reporters misrepresented him on camera  impressive given how little he said while storming through the press mob with a scowl on his face. The edited footage made it look like Gibbs cut an interview short when a reporter asked him if the military was doing something illegal and inappropriate. He had actually stormed away because the reporter had accidentally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustHaveCaffeine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustHaveCaffeine">spilled his coffee</a>.
</li><li> One example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars">Robot Wars</a></em> in an otherwise completely unremarkable fight between Chaos 2 and an otherwise unremarkable robot called Medusa 2000. A 15-minute battle in reality becomes a 5-minute battle where Medusa 2000 can't escape Chaos 2 at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParanormalState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParanormalState">Paranormal State</a></em> is apparently <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ghosttheory.com/2008/11/04/paranormal-state-caught-faking-entire-show">quite fond<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of editing footage for maximum drama.
</li><li> Even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueLife">True Life</a></em> is guilty of staging some scenes, though usually only so that they can get scenes that are important to the theme of the episode. For most folks with really extreme life circumstances, though, all they have to do is follow them around. Usually there isn't much actual editing or splicing of the tape, since it is supposed to be "True Life".
</li><li> Then-18-year-old pornographic actress Sasha Grey was openly unhappy about her interview on <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTyraBanksShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTyraBanksShow">The Tyra Banks Show</a></em>. Grey claims that she was forced to wear a deliberately girlish wardrobe that she was handed, made to wear blusher and tie her hair to appear more childlike, and that all her responses to Tyra's questions had been edited out, making her appear as if she had nothing to say in response to Tyra, and overly demonizing her and her line of work. At the end of that vlog entry, Grey also adds that Banks' wardrobe department had <em>stolen her earrings</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>: In "iFight Shelby Marx'', Nevel makes a fake video using a line from iCarly and manages to fool the teenage wrestler Shelby Marx into thinking that Carly deliberately pushed down her grandmother during a press conference when it was really an accident, leading to Shelby actually wanting to hurt Carly during the wrestling match they had organized to raise money for charity. In the end, Shelby and the iCarlies realize the deception and Carly, Sam, and Shelby give Nevel a brutal beating offscreen.
</li><li> Hilariously done on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em>, during the Electric Car challenge. The team attempt to edit the footage to make it look like their Epic Failure of a car, The Hammerhead Eagle i Thrust passed the safety tests. They wind up making some of the most obviously edited footage imaginable. "Tuokool!"
</li><li> Parodied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em> where several Hollywood Arts students are asked to star in a reality show. The producers splice together Tori's conversation with her grandmother with Beck ordering a pizza in a way that made it sound like the two were having an affair.
</li><li> This was shown in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em> where Earl helps out a reporter on his list by being the protagonist of a reportage about him and his family. What was a heart-warming interview went through incredible amounts of cherry-picking to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Randy look even more stupid</a> on purpose.
</li><li> Shown in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven">That's So Raven</a></em> when Raven and Chelsea were on a reality show together. The interviews were manipulated to make it look like the best friends really hated each other, in the hopes of starting an actual argument that could be filmed. For example, when Raven said Chelsea is a great friend and she would never want to lose her, it's edited to make it sound like she was saying Chelsea is a loser. The girls catch on and expose the scam.
</li><li> Invoked in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em>, where they showed a clip of Adam and Jamie solving Rubik's Cubes - Jamie while blindfolded, and Adam using his <em>feet</em>. They then revealed that they had actually filmed clips of themselves <em>scrambling</em> the cubes from a solved state and played it backwards, and had one of the researchers walk backwards across the room in the background to add verisimilitude.
<ul><li> Likewise, a lot of testing tends to get cut for time constraints; but normally these are just replicating the results, so it's rather justified.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StorageWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StorageWars">Storage Wars</a></em> shows Barry giving Dave a hat with his bidding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> (a loud, obnoxious "Yuuuuup!") on the front, so that he would shut up and point to the hat instead, with poor results. However, later that episode, Dave's employees show up to the locker he won with "Yuuuuup!" and a copyright mark on their T-shirts. Dave's hat already has a copyright mark on it as well.
</li><li> Done in-universe in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EvenStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EvenStevens">Even Stevens</a></em>. Ren's long-time rival <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Larry Beale</a> is running against her for class president. He goes over to her brother Louis and asks him some random questions, with his friends secretly recording the conversation with a videocamera. They then have Larry record a bunch of questions about Ren that make Louis' answers seem like he's insulting or making fun of her. Of course, nobody pays attention to the fact that Louis is clearly sitting in the cafeteria while Larry's background is completely different.
</li><li> Most seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoYouThinkYouCanDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoYouThinkYouCanDance">So You Think You Can Dance</a></em> are edited to make it look like the finalists are chosen at the end of "Vegas Week". In fact, not only are the final selections are made about a month after Vegas Week ends, but they are made in southern California; the set is made up to look like they are still in Vegas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodLuckCharlie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodLuckCharlie">Good Luck Charlie</a></em>: Jo tricks Gabe into letting her record footage of him claiming it'll help him in his campaign for class president, but edits the footage out of context to make him look bad.
</li><li> Used in-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>. One person on an in-universe version of <em>To Catch A Predator</em> met up with the girl just to tell her not to do this, to "take off your clothes and put something decent on", and to think more about who she meets on line. It was edited to make him seem like he was preying on her, with him saying "take off your clothes".
</li><li> Done in the pre-commercial promos/flashbacks from the intake parts of Rehab with Dr. Drew. When interviewing patients about past drug use he usually keeps a blank/concerned facial expression, probably to avoid them feeling judged. However in the promos, it showed them recounting an extreme drug history, but then panned to Dr. Drew's pained or shocked expressions, actually from his reactions to things they said when they were talking about their lives rather than their drug history.
</li><li> Parodied in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a>'s "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL56Ds239wLjPvZb64xN66rJgO_OeCLfq0">Alex Trebek Is Losing His Mind<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" segments, which plays clips of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> where the answers Trebek reads out are complete nonsense like "Despite a broken leg, Tobey Maguire nailed this Romanian girl with the over 300 year-old reticulated slither" and "This ugly guy, Will Smith (not the black one) can sometimes track down one of these Irish fairies, in this type of marriage." Eventually, Alex Trebek shows up during the skit <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B084LKO6ezI">and gets revenge by showing some clips from Conan's show edited in the same manner.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Some of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KingOfTheNerds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KingOfTheNerds">King of the Nerds</a></em> contestants have spoken about this. Danielle from the first season said that they showed the worst parts of her and made her come across as far worse than she actually is, and Nicole in the second season pointed out that, for the nerd-off votes in the episode where she was eliminated, it was edited to imply that she betrayed Zack and voted for him, even though she did not.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShakeItUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShakeItUp">Shake it Up</a></em> episode "Reality Check It Up" entirely revolves around this. Kind of makes sense given it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityShow">Reality Show</a>.
</li><li> Done for an entirely different purpose in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>. In order to get rid of a Columbian drug cartel enforcer who's harassing their client, Sam phones up the enforcer and asks several leading questions. Then the team cuts up the recording and pastes it back together in different order to make it sound like the enforcer wants to turn state's evidence so the cartel will get rid of him <em>for</em> them.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Sam:</strong> I've heard legitimate recordings that sounded a hell of a lot worse.
</div></li><li> In general, trailers and "Coming up" bumps are cut this way to increase interest, even if what was actually going on on the show was different. So even the edited show is edited. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FaceOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FaceOff">Face/Off</a></em> had one where the "coming up on Face-Off" showed Glenn saying "I do not like this" and an unhappy reaction shot. Once the episode actually came back...he was delivering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchComment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchComment">Bait-and-Switch Comment</a>. "I do not like this. I love it." Granted, the reaction shot was real, because Glenn paused long enough after "I do not like this" for the contestant to react.
</li><li> Sometimes done on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em> of all shows. If a cycle of turns goes around once without affecting the score (e.g., all three contestants consecutively call wrong letters, hit Lose a Turn, and/or hit Bankrupt when they have nothing to lose to it), then the cycle is usually cut out to save time. However, this can be more obvious than most  sometimes, a cycle that <em>does</em> affect proceedings is edited out, and cycles of three or more consecutive wrong letters in the Speed-Up round are typically masked by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpCut">Jump Cut</a> to the host.
<ul><li> In 2011, a video surfaced online titled "Most Awkward Wheel of Fortune Moment Ever" showing a contestant (obviously chroma keyed) calling an "N" followed by a shot of the puzzle board reading "CLAM _IGGER". After an awkwardly-long pause, Pat says "No N. Hmm..." as if he was expecting it to be there. The video went viral with many debating whether the clip was real or not. In actuality, the footage itself was taken from a then-recent rerun of a 2009 episode, with the letters on the board and onscreen category taken from other puzzles throughout the episode. Pat saying "No N." was actually from the beginning of a new puzzle, hence his "Hmm..." due to "N" being a common letter and a frequent first choice of contestants.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CHiPs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CHiPs">CHiPs</a></em> had a team of reporters travelling around harassing Ponch and Jon while they performed their duties. At one point, the lead reporter falls down and Ponch helps him back up. They also have a very harsh argument. Later, the team edits the argument to make it sound like he's threatening the reporter and they run the footage backwards to make it look like Ponch is knocking him down.
</li><li> Done, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/america-unearthed-guest-producers-misrepresented-me-lied-to-audience-about-facts">to many guest's consternation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericaUnearthed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericaUnearthed">America Unearthed</a></em>.

The Gestapo sets up a counterfeiting operation at Stalag 13, and the officer in charge confides to Klink that he (the officer) will be executed if it fails. Hogan and co. record the conversation and edit it to sound like the head counterfeiter will be killed once he's finished with his work, then play the doctored tape for him so he'll help them sabotage the operation.

</li><li> There is a particular species of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanVid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanVid">Fan Vid</a> which basically involves editing together scenes from a movie/TV show/game/whatever in order to make a fake trailer for it which portrays it as having a very different plot, such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain">gay love story</a>. Many also edit wholesome family movies to look like terrifying horror flicks, or vice versa. One would be <em>very</em> surprised at how much <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaryPoppins">Mary Poppins</a></em> looks like a movie where the nanny wants to terrify and kill the children with the right clips, or how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">The Shining</a></em> looks like a simple family comedy. There's even a trailer in which it's implied that in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em>, the title character goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> after the stepsisters ruin her dress...
<ul><li> There's a similar type of video which uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensoredForComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensoredForComedy">strategic censoring</a> to make characters <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Wd-Q3F8KM">such as Count Von Count<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> say... things that wouldn't appear in a kid's show.
<div class="indent">"Because I <em>really</em> love to ***!"
</div></li><li> Fanvids of the "clips from [insert show here] set to music" variety often do this when they aren't simply tributes to/retellings of canon events. This most commonly takes the form of haphazardly arranging scenes to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnE_ykEzSRg">fit the lyrics/rhythm of the chosen song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but more <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFFK0084EjI">elaborate edits<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can turn any story into any other story. By carefully selecting clips and songs, it's possible to turn heroes into villains and vice versa, create romance (including many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing">Crack Pairing</a>) and epic battles out of thin air, create death scenes for characters who are alive and well in canon, and make it look as if characters who have never met are interacting with each other (even when they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">from different works</a>). Via masking it's possible to place characters and objects <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU1LisZVDj0">into scenes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izkl2umQihQ">they weren't originally in<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or even make entirely new scenes out of pre-existing imagery, and minor changes to said imagery (such as changing a character's eye color) can sometimes be made on top of that, but those are optional; those techniques are also rarely used for anything other than 2D animation, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectFailure">technical issues</a> which tend to arise when they're used for other media.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop">YouTube Poop</a> videos are made of this. One of the most common techniques is to edit a character's dialogue so they end up saying something weird, dirty, or both. This practice is known as "Sentence Mixing" (where single words generally stay intact) and "Word Splicing" (where words are cut up, put together and somehow, it works). For example, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Bl2KyUbewI">Robotnik's Face is Politically Incorrect<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> changes Dr. Robotnik's line "I, the baron of badness, the knight of nastiosity, am on the brink of my greatest success!" to "I'm on the brink of incest!", and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-mF7Rttl9A">Gravity Faaf<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> turns an exchange about being co-captain into an exchange about cocaine (by cutting off the word "<strong>co-c</strong>aptain" so that it sounds like "coke").
<ul><li> Robotnik's memetic catchphrase in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/YouTubePoop">YouTube Poop</a>, "PINGAS!" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">which sounds like "penis"</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">to some ears</a>) is also an example: it comes from the phrase "snoo<strong>ping as</strong> usual, I see". It was discovered by Stegblob and first used in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23pXoyKBHd4">Robotnik Has a Viagra Overdose<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>. There's also its much less popular equivalents, such as "PINESS", from a line in <em>Sonic's Christmas Blast</em> where Robotnik says "Hap-PINESS is always so much more enjoyable..." Also "PIENDISH" and "PEINOUS" from "fiendish" and "heinous" respectively.
</li><li> Another very popular phrase comes from the intro to the Zelda CD-i game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCDiGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCDiGames">Link: Faces of Evil</a></em> where Link says "How about a kiss, <strong>f</strong>or l<strong>uck</strong>?"
</li><li> This is also part of the "THIS VIDEO WILL BE FLAGGED" fad, which involves editing a clip to make it sound like a character is doing or saying something dirty.
</li><li> The "I made this while doing <em>X</em>" meme also utilizes this, where a character's dialogue is used to form a song title followed by that song being played. The meme-maker was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkQDjWxaHoM">through_the_fire_and_flames.wmv<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A couple of enterprising (no pun intended!) fans edited the novelization of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrek2009">Star Trek (2009)</a></em> into <a class="urllink" href="http://vimeo.com/8338091">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (audio is EXTREMELY NSFW).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer">The Irate Gamer</a></em> is known to do this. In his review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em>, he <em>slows down</em> the footage.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KidIcarus">Kid Icarus</a></em> review, he claims that Uranos shows up as early as the Underworld fortress, when it only appears in Skyworld. He also "shows" that the Snowmen enemies are named "Snowball Flinging Assholes" in the instruction manual.
</li><li> As a joke in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckHunt">Duck Hunt</a> review, he shows himself on level <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast">666</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAngryVideoGameNerd">The Angry Video Game Nerd</a> also does this, since he can't show us his <em>entire</em> run of the game without causing the video to go on forever. If you keep a careful eye on the score, timer, or health bar in any game, you'll see he does this <em>very</em> frequently for the sake of humor, emphasizing a point, or simplification. One of the most arrant examples of this is in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Castlevania64">Castlevania 64</a></em> review. He says that the music sucks because there is no music and proves it by showing one of the stages where there isn't music. This becomes quite odd and contributes to the research failures, since he later on shows where he got stuck at...and you can <em>clearly hear</em> background music.
<ul><li> He also claims that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCDiGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaCDiGames">Zelda's Adventure</a></em> doesn't have any music; when the game actually does and only shows parts of the game that don't have music. However; this could likely be a result of him not getting far enough into the game since he also states that the game will not save for him.
</li><li> He even shows off some of his editing tricks in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfnSqLzUzfM">The Making of an AVGN Episode<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, particularly how he needs to carefully splice moments together to keep the melody of the music from jumping around. He sometimes even makes a lengthy recording of the stage music and lays it over his cuts to hide his edits, and only refrains from doing this often due to the amount of effort required to do it.

The "real" story is about a normal couple where the husband accidentally killed his wife when he tried to perform a "donkey punch" on her while they were having passionate sex in the kitchen. <em>Raw Justice</em>'s version turns it into an oversensationalized crime story about a "coital boogeyman" who held his wife captive for years as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> before finally and coldly committing premeditated murder.

In reality, the judges are much less harsh towards contestants on the <em>Junior</em> series than on the adult series and Ramsay almost-never swears (and in the rare moment that he does, it's never directed at the kids).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/StripSearch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/StripSearch">Strip Search</a></em> has a surprisingly minimal amount of this for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">reality TV</a> show — Graham Stark, the host, commented at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">PAX</a> Q&amp;A that he kept noticing opportunities to play games with the footage, but passed them up in favor of producing a more true narrative. That said, there are a few occasions where what they <em>show</em> the artist doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">seconds before the timer runs out on a challenge</a> doesn't match what the artist claims to have been doing at that point.
</li><li> The plot of Glove and Boots' <em>#CancelGloveandBoots</em> is kicked off when Mario is filmed saying "I don't like juice", which is taken out of context as evidence of antisemitism (with his accent, "juice" does sound a lot like "Jews"). In the process of defending his friend in an interview, Fafa mentions that he doesn't like "The Chinese bubble tea drinks", which of course is cut down to "You know what I don't like? The Chinese".
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ThirdRateGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ThirdRateGamer">Third Rate Gamer</a> uses this a couple of times:
<ul><li> At the beginning of his <em>Chip n' Dale</em> review, he complains there is no two-player mode, but he really just hid the option and said they buried it too deep into the menu. This was to parody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer">The Irate Gamer</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a> 6</em> review.

</li><li> In his review of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em>, he tells the audience to see how slow Simba is running "in this unedited footage", said as he then abruptly slows down the footage.
</li><li> Parodying the Irate Gamer's <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> example above, he slows down the footage and complains about how slow the star is. Unlike the Irate Gamer, he didn't bother to mute the music.
</li><li> In his <em>Daze Before Christmas</em> short review, he plays a death montage to show how difficult this game is, and it's the exact same death scene played multiple times, with him exclaiming "Shit!" each time.

</li><li> Something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps">Game Grumps</a></em>, where one of the guys will say something deliberately outrageous, then add "Please don't take that out of context." Flipped around in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> series, where Arin and Dan deliberately say provocative, sexual things, and Barry edits the audio into something completely innocuous:
<div class="indent"><em>"Thirty-seven [...] ducks [...] do [...] little backflips. Twenty [...] ducks [...] lie [...] on the ground. The [...] crazy [...] duck [...] is [...] my favorite duck."</em>
</div><ul><li> Using deceptive edits in a serious context is why Arin strongly dislikes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTelevision">Reality Television</a>, believing it's bullshit that "reality" television would do this. Having been on such a show once, he claimed they did this constantly and described how they took a clip of him fake-crying and, with careful editing and adding sad music, made it look as if he was crying for real.
<ul><li> Arin isn't shy about talking about the manipulative methods <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTelevision">Reality Television</a> will use, based on his experience. He notes that he was asked about a female guest, and gave an honest but normal response ("Yeah, she's pretty cool"), and then was asked much more leading questions, like "What did you think of what she was wearing" and "Did you like her". He pointedly refused to give the soundbites that the producers were looking for (he noted they specifically wanted him to say that she was pretty, gorgeous, or something similar), and they were disappointed, but didn't <em>stop trying</em> similar tactics later.
</li><li> Ross also notes that his (then) wife Holly Conrad was appearing on Heroes of Cosplay, and contractual obligations absolutely required him to be present during interviews with Holly, despite the fact that he had nothing to do with the show. As a result, he decided to fuck around and always wore the same clothes any time he would appear on camera, making it <em>look</em> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeEditing">Manipulative Editing</a> was being used by implying that Holly's interviews were all being conducted on the same day. As a result, eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAccordingToPlan">he was not asked to show up in interviews after several appearances.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> It's also the reason they'll never say certain things or words. They know they're one n-bomb away from someone taking that sound bite out of context and dragging them through the mud with it, and they also simply don't want such a sound bite to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">internet meme</a> or anything like that. They'll go far enough to actually bleep such words out if they slip or quote something just to ensure they're never caught on mic saying it.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Atop the Fourth Wall</a> in an April Fool's Day episode parodying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheIrateGamer">The Irate Gamer</a>. He turns the pages upside-down while complaining they printed the pages upside-down, complains that it takes forever to turn a page while slowing down the footage, and skips to the end while complaining that there was nothing in the comic book. Linkara even gives credit to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ThirdRateGamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ThirdRateGamer">Third Rate Gamer</a> for inspiration.

</li><li> A lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CinemaSins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CinemaSins">CinemaSins</a></em> videos conveniently edit out scenes of characters explaining or justifying a thing. For instance, their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> video complains about the bone in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/StarWarsCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/StarWarsCreatures">Rancor</a>'s mouth shifting position, cutting out the split second where Luke shifts its position.

<ul><li> In the Best Team Radio for the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix the clip is edited in a way that makes it look like Pierre Gasly is screaming at his team over the radio to check for fire while pulling to a stop while in the actual race he was yelling over the noise at a marshal standing by the track to check when they hesitated not knowing what to do after he'd already pulled to a stop, and he stopped as soon as someone let him know the car wasn't visibly on fire.
</li><li> In the Best Team Radio for the 2019 German Grand Prix the editing mixes around Lewis Hamilton's radio about tires during his slide into the wall, removing the bit where he said the tires were ridiculous right before sliding and using radio from the pitstop he'd made before the crash.
</li></ul></li><li> The page image itself has often gotten internet-made parodies, often implying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">it was doctored the same way the cameraman recorded the chase</a>. Examples of the "full" image include: another person with a camera/smartphone correctly recording the chase, the cameraman recording the whole thing, but being filmed in a bad position by a third party behind them to make them look corrupt, text that reveals the scene was being filmed like that because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProsceniumReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProsceniumReveal">it was a movie set</a>, the second guy shown as really being as innocent as the cameraman recorded, multiple cameramen focusing on different parts of the scene, and somebody about to apprehend the guy with the knife but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItBleedsItLeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItBleedsItLeads">no combination of the above bothering to show that</a>.

Homer is accused of molesting a college-aged babysitter after peeling a rare gummi candy off the seat of her pants, so he goes to an interview on the news show "Rock Bottom" to explain himself, but his testimony gets warped into an admission of guilt (even better with the clock in the background that noticeably changes back and forth with each cut - something the writers admit on the DVD commentary makes no sense, since the original dialogue only takes Homer about a minute to say):
<div class="indent"><strong>Homer</strong> (<em>actual dialogue</em>): Ehh, someone had to take the babysitter home. Then I noticed she was sitting on the gummi Venus, so I grabbed it off her. Oh, just thinking about that sweet, sweet candy...(<em>moans lustfully</em>) I just wish I had another one right now. But the most important thing is—"

Johnny manages to hack off some aliens somehow, so they rig up a kangaroo court and challenge Sue, Reed, and Ben to prove to them that they shouldn't execute his irreverent ass right on the spot. Every time they try to say something in his defense, the aliens replay a moment from the past where they said the exact opposite thing in the heat of the moment after Johnny did something annoying. Attempts to call the aliens out on this Trope were met with a response not dissimilar to "Well, we're the ones with the video playback, jackass, so what are you gonna do now?"

Muffy's method involves having her butler Bailey call Catherine with a survey of random questions and recording her (obviously expected) answers with a tape recorder, which she will edit into a voice message to send to Chip.

</li><li> Discussed in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2010/aug/11/castaway">this article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <em>The Guardian</em>. Among the points the author, himself a former reality show participant turned therapist, notes is that few people consider the possible psychological effects to someone who's been publicly demonized in this fashion by such techniques after they leave the show.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4">Channel 4</a>:
<ul><li> The channel once made a documentary called <em>Fat Girls and Feeders</em> with real feeders and feedees brought in to tell their stories. According to the feeders and feedees who took part in the documentary, Channel 4 edited the footage to make it look like the feedees were sad and the feeders were abusive. <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051001152557/http://www.feeder.co.uk/fat_girls_and_feeders.html">Here's what just one of the feedees had to say.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASMRVideo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASMRVideo">ASMR Video</a> creator Sophie Michelle <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/beyondapearl/status/1066091666862411777?lang=en">gave an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on Channel 4 in late 2018 talking about ASMR and her career making videos. The studio later edited the footage in a manner that was quite unflattering and showed said footage without her consent on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gogglebox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gogglebox">Gogglebox</a></em>, which led to the people on that show rudely criticizing her and her work.
</li></ul></li><li> For a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> summary from a former journalist of how this is done in real life, see: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07NMglQX6gE&amp;list=FLNvBDxxOuDioCJcvAqISxcw&amp;index=7">TV tricks of the trade<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by potholer54, AKA Peter Hadfield.
</li><li> This also leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a>. The media will always hunt for the most unstable people, and sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveButDelayed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveButDelayed">cut parts out of interviews</a> to make them look more crazy.
</li><li> In Chile there was a lot of controversy regarding a condominium where maids and workers were forbidden from entering on foot (so they had to use a special van). Inés Pérez, a woman who lived in the condominium, was interviewed in Chilevisión about the whole issue. She said that this wasn't a case of discrimination, since it was a free service for the workers, and the people living there were paying it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Inés Pérez</strong> (rough translation): Can you imagine all those maids walking outside, all those workers walking on the street, and your kids there riding bikes? Can you imagine all those maids walking on the street in winter (...)? (...) I live almost at the end. I go running around the condominium, and it's half an hour from my house to the lodge. I mean, can you imagine my maid walking to my house everyday, in winter under the rain? I mean, impossible!
</div><ul><li> However, the channel had the <em>brilliant</em> decision of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistingTheWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistingTheWords">cutting the clip right after the your-kids-riding-bikes part</a>, making it seem like she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">terrified of maids walking in the street</a>. This case is especially notable because this one editing trick caused even <em>more</em> of a controversy, to the point of creating a whole <em>meme</em>, with insults and mocking directed at her coming from everywhere in the internet.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a> News's highly criticized report on out-of-control Toyotas accidently made it clear that there was something up with its report when the shot of the tachometer rocketing up also had the door open, parking brake, and check engine lights all on, meaning the car was stopped, and it wasn't a shot from when the car was supposedly accelerating out of control. They later apologized and said it was hard to get a shot of the tach while the car was moving, and replaced the shot with one that was even more staged.
</li><li> Australian current affairs programs (such as <em>Today Tonight</em>, <em>A Currant Affair</em>, <em>The Bolt Project</em>) utilize this trope frequently in their reports, though it does not go unnoticed. Whilst the video is at least five years old, <a class="urllink" href="http://youtu.be/GMVKv3He3Mg?t=1m14s">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> weekly segment from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChasersWarOnEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheChasersWarOnEverything">The Chaser's War on Everything</a></em> covers real-life examples of the trope that still happen today.
</li><li> <em>New York Times</em> journalist Jacques Steinberg has had his headshot manipulated and shown on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel">Fox News</a>. A similar editing job was done to television editor Steven Reddicliffe, which stretched his forehead into nearly a seven-head.
</li><li> Some sociology students on a college actually did this as a project - they intentionally amassed volunteers to showcase how this can paint an inaccurate picture about a social group. What they did was showcase the (consensual) engineering students as complete idiots in one video; wherein they showcase engineers who cannot answer simple math questions and are unaware of who is running the country or simple historical facts. Meanwhile, the non-engineers get the questions all right, and can solve puzzles much faster than engineering students.
<ul><li> The <em>second</em> video showcases what they <em>did not</em> show. It started off with the volunteers being briefed on what it was, them consenting to it, and engineers <em>intentionally</em> answering questions wrong. (Trying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">not to give too outlandish an answer, despite being told that people might actually believe they thought that</a>) Also shown was how they "Randomly" selected someone from a crowd who happened to have been a volunteer who was planted there, always searched for someone who was tired or drinking coffee (Because they would be more likely to mess up), engineers taking their time solving a puzzle whereas the non-engineers were shown the solution ahead of time and had practiced, so they could place it together quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> NBC was found to have done this against George Zimmerman in regards to his 911 call. The actual call went something like this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Zimmerman:</strong> This guy looks like he's up to no good. Or he's on drugs or something. It's raining and he's just walking around, looking about.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>911 Police Dispatcher:</strong> OK, and this guy  is he black, white or Hispanic?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Zimmerman:</strong> He looks black.
</div><ul><li> NBC however presented the call like this:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Zimmerman:</strong> This guy looks like he's up to no good. <strong>He looks black</strong>.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CNN">CNN</a> also did this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonPaul">Ron Paul</a> after he cut an interview short with correspondent Dana Bash. When initially reported on Paul was presented as being incredibly rude to Bash for virtually no reason. It was later revealed that Paul cut the interview short because Bash kept asking him about controversial, seemingly racist articles published in Paul's campus newspaper two decades earlier, and though he answered the question repeatedly Bash <em>kept asking the question</em> as though she wasn't satisfied with his answer.
</li><li> Another from CNN—Susan Roesgen was sent out to cover a Tea Party rally. She seemed to only go out of her way highlight the most controversial signs in the crowd and tried to make it seem like the people she interviewed didn't know what they were talking about. She also appeared skiddish and openly told the newsroom reporter she feared for her safety in the crowd—despite the protestors behind her not actually doing or saying anything threatening.
</li><li> MSNBC did a story about the Tea Party movement, and specifically focused on an unidentified man holding an automatic assault rifle at one rally. After showing the image, the panel expressed concern about racism in the Tea Party and that only white people attend the rallies. However, it was revealed that the video had been cropped to hide the fact that the wielder of the assault rifle had been <em>African American</em>.
</li><li> Australia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NineNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NineNetwork">Nine Network</a> decided to go to war with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRamsay">Gordon Ramsay</a> on behalf of their reporter Tracy Grimshaw. The short of it is that Gordon and Tracy do not get along and Gordon referenced her at a conference (but did not use her name) and made disparaging comments about her. Tracy retaliated by <em>lying</em> about what Gordon had actually said (i.e. claiming that Gordon made offensive comments about Tracy being a lesbian), and in response reporters for the network <em>harassed</em> Gordon in public places while he was in Australia over what he'd allegedly said. And despite the fact that they were harassing him (and that Gordon at one point had to hail security at his hotel), the Network continued to present him as a bully.
</li><li> This was a staple of propaganda broadcasts in Eastern Europe during the Communist era. A particularly noteworthy example happened in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Romania">Romania</a> during Nicolae Ceaușescu's final speech on 21 December 1989. In a bid to calm the unrest that had boiled over in the previous weeks (after simmering below the surface for most of his tenure), he promised various wage and pension increases, and the crowd were shown waving Romanian flags and shouting pro-government chants. However, the same shots were re-used multiple times, and the flags and banners noticeably did not match the live footage of the crowd, while the sound audibly cut in and out between shots of Ceaușescu speaking and shots of the "audience reaction". The crowd had really been booing and heckling Ceaușescu, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreExperiencingTechnicalDifficulties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreExperiencingTechnicalDifficulties">a break in the live transmission</a> until order could be restored (the cameras continued rolling, pointed at the sky but still picking up the sound of the stunned Ceaușescu acting as though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThisThingOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThisThingOn">his microphone was malfunctioning</a>), after which the crowd greeted the speech with stony silence.
<ul><li> One apocryphal story about Cold War tensions plays this for laughs with a healthy dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a>. Race car engineers from each country decide to see which of their technologies makes for a faster vehicle with a one-on-one race. After the American car wins, the Russian media (conveniently leaving out the number of racers) reports that the Russians came in second, while the Americans finished "next-to-last."
</li></ul></li><li> Happened with Andrea Mitchell during the 2012 US Presidential Elections. Video was aired of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney supposedly being "amazed" by the use of a computerized screen to custom-make a sandwich at a Wawa, a Pennsylvania sandwich chain <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6suu3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6suu3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6suu3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This harkened back to reporting almost 20 years prior, where then-President George H.W. Bush was amazed by a self-checkout in a grocery store, remarks that Mitchell made when the clip was aired.</span>. However, the full footage was actually Romney making a comparison between the chain's innovation to the mountain of paperwork a friend of his filled out with the United States Postal Service just to change his address. Mitchell aired the unedited footage without apology the next day.
</li><li> After a drive-by shooting involving two teens, Chicago CBS affiliate WBBM aired a "disturbing" <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwc3x6rjbhU">interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with a 4 year old African-American boy who "wasn't afraid of nothing" and, when asked if he was going to stay away from guns when he got older, said "no, gonna have me a gun". Unfortunately, they left out the next sentence where he said he was going to have a gun because he was going to be a police officer.
</li><li> A documentary hosted and executive produced by Katie Couric called <em>Under the Gun</em>, in which dead space and pauses were added after the reporter asked questions about background checks to a gun-rights group, to make it appear as though they had no answers to her questions. However, unedited footage showed they had clear, prompt, and articulate answers to her questions. As a result, Couric and the producers face a $12 million defamation lawsuit from the group.
</li><li> Educational Documentaries:
<ul><li> Despite being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage">Don't Shoot the Message</a> titles with expert opinions and good intentions, even these aren't safe from this.

<div class="indent"><strong>Original</strong>: I came in and the officers said I have gang affiliation with gangs so I wear an orange uniform.

</li></ul></li><li> President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and First Lady Nancy once made a televised address from the White House in which they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">urged children to avoid drugs</a> and Nancy talked about how her suggested response to drugs, "say no", had spread among young people, spawning "just say no" clubs and so on. Before long <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nsibhl1vco">an edited version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> started making the rounds in which the Reagans' advice was completely inverted: "say yes" to drugs, her message had spurred the creation of "just say yes" clubs, etc. The editors' job was helped by the complete form of the message ("say yes to life, say no to drugs"), which provided the source of the "say yes" version. This being the 1980s, the methods used were old school: for example, replacing Nancy's "say no" with her saying "say yes" lifted from elsewhere in the speech involved a momentary cut to Reagan silently looking on to prevent a visible jump from one bit of Nancy footage to the other.
