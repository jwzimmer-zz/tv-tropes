</div></div><p>Creative jobs (acting, writing, making music or films, etc) are often seen by their fans as some kind of utopian ideal; you're creating art, using your imagination, and are apparently freed from the nine-to-five wage slave grind. Writers, actors, voice actors, and artists seem to have an edge over the rest of us; they're doing something they enjoy, something really creative, something that makes people happy. How could you <em>not</em> enjoy a job like that?
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Oh, it's possible. Fact is, creative jobs remain just that: jobs. And while they can be fun and interesting, like any job they can also be draining; factor in deadlines, editing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, rejection letters, failed auditions, tedious PR drives and, of course, the dreaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a>, and it's apparent that there are things that can make what may have been a dream job seem more like a nightmare. Whilst many artists cope admirably with all of this, others can suffer and become quite disillusioned.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/InternalSubtrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/InternalSubtrope">Sometimes this can result in</a> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">artist disillusionment farewell, where the character publicly ends his career</a> - often with a heavy dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">Take That, Audience!</a>.
</p><p>Sometimes, however, it's only temporary. The artist might simply be having a bad day. Sometimes they might just be a bit shaken by their circumstances and surroundings; whilst some thrive in the limelight, others, particularly more behind-the-scenes figures such as writers and directors, may find being faced with crowds of fans and interviewers unsettling and nerve-wracking, which can make their mood sharper than it otherwise would be. In either case, meet them when they're in a better mood or in more comfortable circumstances, they're fine.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>True artist disillusionment is when the artist just isn't having any fun at all anymore and is making no secret of that fact. They've given up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">Slave to PR</a>, and as such are rude and dismissive in public appearances and interviews, snap the head off fans who manage to fray their one remaining nerve, and generally come across as a grouchy, impatient jackass. Their work may even begin to suffer. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsApathy">They just don't care anymore.</a> And this lack of caring tends to express itself through insults towards their audience and fans.
</p><p>Overfamiliarity can play a part; some artists have been doing their job for decades, which is easily long enough for boredom to kick in. They might be sick of all the executive meddling they have to face or have achieved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">Protection from Editors</a> to such a degree that anyone daring to raise a word of criticism is going to rub them up the wrong way. And sometimes the artist is just naturally a bit grouchy, intolerant and impatient, or is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> type. All of which is going to make an unpleasant experience for the poor sap who happens to get on the wrong side of their temper.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>It's not all one way, however; unfortunately, the artist's fans can play a not-insignificant role in their idol's disillusionment. There's a reason some of them are called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDumb">Fan Dumb</a>, after all. Too many obnoxious or arrogant fans can turn the artist off their fanbase <em>entirely</em>, fairly or not. Where the artist sees their creativity as just a job, the fan may see it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">a holy way of life</a>, which can create tension if the artist isn't treating the property as seriously as the fan would like. The fan may believe that their devotion to the product means that they have part or even <em>full</em> ownership over it, and if they have no hesitation upon bluntly expressing their views about it to the artist, this is going to grate even if the artist doesn't have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">Protection from Editors</a>; the artist is the one who has to make the thing, after all. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpleasableFanbase">Unpleasable Fanbase</a> can also have this effect, since no matter what the artist does they're still going to have to listen to someone whine about it.
</p><p>In either case, Artist Disillusionment and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisillusionment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisillusionment">Fan Disillusionment</a> may have a circular relationship; the fan might suffer disillusionment after their idol was cruel or dismissive towards them, but the artist might have only been that way because they'd been disillusioned from having to deal with the many obnoxious examples of fan dumb before them and had run out of patience.
</p><p>As a coping strategy, some artists adopt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlterEgoActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlterEgoActing">Alter-Ego Acting</a> to counter possible artist disillusionment. Others simply don't bother with public appearances and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">disappear from public scrutiny</a>. May lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">Creator Breakdown</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a>. It may also result from the artist discovering that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">Celebrity Is Overrated</a>. When artists take away something from their fans, often in response to fan dumb, that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyFandomCantHaveNiceThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyFandomCantHaveNiceThings">Why Fandom Can't Have Nice Things</a>. If the artist expresses these sentiments in a public writing or speech, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DearNegativeReader">Dear Negative Reader</a>.
</p><p><em>Note that Artist Disillusionment is against fans. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a> is against works.</em>

<ul><li> Hideaki Anno was reputed to be resentful of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">Misaimed Fandom</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> as well as the death threats his fans sent him after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a> of the series that he created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">a film that more or less replaced the last two episodes</a> as the true ending. Without giving anything away, it was the <em>exact opposite</em> of what many fans of the series wanted and, in some cases, expected. The truth is this was the original ending before executive meddling, and with the exception of one or two scenes, the work was not intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">jab</a> against the fans. He did show the death threats sent to him <em>on-screen</em> after the movie was over, and a certain scene of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanDisservice">Fan Disservice</a> is interpreted to target some of the fans. However, according to <a class="urllink" href="https://wiki.evageeks.org/End_of_Evangelion_Death_Threats">various translations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the quick-flashing letters in the live-action sequence, most of them are actually fairly supportive letters, some from middle-schoolers (the same age range as the main character) telling Anno how much <em>Evangelion</em> inspired them and helped them in their own lives. Only two of these, the more negative and threatening of the lot, can really be considered "death threats".
</li><li> The author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero">Re:Zero</a></em>, Tappei Nagatsuki, is a unique case in that not only does he despise modern day NEET otaku, but he also despises the light novel industry, particularly generic Isekai stories, in general, hence many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero">Re:Zero</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">jabs toward the audience</a> being the result of this. Nagatsuki has even stated outright that the reason his characters suffer great pain that is a little too close to home for many of these Otaku is that he feels modern Isekai LN authors aren't ballsy enough to do so.

<ul><li> Bob Budiansky, the first writer of the Marvel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">comic book</a> who did a lot to develop the franchise, is a variant. He doesn't actually dislike <em>Transformers</em> fans, but he is rather bemused by the fact that they obsess over something that to him was just another creative job.
</li><li> The late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DwayneMcDuffie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DwayneMcDuffie">Dwayne McDuffie</a> had dealt with this in his various works, critically opining about editorial interference in his stories and complaining about fans who claimed he was trying to "force diversity" down their throats. He was also vocal about the racism in both the comic industry and fandom. He was also highly critical of the stereotypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LukeCageHeroForHire">Luke Cage: Hero for Hire</a>, whom he intensely disliked for promoting the "gangsta" image.
</li><li> Joe Casey (one-fourth of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ManOfActionStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ManOfActionStudios">Man of Action Studios</a>), who famously wrote a story complaining about how his fans prefer his mainstream friendly super-hero stuff that was continuity heavy and took back an apology he offered them when he realized that said apology's confession about him having a huge drug problem (and producing some of his worst work as a writer while on drugs), pretty much painted him in a bad light. His disillusionment (and fan disillusionment with him) culminated in his getting Superman/Batman cancelled when he totally refused to go along with editorial request that he write a follow-up story for his Superman crossover "Our Worlds at War" (as DC was retooling Superman/Batman to focus on the aftermath of their '00s crossovers) and got fired from the title mid-arc when he sent them instead a generic Superman/Batman versus alien story instead. Casey was promptly blacklisted from DC as a result, not that he cares it seems.

<ul><li> The late science fiction author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a> had developed something of a notorious reputation for being somewhat... crabby, due to a combination of a willingness to speak his mind and an <em>un</em>willingness to tolerate fools gladly (and a willingness of fans and other writers to prank him for this), which led to some interesting confrontations both with fans and professionals alike. Ellison insisted, however, that this element of his personality was exaggerated, and that he was not nearly as mean-spirited and unpleasant as the stories about him would have you believe. On the other hand, he's called people he didn't like, "Niggers with attitude." Though maybe he was just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NWA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NWA">N.W.A.</a> fan.
<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PennyArcade">Michael Krahulik and Jerry Holkins</a> were guests of honor at an event with Ellison, Ellison mocked Krahulik (Gabe) in front of the entire crowd <em>merely for not having gone to college</em>. Holkins (Tycho) summed it up like this:
<div class="indent"> Let's be clear here: We're talking about a person that a couple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">total assholes</a></em> find rude.
</div><ul><li> Mike got him back with this line.
<div class="indent"> "While I've got you here, I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> stuff you wrote."
</div></li></ul></li><li> Neil Gaiman described him as "A cranky, old Jew who is in love with his cranky-old-Jew-ness", in the documentary <em>Dreams with Sharp Teeth</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> eventually became sick and tired of writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em> stories, to the point where he eventually killed the character off in <em>The Adventure of the Final Problem.</em> Fans were horrified and outraged, but Conan Doyle was initially unmoved. He had a change of heart, however, when magazine editors began offering him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">absurd amounts of money</a> <em>and</em> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">his mother</a> asked him to restart writing about him. It seems that Conan Doyle simply needed some time to recharge his creative batteries, as post-revival adventures like <em>The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans, The Adventure of the Dancing Men</em> and <em>The Adventure of the Devil's Foot</em> are all excellent stories that rival or even exceed some of the early works.
<ul><li> In a prologue to the final set of stories, Conan Doyle mentioned how adult men who came up to him and said that his Holmes stories were some of their favorite stories as children didn't get the response from him that they'd anticipated. On the other hand, he also noted that writing Holmes stories hadn't prevented him from flexing his literary muscle in other areas.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigCharles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CraigCharles">Craig Charles</a> (Lister in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>) has expressed his exasperation at spending "half (his) adult life at <em>Red Dwarf</em> conventions" on the DVD documentaries of the series. Given that <em>Red Dwarf</em> has been on the go since 1988...that's a <em>lot</em> of conventions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> Robert Beltran, the actor who played Commander Chakotay on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>. If he ever had a nice thing to say about the show (tripe), its creators (hacks), its fans (losers), or his co-stars (prima donnas), he's kept it under his hat. Midway through the show's run, Beltran started giving interviews to Trek fansites critiquing the rabid fanbase, the ridiculous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">Technobabble</a>, and the contrived writing. There have been stories of fans actually breaking into tears at conventions after listening to his rants, and he's never shown any indication of mellowing out over the years (an online promo shot in 2008 for a play Beltran was starring in at a Los Angeles theatre had him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamWesting">passive-aggressively mocking his fans and telling them to support him by buying tickets</a>). Reportedly, Beltran was angling to be let go from the show, but Paramount exacted revenge by keeping Chakotay alive for all seven seasons - when he demanded an enormous raise in a deliberate bid to get fired, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">they simply handed over the cash</a>.
</li><li> The shooting of VOY was extremely taxing and frustrating for nearly everyone involved. Beltran was probably the least tactful of the participants, but by no means is he alone in those opinions. Probably for this reason, the DVD box sets include very little behind-the-scenes footage or interviews with the cast, such as Tim Russ (who doesn't even bother to hide his fatigue). Mostly, they are puff pieces featuring (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnubByOmission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnubByOmission">some</a>) of the writers and producers.
</li><li> For many years, the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> showed signs of this, as they were angered over the constant pressure from fans and executives who only saw them as the characters they played on the show. This came to the forefront in the 1980s for several of them, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a>'s notable anti-<em>Trek</em> rant on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardNimoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeonardNimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>'s famous tell-all book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">I Am Not Spock</a></em> (where he categorically stated that there was much more to his life than a character he played for three seasons and a handful of movies). Notably, the 80's book <em>Trek Memories</em> went into detail about the crew's hatred of their fame and fanbase, but eventually, they all came around and acknowledged their characters again, and Nimoy published a follow-up, <em>I Am Spock</em>, addressing this turnaround. These days, of course, the TOS crew consider themselves custodians of Gene's legacy and are very territorial about it.
</li><li> A notable aversion was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDoohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesDoohan">James Doohan</a>, who absolutely loved the convention circuit and went out of his way to accommodate fans. On numerous occasions he has told a story about a fan who wrote him a letter that was <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/COJuF7n9gGA">basically a suicide note<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. So Doohan called her and invited her to a convention in Indianapolis. He then pulled a Scheherazade and told her that he expected to see her at the next convention, and the next, and the next, and it apparently worked. It worked so well that he had struck up a correspondence with her and acted as her mentor. After a while, he stopped receiving letters from her and was concerned that she had fallen to depression and suicide, and he hadn't kept hold of her address to reach out to her. Eight years later, he received another letter from her apologizing for the silence — she had returned to college and had gotten her Master's degree in Electronic Engineering.
<ul><li> A similar one <a class="urllink" href="http://www.basicinstructions.net/basic-instructions/2013/7/25/how-to-explain-your-personal-feelings.html">was related by the author<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/BasicInstructions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/BasicInstructions">Basic Instructions</a></em>, who had a cousin with muscular dystrophy attending a fundraiser, and Doohan, despite being at the height of his popularity, took it upon himself to spend the entire evening pushing her wheelchair and keeping her company.
<div class="indent"><strong>Scott</strong>: In that one evening, Mr. Doohan made lifelong fans out of many of my relatives... It's spoiled by the fact that many of them think he was in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, and some others believe he was an astronaut.
</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> himself reportedly did not want to be involved with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> because of all the stress involved with the original series, most notably playing referee between The Shat and Nimoy, each vying to be the star.
</li><li> Be careful about mentioning <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickStewart">Patrick Stewart</a> though. He's apparently heard enough about it that he now takes a rather dim view of fans gushing about his Picard. He's defended the show itself on several occasions though, so his disillusionment is purely with answering the same questions over and over.
</li></ul></li><li> Tracey Torme, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sliders">Sliders</a></em>, had to deal with a whole ton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, and according to the fan site <a class="urllink" href="http://earthprime.com">Earth Prime.com<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he hated what the show turned into. Go to the pages about the double episode "Exodus", and read the part about what he thought of it, you'll see.
</li><li> The cast of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988">War of the Worlds (1988)</a></em> were subject to this. When the second season premiered, viewers were reportedly incensed that the entire framework of the series had changed (including the deaths of main characters and the changing of several plot-related elements) that they decided to make their displeasure known with hateful letters written to the cast and crew. Their biggest targets were actor Denis Forest and actress Catherine Disher (who played the leaders of the Morthrai on the show). Disher was so angered by the derogatory and negative letters she received (both during and after the show) that, to this day, she won't talk about it at fan conventions.
</li><li> This was a major factor why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveChappelle">Dave Chappelle</a> pulled the plug on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChappellesShow">Chappelle's Show</a></em>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme">he'd grown sick</a> of all the people who would walk up to him saying lines like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">I'm Rick James</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsForEmphasisBitch">bitch</a>!" (once, while he was with his wife and children!), also believing they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">missed the point</a> of his show's sketches. In one live concert, Dave chewed his fans out:
<div class="indent"><strong>Chappelle:</strong> You know why my show is good? Because the network officials say you're not smart enough to get what I'm doing, and every day I fight for you. I tell them how smart you are. Turns out I was wrong. You people are stupid.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidSimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidSimon">David Simon</a> got himself in some hot water when he voiced his displeasure with new fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> who seemed to only latch onto the show because "Omar is so cool" rather than the deep, intricate storylines about very real social problems. But he did quickly say in another interview that his statement was perhaps too harsh, and he certainly doesn't want to tell people who enjoy his work that they can only do so in the way he wants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceGilligan">Vince Gilligan</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-warns-fans-to-stop-throwing-pizza-onto-walter-whites-roof-10102784.html">has openly criticized<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> people that throw pizzas on the roof of the house which was used for filming Walter White's residence, pointing out that a retired couple have lived there for some forty-odd years and doesn't deserve to be rudely harassed. Though reportedly the couple themselves are pretty gracious about it, so long as you ask them first.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinFreeman">Martin Freeman</a> harshly criticized overzealous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> fans in 2018, comparing them to Lennie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMen">Of Mice &amp; Men</a></em> stroking something he loves so hard that he kills it. He also accused them of being the reason for the show's infamous constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScheduleSlip">Schedule Slip</a>, as everyone just needs a break from them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RupaulsDragRace">Rupauls Drag Race</a></em>: Many former contestants have spoken against the show's rabid fanbase. For instance, any time a queen gets the "Bitch Edit" where she's made out to be the villain of the season, viewers will flood her social media with hatemail (including racial slurs if she's non-white) even if the other contestants come out and say she's actually a wonderful person 99% of the time and doesn't deserve such ire. Queens also criticize fans who only go to local shows when a "Ru Girl" is in town and don't bother to support their city's drag scene the rest of the time.

<ul><li> The most well-known example in music history: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a>.

</li><li> Perhaps the second most famous example of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LaurynHill">Lauryn Hill</a>. As the most notable member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFugees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFugees">The Fugees</a> she became a star thanks to their album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheScore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheScore">The Score</a></em>. When her solo debut <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMiseducationOfLaurynHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMiseducationOfLaurynHill">The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill</a></em> came out, it was both a critical and commercial success. Even when listened to today, it hasn't aged that bad, mostly because Hill made it more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Soul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Soul">Soul</a> album than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HipHop">Hip-Hop</a> album. But Lauryn didn't like the way the music industry worked, putting a ridiculous amount of effort into maintaining a personal vision without the burden of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, and in the end, decided that she wanted to focus more on her family. Not helping matters is that, a few years ago, she was convicted of tax evasion and has had quite a few financial setbacks as a result. Barring an Unplugged album that was released in <em>2002</em> and the occasional tour, she doesn't seem all that interested in bringing out new material, making a revival of her music pretty unlikely nowadays.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> famously dealt with this. They stopped touring in 1966 due to several factors, most of which can be traced to disillusionment with touring (due to issues from protests about the famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerThanJesus">Bigger Than Jesus</a>" comment to being unable to hear themselves play at venues). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> in particular suffered a serious case of this when it came to the Beatles, having publicly acknowledged on numerous occasions that the allure had worn well off for him by about 1965 or thereabouts. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> were for the most part rather dismissive of his songwriting efforts and tended to treat him as the baby of the group because he was the youngest didn't help matters much.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> suffered from two major bouts of this. The first affected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SydBarrett">Syd Barrett</a>, who found himself increasingly uneasy with their growing exposure, audience sizes, and TV appearances, and didn't want the group to become any more famous. None of the others agreed with this, their rising fame was impossible to halt, and Syd sought greater and greater refuge in drugs, leading to his downward spiral into paranoia and insanity. (This was later commemorated in the album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WishYouWereHere">Wish You Were Here</a></em>.) Roger Waters also suffered from the vast audiences and changed audience composition brought by their mainstream success following <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDarkSideOfTheMoon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a></em>. While their old psychedelic fans tended to be quiet during the numbers and appreciative at the end of them, the new mainstream fans, though very appreciative, were also very loud and rowdy, and usually spent the whole set calling for "Money". This culminated the infamous incident during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Animals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Animals">Animals</a></em> tour where Roger spat on a particularly loud and rowdy fan (and the fan <em>loved</em> it). This lead to the jokey suggestion that they needed a wall between him and the audience, which led to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Varg Vikernes</em> has a lot to say about modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMetal">Black Metal</a> fandom and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">the new BM bands too</a>, nothing nice.
</li><li> As the '70s progressed, 10cc became increasingly disillusioned with everything about international touring. The 1978 album <em>Bloody Tourists</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">most certainly not intended</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against holidaymakers, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hipgnosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hipgnosis">Hipgnosis</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://hipgnosiscovers.com/10cc/bloodytourists.html">sleeve image<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, of a man on a beach with a map plastered over his face, was commissioned to "Sum up in one image how we feel on tour."
</li><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters">Carpenters</a> first began performing, Karen Carpenter, who had been drumming since school, took charge of the drum kit but also sang. As her amazing voice made its mark on the growing audiences, she came under increasing pressure from managers and promoters to stop hiding behind her drums, glam up, and become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">lead singer and frontwoman</a> - none of which she wanted to do, and all of which made her uneasy. When her hand was eventually forced, the resulting stress, and the various stage fright coping methods she tried, all contributed to her mental and physical health issues and, ultimately, her untimely death in 1983.
</li><li> Satirist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> grew to hate touring so much he retired to academia after releasing only a handful of records. Ongoing political events only further decreased his desire to perform again, although he did rack up a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesameStreetCred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SesameStreetCred">"Sesame Street" Cred</a>.
</li><li> Narrowly averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>. By the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>, he was deeply unhappy with his work. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewbieBoom">Newbie Boom</a> after the deliberately radio-friendly <em>Let's Dance</em> led him to bigger audiences and more income than he'd ever known before, but also to two albums that just followed on from that style, whereas before he had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewSoundAlbum">followed his muse</a>. Critics picked on him, longtime fans labeled him a sell-out, and trying to please newer fans brought him little lasting satisfaction. After the Glass Spider Tour, he considered retiring from music to focus on painting. Guitarist Reeves Gabrels convinced him that he just needed to break away from pleasing others and rediscover his muse. While Tin Machine, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardRock">Hard Rock</a> group Bowie and Gabrels formed with Hunt and Tony Sales in the process, is widely regarded as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> by fans and critics, it did rekindle his love of performing and paved the way for an artistic comeback in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> as a solo artist. And the whole concept of his breakthrough album ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRiseAndFallOfZiggyStardustAndTheSpidersFromMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRiseAndFallOfZiggyStardustAndTheSpidersFromMars">The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</a>" was about the angst of being a rock performer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Keane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Keane">Keane</a> went through a phase of major infighting, during which one member developed drug problems. They came close to breaking up, but managed to recover...and the fact that their arguing helped create the popularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> album <em>Under The Iron Sea</em> didn't hurt.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael">George Michael</a> emerged from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">1980s</a> British <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">Boy Band</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wham">Wham!</a> in 1986, releasing his debut solo album <em>Faith</em> a year later. Though critically acclaimed and one of the top albums in 1987-89, making Michael a megastar as his own artist, he still felt his image as a sex symbol (a holdover from his Wham! days, but slightly more geared to an adult image) belied the artistry and craft he put into <em>Faith</em>, and he longed to be taken as a serious, even topical artist. Moreover, he was discovering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">his homosexuality in private</a>, which contradicted the macho, girl-crazy image he projected since the Wham! days, his parents and gay lover were both dying and he was having troubles with his label Sony. Soon, more serious-minded, less danceable and pop-friendly albums like <em>Listen Without Prejudice, Vol. 1</em> and <em>Older</em> emerged. Michael also appeared less and less in his own music videos, one of which, "Freedom '90", symbolically showed an image of his <em>Faith</em>-era leather jacket, blue jeans, and archtop acoustic guitar burning in a closet. His arrest for "lewd conduct"(i.e. exposing himself to an undercover police officer) in a public toilet in Beverly Hills in 1998 led to his eventual self-outing. This, and his consistent arrests for drunk driving and/or drug possession stunted his career, and he ended up never reaching the heights of his <em>Faith</em> days again.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKLF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheKLF">The KLF</a> found commercial success with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseMusic">stadium house</a> tracks, Cauty and Drummond quickly grew sick of dealing with the pop music industry. In particular, they got pissed at the number of washed-up former stars who contacted them in hopes of a collaboration (since The KLF's track with <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TammyWynette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TammyWynette">Tammy Wynette</a> had revived <em>her</em> flagging career). Their final, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">troll-tastic</a> performance was a clear attempt to burn as many bridges as possible on their way out.

It wasn't until he got serious with his then-girlfriend (who owned a gym) that he could afford to leave the band, and he stated in no uncertain terms that he was at the point where he was so tired of being a professional musician that he was doing a disservice to both the fans and his bandmates by staying in the band.

It should be noted that certain developers and journalists who saw first-hand what he was put through by the gaming community tend to be amazed he held on as long as he did. Phil was very vocal about slinging vitriol and seemed to almost encourage it coming his way, seeming to feed off the trolls. At some point, though, it seemed to hit a tipping point, and he lost all interest in dealing with the drama. Unfortunately, one can't just turn the internet off like that, and it never stopped coming in, leading to overload and total disillusionment.

Asking him questions he has been asked repeatedly will often be met with a link to a tweet asking followers to check and search his tweet log, and pestering him with fan dumb comments (e.g. complaining about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2">Bayonetta 2</a></em> being on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> or questioning his English skills, never mind that English is not his native language) will be met with a "fuck off" at best and a derogatory comment in Japanese followed by a block at worst. Furthermore, all of his replies are public, so being a nuisance to him is a one way trip to being humiliated by other followers. He makes it no secret that some of his fans piss him off, and whenever a major news site reports on him or his games, which is when his account takes a big jump in replies from followers, you can expect tweets along the lines of "Idiots rushing in..."

It's a bit hard to blame him for this as 1) this has been happening for years; 2) it's always been made clear that the story has priority over the rules; 3) many of the times he's accused of breaking the rules the actual rule is heavily debated and how it works in the comic is a legitimate interpretation of the written rule; or 4) the accusation is just wrong.

There's also the fact that these people seem to absolutely <em>hate</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth">Rooster Teeth</a> as there was heavy backlash towards "Yang Xiao Long vs. Tifa Lockhart" and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue">Red vs. Blue</a></em> crossover with "The Meta vs. Agent Carolina". Ben called out the fandom with a heavy snarking message "thanking" them for their "support" for making the crossover.
</li><li> YouTuber and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Sidemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Sidemen">Sidemen</a> member <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KSI">KSI</a> seemingly underwent this in 2017. He blacked out all of his profile pictures and banners across both YouTube and social media, took down some of his videos, and uploaded a series of tweets where he explained that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityIsOverrated">he had become disillusioned with his status as a "celebrity" and the extra privileges he got as a result</a>, even though everyone is created equal. He then "left" the Sidemen group he co-founded in August 2017, but came back the following month.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMysteriousMrEnter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheMysteriousMrEnter">The Mysterious Mr. Enter</a></em> admitted in a video post that he wants to take a break from reviewing animation. While he has no ire towards his fans, he's emotionally burnt-out over having the flaws of his older videos (including those that were made years ago and were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">apologized over</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">constantly brought up</a> even when he's trying to improve himself as a content creator; the situation went as far as losing a friend over the videos.

One of the reasons is that the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A">commentated Watch for Rolling Rocks in 0.5 A Presses<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> video led to a lot of new viewers coming in who would expect future videos to live up to the same quality standard of that. pannenkoek states that this is something that simply can't happen due to the fact that making commentated videos is tough and takes more time than an UncommentatedPannen vid, which are much simpler and (usually) shorter due to things like text commentary (where applicable) and less explaining, as videos on the latter channel often assume that you already have a grasp of the tricks that are being used. Another is that koek <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">had gotten into a fight with his parents before the release of WFRR in 0.5 A Presses, which left him in a very bad mood</a>. Since he wasn't using his free time for anything else, he invested it all into improving the WFRR video, and even when he could've gotten rid of the bad mood, he didn't because it was helping his productivity at the time. And yet another reason is that people are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedMeme">still repeating some of the memes spawned in the WFRR video</a>, which he still hasn't mentally recovered from making.

<ul><li> The "Hollywood Diva" archetype is a strange example. They're expected to be nasty to the press and condescending to their fans — in fact, most of them retain their following <em>due to</em> their negative attitude, not <em>in spite</em> of it.

<ul><li> Of course, he <em>has</em> been known in public to be very gracious and good-humored and friendly, so this may more be just a case of the fans who pester him to bring back <em>Invader Zim</em>, which he's grown to slightly hate due to it being bastardized by Nickelodeon and having nearly all control of it ripped away from him.

When talking to a hopeful with dreams of becoming a manga artist, Lida lists all the difficulties of being an artist: finances, inconsistent job flow, criticism, self-doubt, and the difficulties of the business end of things. Nonetheless, she still seems to find enjoyment in her job even with the disillusionment
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>, Kazuya Hiramaru, an overworked businessman, picked up a copy of <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em> on the way to work, decided he could draw manga for a living, and quit his job that day. He's now so overworked that he often does not sleep, drinks himself silly, and the only thing keeping him drawing is the fact that his editor knows a <em>lot</em> of pretty girls and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCakeIsALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCakeIsALie">promises to introduce him to them if he does well</a>.

</p><ul><li> In the graphic novels about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohannaAndHelena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JohannaAndHelena">Johanna and Helena</a>, Helena becomes a successful stand-up comedian, but really hates it. The worst part is that her inane babble is considered deep and true art and all that kind of bullshit. The emperor is indeed naked, but in this case, the emperor and the child are the same person. Eventually, she publicly denounces it all, pretty much claiming that the world must be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> after all since people obviously actually like a show such as hers.
</li><li> In one issue of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Riskhospitalet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Riskhospitalet">Riskhospitalet</a></em>, a news anchorman is saying all kinds of nasty things during a show broadcast in real time. As he finishes his speech with mooning the camera, his staff receives a phone call from the hospital - explaining that they mixed up the lab results and that the anchorman is in fact not dying.

She's still writing, but she lacks the courage to continue, at least until Twilight's visit.
</li><li> Spider Jerusalem, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a></em>, has something of a hate/loathe/disgust/contempt/pity complex regarding his fans. They read his journalism (which is good enough to be art, by any means) and find his exploits entertaining, and occasionally they listen to him if he shouts loud enough. On the other hand, they don't care enough, they don't get the message, and generally let him down. The volume "The New Scum" ends with him chucking grenades off a roof because, despite his column, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the public finally followed his advice and booted out the corrupt president "the Beast," but elected a president that Jerusalem found even more loathsome.</span>

Due to this, his repressed anger at fans who do things like pestering him in his private life, or showing him the real-person slash fic they wrote about him, manifests in the MMORPG as a monster that starts attacking and mutilating players.

As he's stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a>, he sometimes starts to bitch publicly as a way of venting his frustration.

</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest">Galaxy Quest</a></em> is all about this phenomenon and about the disillusionment and sense of lost opportunity that can result when an actor has to spend a large chunk of his/her life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">trapped by the popularity of a single role</a>.

</li><li> Billy Mack from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually">Love Actually</a></em> is a former big-name rock star who's fallen on hard times, and he just has stopped giving a damn and completely snaps when his newest desperate attempt to climb back to the top is an album full of song covers with slightly altered lyrics to make them Christmas-themed. At every public appearance, he gleefully lambastes the album while still asking people to buy it, just so the number one Christmas album won't be a cookie-cutter boy band. It works.
</li><li> Mike Connor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhiladelphiaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhiladelphiaStory">The Philadelphia Story</a></em> is a poet whose book netted him something in the range of $700, and so puts on a cynical front working as a tabloid reporter to pay the bills. Upper-class Tracy Lord, who he's spying on for material, reads his work and offers to sponsor his artistic endeavours only to have him shoot it down as old-fashioned and patronising of her to think she can just make him her "kept artist".
</li><li> The documentary <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenagePaparazzo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenagePaparazzo">Teenage Paparazzo</a></em> discusses this concept. A main point of the film is that celebrities in Los Angeles are just doing a job like everyone else, but face constant harassment from fans and paparazzi - so much so that they've become disillusioned and insular from the majority of society. Several examples of celebrities (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LindsayLohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>) who've gone down a self-destructive path due to the pressures of fame and a demanding legion of photographers trying to get their photograph are shown to prove this point.

Though definitely an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>, the novel does reflect on how Dungannon's anger comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">his inability to escape the series of pulpy,</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a></em>-esque novels that made him famous and be recognized as a serious writer who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">put a lot of effort into some parts</a>, such as the mythology. It also crosses over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a>, as at one point he compares himself to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">Jacob Marley</a>, forever chained to a series of cheesy fantasy novels. Of course, the guy <strong>is</strong> an egotistical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> regardless of the motivation, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">keeps him from being 100% unsympathetic</a>. Dungannon has quite a bit in common with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a>, to the point where fans believed that author Sharyn McCrumb wrote him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>; seemingly in order to defuse these accusations, she included a part where someone suggests getting Ellison to write Dungannon's eulogy (and it's noted that the two men despised each other). Amusingly, in the forward for a later edition of the <em>Bimbos</em>, McCrumb noted that she always knew which authors were "on the outs" with the fandom because people would ask her "Was (this guy) the inspiration for Dungannon?".

One example is "Across the Sea" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Weezer">Weezer</a>, which details Rivers Cuomo's dissatisfaction with the music business while singing about a fan letter from Japan.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CountingCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CountingCrows">Counting Crows</a> practically made their entire second album, <em>Recovering The Satellites</em>, about this, although "Have You Seen Me Lately" and "Monkey" particularly stand out. Ironically, their first hit "Mr. Jones" is about a struggling musician's wish for fame; their first live album <em>Across a Wire</em> contains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong">somber acoustic version</a> of the song, about how fame is "as fucked up as you can be".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a> wrote two songs about this, "I'm a Marionette" and the live-only "Get on the Carousel". Both songs are from an unfinished musical called "The Girl with the Golden Hair," a story more than loosely based on Agnetha's life, and how she went from being an enthusiastic young singer excited to begin her career ("Thank You for the Music" and "I Wonder") to being an exploited media-puppet trapped in a cycle of terror and despair ("I'm a Marionette" and "Get on the Carousel"). Some lines of "Super Trouper" also address the disillusionment and isolation experienced by everyone in the band.

That this was the album that followed up Manson's artistically ambitious "Tryptich" (the trilogy of rock opera albums including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AntichristSuperstar">Antichrist Superstar</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MechanicalAnimals">Mechanical Animals</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HolyWoodInTheShadowOfTheValleyOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HolyWoodInTheShadowOfTheValleyOfDeath">Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)</a></em>) was probably not a coincidence.

</p><ul><li> The band Dethklok from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em> qualify. While they love their music, they dislike working on new albums, hate their fans with a passion (as best seen in the song "Fansong" for the members of their fan club who showed up for fan appreciation day). They also dislike other people who work in the music industry with them (Nathan sighing at another "douchebag industry party" at the launch of their new album).
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Bart imagines life as a rock star performing a hit song called "My Fans are Stupid Pigs". The audience loves it. He also dealt with artist disillusionment when hired on to the Krusty the Clown show as a one-line wonder, complaining about the hollowness of his catchphrase.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore">Fillmore!</a></em> deals with two mega-fans of a book series called <em>Vampirita</em> trying to win a fan contest to become characters in the latest installment. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The latest book in the series is so bad that it drives one of the girls to sabotage all their efforts to keep them from being immortalized in a lousy book.</span> The author is shown to be jaded and dismissive of her fans, only still involved with the series due to contractual obligation. Her fans call her out on this attitude, citing that she at least should respect them enough to provide them with a coherent, satisfying story.
