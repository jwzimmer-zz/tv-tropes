Quick, clean, and quiet. The reality is not so simple. To kill someone with poison, either very quickly or without arousing suspicion, is a very complex process.
</p><p>Outside of highly controlled chemical munitions, there are very few substances available to the average murderer that can kill a human being as quickly and easily as the poisons of fiction. Famous poisons like arsenic, strychnine, cyanide, etc. require small, repeated doses to build up enough concentrations to kill without arousing the suspicion of the victim... in significant quantity, such poisons taste extremely bitter (hence the need for medieval food tasters). The mechanisms by which these poisons kill can cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">dramatic physical reactions</a> in the victim. And while it is true they were once very hard to detect, these old standby poisons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">easily and routinely detected by modern forensic pathology</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The sort of poisons that <em>can</em> kill very rapidly at small doses tend to be staggeringly dangerous to the poisoner himself, not to mention exceptionally hard to come by and hazardous to manufacture.
</p><p>There's also the matter of "getaway time" — a fast-killing poison is more dramatic, but a slow-killing one is harder to link to its source.
</p><p>This is generally assumed to be the kind of poison used in a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerLickingPoison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerLickingPoison">Finger-Licking Poison</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted: APTX-4869 is supposed to be one, and for the majority of victims has been, but certainly for our heroes, it's merely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">Fountain of Youth</a>. While APTX-4869 is currently being <em>used</em> as a poison, it's not really a "poisoner's choice" — when you're injecting somebody with a full hypodermic needle into a major artery, an awful lot of things become lethal (including air itself). It seems to need to be administered that way, and the people using it actually should have access to highly controlled chemical munitions. The point is that its effects on the body are so unusual (presumably due to what it was actually being developed to do) and so different from that of any publicly known drugs that forensics can't recognize the cause of death beyond the needle mark.
</li><li> They do have quite a few incidents where a person is killed by poison from a single dose administered a short time before the victim dies. You'd think the killers would want their target to drop dead somewhere other than the place they were poisoned to throw the police off the trail and give them time to dispose of the evidence, but that never occurs to them.
</li></ul></li><li> Partially averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: the Sasori's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedWeapons">Poisoned Weapons</a> are said to take three days to kill their victim, though they still take an improbably small amount to do so. At least he has a reason not to be concerned about their being dangerous to him (since he doesn't have a real body, and is thus immune to the effects). If it were actually a bio-weapon of some sort, it would explain why it can kill even in small doses, never kills faster, and why it is so difficult to cure. Probably targeting the nervous system, given its paralyzing effects.

</li><li> It took a few years for Harusada to be fed enough poison to incapacitate her...and to make sure she didn't suspect anything, her taste tester O-shiga ate the poison too, covering up the symptoms with heavy makeup. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The poison <em>finally</em> takes effect after Harusada tries to poison her own son Ienari.</span> O-shiga lives long enough to explain to Ienari that it was a plot she and his wife Shigu cooked up in revenge for...

Andrews' novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersInTheAttic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersInTheAttic">Flowers in the Attic</a></em> has a fairly realistic version of this trope: The unwanted children's meals include powdered sugar donuts that contain traces of arsenic. Each donut contains only a minute amount of arsenic so that the children will gradually and inconspicuously die after consumption of a significant number of donuts, and the powdered sugar ensures that they won't taste the poison's bitterness. The children unwittingly hasten the death of one of them by giving him all their powdered sugar donuts because he won't eat much else from the meals.

However, it's stated that the death takes some weeks, and it may well require repeated dosages. More messily, another poison causes symptoms which resemble anaphylactic shock or choking/suffocation—but the poison is stated to have magic in it, and it may have been sourced from an order of shape-changing assassins, so it may be justified. Other than that, all poisons are detected by food tasters, kill over time, or are not used to kill at all; for example, one character doses another with a poison that leaves her indisposed for a day or two so that he can work uninterrupted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And in the case of the Tears of Lys, it also helped that the Maester in charge of healing the victim knew he was being poisoned and was ordered not to cure him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">He subsequently covered up the death as "death by natural causes"</a>.</span>

However, he goes into great detail as to why most poisons are ineffective for this kind of use, too expensive, or just plain unattainable; eventually, he decides to fill each bullet with a thousand milligrams of pure heroin - dissolved with a drop of lemon juice - in the hope that even a nonlethal shot will result in a fatal overdose.

In fact, most poisons kill in somewhat over-the-top manners (Sadi, a Nyissan, eventually uses one to remove an obstructing Grolim disguised as an advisorit swells the throat to simulate choking). The closest there is to a "perfect" poison, thalot (a guaranteed kill even against magic because it poisons <em>everything</em> in the victim's body), has obvious symptoms and takes several days to finish off the victim. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then we find out that Garion accidentally created an antidote for thalot several books earlier; the attempt to poison Zakath <em>fails</em> because Polgara had some on hand.</span>

It is the mark of a truly gifted individual to be able to overcome the poison, which requires enough control of the body to be able to transmute the toxin within into a non-lethal psychotropic.

The source of infection is too great for the body to overcome before fever and delirium hits, and taking days to kill at that. To cure it, it requires a healer slowly chip away at the point of infection so the victim's body can destroy it.

Another episode featured a former teammate of Stephen winding up in the hospital of an apparent heart attack despite being in great physical health (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledPlot">Hey! Wait a second...</a>), and Stephen quickly finds an injection site that allows them to identify the poison (which, for bonus points, is radioactive, allowing them to track not only those who have been injected but also the home where the poison was kept, not only averting but annihilating the "untraceable" aspect). The poisoning did kill Stephen's friend, but neither quickly nor painlessly, and even the primary target, who'd received a much larger dose, stayed alive for quite a while afterward.

<ul><li> Realistic use of poison in most tabletop systems is extremely rare. This is mostly due to how roleplaying systems work — poisoning someone over weeks or months is usually hard to make work mechanically, and usually won't be on the list of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters">Player Characters</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">off their opponents</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 3.5 has a selection of poisons that deal a random amount of ability damage to one and only one ability score over two "doses". These damage doses happen exactly one minute apart regardless of the type of poison used. Terms such as dosage, dilution, or long-term exposure never enter into it. Poison-users <em>are</em> in danger of poisoning themselves during application, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to the above version of <em>D&amp;D</em>, has updated the poison rules in response to this trope. Poisons can now have a various onset time anywhere between six seconds and a day, and some poisons can last indefinitely. One particular poison can kill someone (by Constitution drain) over an arbitrarily long period of time.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>; the poison rules are designed around inflicting only one die of damage per time interval (which are generally in the hours), and can only inflict a limited amount of damage per dose. Multiple doses just extend how long the poison can last, while still only inflicting one die per interval. The most dangerous poison in the game (made from the concentrated hatred of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">demon gods</a> and tremendously rare and expensive) would still take about seven seconds to kill most people (and would be rather obvious about it).

The book lists about 25 'natural' compounds that characters could use instead, few of which are fast, but all can be effective over time, and details are given for each. At the end of the section, it reveals the real names of all but 2 of them, being based on real-world natural poisons.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> was in love with this trope. It seems like half his tragedies involve somebody getting poisoned with "the deadliest poison known to man".
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>: is particularly striking.
<ul><li> Laertes returns from abroad to find that his father had been murdered. Fortunately, he just so happens to have purchased a phial of Super Poison that he's going to use for the old "dueling with poisoned swords" trick. I guess that poison was available at souvenir stands all over France, next to the T-shirts and shot glasses.
<div class="indent"><strong>Laertes:</strong> "I bought an unction of a mountebank, so mortal that, but dip a knife in it, where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, collected from all samples that have virtue under the moon, can save the thing from death that is but scratched withal." Act IV, Scene VII.
</div></li><li> The ghost of King Hamlet also goes into lavish detail about his own death by poisoning — a poison that was dripped into his <em>ear</em> while he slept, and resulted in the most agonizing death throes, as well as hideous sores popping out all over his body.
</li><li> However averted if you go by the theory that Ophelia was secretly pregnant with Hamlet's illegitimate child. One of the herbs she mentions is rue - and the dialogue suggests she plans to take that. It's a mild poison that was commonly used to abort babies, as it has the effect of making the body so sick it rejects the growing embryo. It can result in death if too much is taken, and we never find out <em>how</em> Ophelia died.
</li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly common Super Poison also appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>. Although as that poisoning was voluntary it probably wouldn't have mattered if it had had a distinctive smell or taste. He also drinks the whole bottle in one go. Juliet tries to take the same poison by kissing Romeo's lips, but there's so little of it left that it won't work quick enough.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear">King Lear</a></em> has Goneril slipping Regan some poison secretly before the last scene. She is fine at first but then suddenly feels stomach pains and collapses immediately. Some productions will show Goneril giving it to her in another scene beforehand - implying it takes several hours to work.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Achaea">Achaea</a></em>, a large number of poisons are available and widely used in combat. Most only cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">hit point damage</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">status effect</a>, but Voyria is invariably lethal...At least it should be, if it didn't take a full thirty seconds to do its work, during which the player receives <em>six</em> warning messages describing unmistakeable symptoms (mild fever, nose bleeding, bloody vomit, heavy breathing) and has only to take a sip of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAntidote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAntidote">Magic Antidote</a> to instantly save himself. As everyone carries antidote with them, the only practical way to kill someone with Voyria is to prevent the victim from drinking or injecting medicine.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney">Hitman: Blood Money</a></em>: one of Agent 47's primary weapons is a syringe that can be used to inject targets at the jugular or to poison food. For efficiency's sake, instead of using a single poison, a mixture of chemicals is used: sodium pentothol, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. Since this is the exact combination of chemicals used in lethal injection executions, the victim dies quickly and noiselessly.
<ul><li> Which only kinda makes sense. In lethal injections, they use multiple IVs so the poisons don't mix beforehand and undergo a process called precipitation. A fancy way of saying they get all waxy and won't go in. And it can still take two hours for the victim to die. It would work better to just use one of the first two (the more fast-acting drugs) and strangle the person after they pass out.
</li><li> Probably the reason that 47 carries around a reel of piano wire. However, <em>Blood Money's</em> use of poison makes more sense than the previous game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanContracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanContracts">Contracts</a></em>: in several levels, you're forced to look for poisons in the surrounding area and dose people's food or drink with it, and weedkiller or rat poison isn't exactly painless or quiet.
<ul><li> It should be noted that the poison in Blood Money <em>isn't</em> undetectable; kills with poison count as regular kills rather than accidents.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2SilentAssassin">Silent Assassin</a></em>, one of the levels has as its target the son of a wealthy and powerful Japanese criminal. One way of achieving the kill is to sneak into the kitchen where a fugu dish is being prepared, and reintroduce the highly toxic liver to the dish. However, the toxin in the game works considerably faster than in real life.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dycedarg</span> slowly poisoned his father over many years, which the rest of the family mistook for an illness.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVII">Dragon Quest VII</a></em> has the whole debacle in Verdham where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Kaya</a> is slowly poisoning her husband. The poison she uses is a powder which she keeps in a vial around her neck; her husband is convinced it's his <em>medicine</em>, and you have to get the bottle away from her and its contents tested to prove otherwise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> has a whole skill based around the creation of poisons and toxins to coat weapons with. These work instantly, though they generally have effects other than instant death (slows the target, does damage over time, paralyzes or stuns for a few seconds, etc.). Only Quiet Death can instantly kill, and even then it only has about a 5% success rate.
<ul><li> The same goes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a></em>. There are also instantly fatal poisoned apples you can sneak into people's inventory, if they don't have any other food in there, they will eat the apples eventually and die.
<ul><li> Actually, the poisoned apples are not <em>quiiite</em> perfect; they only cause a permanent damage health effect of 10 per second. If you have a high enough health regen, you can survive, though it'll make the game much harder as you can't go to sleep again (can't sleep while being hurt). Cue the game ending instantly if you're forced to go to sleep, as your health regen drops to zero while sleeping as well.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Somewhat similarly to the above example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em> there is a powerful poison plant called Jarrin Root that is said to kill instantly. It causes 200 points of poison damage, which is more than enough to kill any low-level enemies. But when combined with other poisonous reagents and a high Alchemy skill the damage can range in the thousands.
</li><li> In an ending cut from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em>, Sky dies from drinking poisoned wine.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Cinders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Cinders">Cinders</a></em>, Cinders can choose to kill her stepmother Carmosa with a poison that's stated to produce no noticeable ill effects in its victim until they suddenly drop dead of a seeming heart attack a couple of hours later. Its unusual effects <em>could</em> be handwaved as the result of it being crafted by a fairy or witch with access to magical powers, though. Plus, Cinders's poisoning attempt can fail spectacularly if Carmosa doesn't trust her and has the breakfast Cinders serves her tested for poison, which indicates that the poison's "perfect" qualities don't include untraceability.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneThousandAndOneSpikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneThousandAndOneSpikes">1001 Spikes</a> explains the dart traps' quality of being able to kill instantly is because of them being poisoned. The Scorpions also qualify, because a single sting from them is immediately fatal.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AviaryAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AviaryAttorney">Aviary Attorney</a></em> someone dies frothing at the mouth moments after grasping a rose and exclaiming that they've been pricked by the thorns. The defense attorneys lampshade this trope, being unsure if any poison that strong exists. Turns out the real mechanism was a wolfsbane derivative <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> mixed with caramel and made into the filling for fancy chocolates</span> and took somewhat longer. Still undetectable, and strong enough that forty-five minutes after eating the wrapper which still bore traces of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the chocolate</span> another character is hospitalized.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>: In the third case of <em>Trials and Tribulations</em>, as well as the fourth case of <em>Apollo Justice</em>, the victim dies from cyanide poisoning and from a (possibly) fictional poison, respectively, but in both cases, the killer was more interested in having the person dead than hiding the method from the police (as far as <em>what</em> killed him, at least). As a result, the victim did not have a swift silent death but instead gave full display of the poisons' physical reactions for all to witness, and the police have no trouble in figuring out what killed the victim.
<ul><li> In the first case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DaiGyakutenSaibanNaruhodouRyuunosukeNoBouken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DaiGyakutenSaibanNaruhodouRyuunosukeNoBouken">Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhodou Ryuunosuke no Bouken</a></em>, the victim was revealed to have been killed with curare, a poison which the Meiji era Japan had no scientific means to detect. Since curare paralyzes the muscles and halts breathing, the victim died in a restaurant filled with people, and nobody even noticed until the killer proceeded to make it look like he died from a gunshot wound.

Litvinenko was killed when someone sprinkled polonium-210 into his teacup. Polonium-210 has many advantages: it can be carried safely in a vial of water without detection, and while death is certainly the initial symptoms don't immediately suggest poison, giving time for the poisoner to make a clean getaway. Furthermore, unlike most radioactive substances, polonium-210 only emits alpha particles that cannot penetrate even a sheet of paper, thus making it invisible to normal radiation detectors (and requiring it to be physically ingested to work as a poison). However, they made one big mistake: they thought it was undetectable. While the technology to detect polonium-210 didn't exist in Russia, it <em>did</em> in the West. Oops. Furthermore, whoever did the actual poisoning seemingly didn't realize how much polonium-210 contaminates. Simply uncapping the vial is enough to leave detectable amounts. This made Litvinenko's murder one of the most unsubtle in history, with investigators simply following the trail of radioactivity back to the murderer's hotel room.

However, the death was long and drawn out, and she only began showing symptoms in December of 1996. Three weeks after showing symptoms she slipped into a vegetative state alternating with periods of extreme agitation which was horrifying to watch with all the thrashing and stuff; however, doctors said she likely wasn't in pain - her brain was well beyond the point of transmitting the likes of pain signals. She did not actually die until June 8, 1997, when she was removed from life support. In this case, the poison wasn't untraceable. Weaponizing it would be tough: While a cheap supermarket squirt gun full of the stuff would ensure the deaths of targets better than a rocket launcher, we're talking something <em>so</em> toxic that if you <em>know what it smells like,</em> that means you've most likely taken in enough of it that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreAlreadyDead">You Are Already Dead</a>.
</li><li> The rumors spread about Lucrezia Borgia by her family's enemies often included a reference to a poison she made called "la cantarella." Even if the Borgias <em>did</em> have people poisoned, this particular substance was alleged to be <em>such</em> a perfect poison that it could not in fact have been real (according to some versions of the story, the poison could be fine-tuned to kill the victim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactTimeToFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactTimeToFailure">a specific preset time</a> after ingestion).
</li><li> The real-life poisons abrin and ricin are both very deadly, and can easily be manufactured from common ornamental plants, making the origin of the poison difficult to trace. In the assassination of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Markov">Georgi Markov<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, identifying the organisation that was likely responsible (the Bulgarian Secret Police) was not done by tracing the ricin, but by investigating the capsule used to deliver the poison - a matching pellet had been recovered in the case of Vladimir Kostov, another Bulgarian defector who was attacked ten days before Markov's murder, although in his case the pellet appeared to have been damaged before it entered his body and did not retain enough ricin inside it to cause his death. Neither poison kills as quickly as the trope demands, but they're about as close as real life gets.

Fictional works that feature the use of nerve agents as poisons usually have the poisoner steal their supply from military stockpiles (e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRock">The Rock</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a>'s <em>Binary</em>.) This is increasingly unlikely in the real world, as the aforementioned CWC came into effect in 1997 and prohibits the "development, production, acquisition, retention, stockpiling, transfer and use of all chemical weapons" in 188 countries. (Of the countries that are not signatories, all but one - South Sudan - have been accused of possessing chemical weapons.)

The target, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter Yulia, both survived the attempt to kill them, as did police officers who came into contact with traces of the poison afterwards; one person, Dawn Sturgess, did die, but as a result of being accidentally exposed to the discarded poison container after the attempt; and all the evidence (the type of nerve agent used - one variety of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novichok_agent">Novichok<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, developed by the Russian government; the likely identity of the poisoners as captured by CCTV; and of course the likely motive for attacking a former Russian spy) have pointed squarely at Russia as the overwhelmingly likely culprit. Russia denies being involved, but President Putin recently referred on-camera to Sergei Skripal, calling him a "Scumbag" and "Traitor", which does not exactly help their case.
</li></ul></li><li> The closest thing to a perfect poison is something that could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeItLookLikeAnAccident">passed off as an accident</a>:
<ul><li> Amanita mushrooms (death caps or destroying angels) could conceivably be eaten voluntarily by someone who doesn't know their mushroom lore. What makes these mushrooms nasty is that the toxins in them are stable even in extreme temperatures; <em>cooking them <strong>WON'T</strong> save you</em>.
</li><li> Improperly prepared lima beans or tapioca can be deadly to eat.
</li><li> Someone with a life-threatening allergy could be poisoned with the food they're allergic to, and that could be passed off as an accident.
</li><li> A form of poison which is hard to trace to a suspect is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">an excess of nicotine</a> (injected in a dose much larger than usually lethal) in one of the victim's cigarettes. By the moment the victim drops dead, the said cigarette is already consumed, and autopsy reveals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">only that he or she had a lot of nicotine in the body</a>. It's very unreliable for an assassin who does not have permanent access to the victim's personal belongings and therefore it has hardly been used. Also, a lethal dose of nicotine is usually a blatant giveaway of the foul play unless the toxicity screen test is provided several days after death.
</li><li> In countries and social strata which have a problem with counterfeit alcohol, methanol is a near-perfect poison. It could conceivably end up accidentally in a counterfeit bottle of spirit (there are more than enough <em>accidental</em> methanol poisonings caused by non-malevolently contaminated rotgut). It's nearly indistinguishable from ethanol and produces the same effects as ethanol, followed by certain death if ingested in a typical recreational dose. This method of poisoning was used in the short story <a class="urllink" href="http://205.186.130.127/images/uploads/Bargain%20-%20AB%20Guthrie.pdf">"Bargain"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by A.B. Guthrie, Jr.
</li></ul></li><li> Several animals produce toxins that could qualify as this. It should be noted that most of these critters are bright and colorful, which in nature means: <em>Hands off.</em> It should also be noted that these toxins wouldn't be a practical way for humans to poison each other. Very few people (mostly scientists) have access to these poisons and venoms<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1w6se');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1w6se" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1w6se');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the difference being that <em>venom</em> is injected while <em>poison</em> is absorbed through the skin, lungs, digestive system, etc.</span>, making them easy to trace.
<ul><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chironex_fleckeri">Chironex fleckeri<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (a kind of box jellyfish commonly called the "sea wasp") produces one of Earth's deadliest toxins. As per this trope, the venom takes effect instantaneously: the sea wasp's sting causes excruciating pain and an intense burning sensation (like a red-hot iron). It's only deadly when the sting area is significantly big, but in fatal cases, the victim can die within two to five minutes if untreated. An average sea wasp carries enough venom to kill sixty adult humans. Even worse, unlike other similarly venomous animals, the sea wasp is nearly invisible underwater. And yes, <em>Chironex fleckeri</em> is found along the northern coast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Australia</a>—but also along the coastlines of Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
</li><li> Other animals with quick-killing poisons and venoms include the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-ringed_octopus">blue-ringed octopodes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the <em>Hapalochlaena</em> genus, as well as many varieties of cone snails and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_dart_frog">poison dart frogs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, all of which can kill within minutes if you touch them (except poison dart frogs, which can only kill you if the poison is ingested or enters the bloodstream through a cut or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonedWeapons">poison dart</a>). In fact, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conus_geographus">Conus geographicus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> is nicknamed the "cigarette snail" because its victims are said to only have enough time to smoke a cigarette before they die.
<ul><li> However, the toxins from poison dart frogs are far from perfect—they work by paralysing muscles, including those used for breathing. While this means they are quickly fatal if untreated, a victim can be kept alive by artificial or mouth-to-mouth respiration and will recover entirely in a few hours as the poison wears off. The same also applies to blue-ringed octopuses, but the main difficulty with them is that they're so small and don't have an immediately painful bite, so it's hard to tell someone has even been envenomated before it's too late to keep them alive.
</li></ul></li><li> Pufferfish (<em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraodontidae">Tetraodontidae<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>) deserve a mention here too. As per this trope, the symptoms appear almost immediately after the meat is eaten. First, the victim's lips and tongue go numb. Then come the dizziness and vomiting, followed by rapid heart rate, lowered blood pressure, numbness all over the body, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">paralysis until death comes four to twenty-four hours later</a>. Poisoning someone with pufferfish meat (or <em>fugu</em> in Japanese) wouldn't be particularly practical, though. The only people allowed to serve <em>fugu</em> are licensed chefs, and even if a <em>fugu</em> poisoning was passed off as an accident, it would almost certainly lead to public shame and a revocation of the chef's license. (Unfortunately, in Thailand, pufferfish meat is often served in lieu of other fish because it's cheaper and because fewer people there are aware of the danger.)
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_laboratory_of_the_Soviet_secret_services">poison laboratory of the Soviet secret services<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> created a poison gas called carbylamine-choline-chloride, or C-2. It was said to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SovietSuperscience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SovietSuperscience">odorless, tasteless, and could not be detected autopsy, yet was potent enough</a> to kill within <em>fifteen minutes.</em> Eyewitnesses claimed that the gas also caused victims to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationHorror">physically change</a>, withering away and becoming quieter and calmer before death.
</li><li> Succinylcholine—sux for short—is a drug used as a muscle relaxant in surgery. Because sux is processed by the body quickly, there have been cases where people have used it to commit murder by inducing respiratory arrest in the victim.
</li><li> There is no such thing as a universal test for poisoning, only a series of tests to detect if a certain category of pharmaceutical is in the victim's system. Thus, if a poisoner can find a toxin in a category the local coroner is unlikely to test for without good reason (running tests costs time and money), and administer it without giving anyone reason to check for said category of toxin, then they have found an effectively undetectable poison.
