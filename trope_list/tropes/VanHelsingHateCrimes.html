<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin">Witch Hunter Robin</a></em> does this a lot in the second season. Every witch encountered by Robin thus far has gone power mad and evil...but then she begins encountering witches who engage in moral shades of gray and, finally, witches who are guilty of nothing but being picked out by her organization. And <em>they're</em> the humane ones; it's implied organizations outside of Japan kill witches flat-out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the only reason her organization keeps witches around is to produce the magic suppressor "Orbo" from their bodies</span>. In one episode, it's implied that the organization systematically destroyed the career, marriage, and finances of a potential witch who had never even used his powers. Destitute, he's forced to use his power to defend himself from some thugs and is taken in, put through some kind of magic lie-detector, and given the choice to admit he is evil and join them or die for using his powers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> plays on this occasionally; all humans fear youkai and hanyo, but not all youkai and hanyo want to hurt humans. This trope is even inverted with a villain who is convinced that all humans want to hurt demons.
<ul><li> One example is the "Spider-Head" arc, where the girl Nazuna exhibits considerable prejudice towards Inuyasha and Shippo, despite Inuyasha having saved her from a fall, though she realizes and accepts that not all youkai are bad by the end.
</li><li> Then there's Jinenji, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> hanyo who is constantly bullied for being a hanyo. When people in his village are discovered eaten, he is immediately the prime suspect to their eyes, and the true culprit, a nest of insect demons, is only revealed to the villagers <em>after</em> said villagers form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">an angry mob</a> and burn Jinenji's house to the ground. Having realized their error by the end, the villagers help Jinenji and his mother rebuild their hut as an apology.
</li><li> In another episode, they meet a morally gray demon hunter who condemns Rin and the humans in Inuyasha's group for even associating with demons/youkai and half-demons/hanyou, going so far as to brand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">Kagome</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonSlaying">Sango</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher">Miroku</a> hypocrites for doing so. Unlike Nazuna and the people in Jinenji's village, he doesn't learn any lesson by the end.
</li><li> Even the young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMonsterGirl">hanyou-girl</a> Shiori was badly treated and marginalized by the other villagers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">Even the children</a> threw them to the ground and beat them up.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, the Catholic-founded Iscariot Organisation sees vampires as an abomination and affront to God that needs to be wiped out, even the vampires that are hunting other vampires for the sake of humanity. It loses its edge, however, when you consider that, until Seras came along, there was only one such vampire, a sociopathic slaughter machine by the name of Alucard who is only held back by a very mortal woman.
</li><li> The Demon Slayers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OmamoriHimari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OmamoriHimari">Omamori Himari</a></em> seemingly want to eradicate all Ayakashi, with minor exceptions (currently only one) like the Amakawa family, who have some Ayakashi as servants.
</li><li> In contrast with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin">Karin</a></em>, vampires usually only take enough blood to make the person feel anemic and drained of emotion (which can actually be a <em>good</em> thing, if a person has a lot of negative emotions). So it's not surprising that Vampire Hunters are portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templars</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>:
<ul><li> Monsters have isolated their population centers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">disguise themselves as human</a> so that they can survive alongside them. In particular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Witches</a> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InferredHolocaust">so suffered</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">persecution</a> and habitat loss, some other monsters essentially consider them an endangered species.
</li><li> Witches suffer from this in <em>both</em> directions, because many monsters are prejudiced against them for being "almost human".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has Ichigo and co. acting like this when they meet Nel Tu and the others. Ichigo comes very close to killing the Hollows, which is understandable, due to the Hollows chasing Nel as a game of tag. Once the misunderstanding is cleared up, they join forces, despite the previously-held belief that Hollows were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>. Apparently, the Hollows are just mostly chaotic evil.
<ul><li> Subverted when it turns out that the "Hollows" are actually Arrancar (basically ascended Hollows) and Nel's underlings. Hollows are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, but Arrancar have free will and individual personalities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HellTeacherNube">Hell Teacher Nube</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperMaster">Paper Master</a> exorcist Yang Kailen who vowed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CynicismCatalyst">exterminate all supernatural creatures because of his dead little sister</a>, eventually arrives at Domori looking for the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai-killing</a> weapon: Nube's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Oni left hand</a>. Along the way, he massacres and violently slaughters innocent, benevolent, cheerful, and divine creatures that Nube was friends with.
</li><li> Izuna, the amateur exorcist, also had a bit of this going when she first met the Sorcerer Kitsune <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Tamamo</a> and the Snow Maiden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Yukime</a>. But these two are <em>far</em> beyond her level and handily humiliated her before Nube set her straight. Unlike Yang Kailen, though, Izuna is a lot more open minded (she keeps and breeds her own Tube Foxes) and gets over herself.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nube's father</span> is also guilty of this, to the point of attacking Yukime <em>on sight</em> merely because she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> and he's an exorcist.
</li></ul></li><li> Once it's clear demons are infiltrating human society in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Devilman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Devilman">Devilman</a></em>, humans start military actions against them. The problem is that they don't know about, and later don't believe in, Devilmen—humans who bonded with demons and retained their good nature—killing them alongside real demons. They're also willing to kill anyone even suspected of being a demon (defined as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchHunt">anyone who is unsatisfied with society</a>) and those accused of helping them. The big irony is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ringleader and instigator of the hunt, Ryo Asuka, is himself the king of all demons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>, who was trying to tear down human society so demons may rule again</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/WitchHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/WitchHunter">Witch Hunter</a></em>, the whole plot was kick-started when a new religion speaking out against Witches, a group of women who are able to wield supernatural powers, started wide scale witch hunts, killing countless innocent witches. In answer to this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">North and South</a>, two of the most powerful witches—who are without a doubt sadistic warmongerers who enjoy carnage—and their followers started their own genocide against humanity, killing almost 2/3 of all humans on <em>Earth</em>. The world scale organization humans formed to combat these witches <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverts</a> this trope by having made it their mission to <em>limit</em> witch deaths, instead capturing them alive and draining their magic, which has proven to be the reason so many of the humanity-hating ones are insane in the first place. They even employ and protect witches who are willing to fight for humanity and are, in fact, the only organization that treats humans and witches as equals.
<ul><li> Any character in the series who wholeheartedly believes all witches should be killed, or simply kills witches for revenge, is clearly painted in the narrative as being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> for it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>, the titular beings are just as varied in their morality as ordinary humans. While there are many that are brutal sadists that enjoy killing humans, many others seek to find ways to live peacefully with humans as much as is possible. The story portrays both sides, sharing time between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">moderates</a> of Anteiku and the Ghoul Investigators of CCG. As such, we get to see many peaceful Ghouls that live in constant fear for their lives and have lost most (if not all) of their families to the investigators. In particular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabidCop">Kureo</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Mado</a> sees nothing wrong with brutalizing Ghouls and expresses disgust at them "imitating" human feelings like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">maternal love</a> or compassion. He hunts down a mother and daughter living quietly in the peaceful 20th Ward by taking advantage of their superior sense of smell and lures the daughter with "Daddy's scent". He also taunts the mother for being unable to fight before killing her with a weapon made from her husband. And he laughs with sadistic glee when he brings both weapons made from the parents to bear against their <em>daughter</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YoukaiShoujoMonsuga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YoukaiShoujoMonsuga">Youkai Shoujo Monsuga</a></em>, the organization G-CUP tries to recruit the protagonist Nishizuru Yakki due to his powerful supernatural abilities. He opposes them after he learns they are dedicated to killing <em>all</em> youkai — viewing them as abominations and threats to humanity regardless of whether or not they kill humans — and that the good youkai he has befriended are on their hit list.
</li><li> Discussed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em>. Panty and Stocking's "job" is to kill Ghosts, creatures mostly borne out of the spite of dead and living humans, which are almost always sadistic and destructive. <em>Almost</em>, we find, since one particular Ghost happens to be not only harmless, but a beloved member of the human community. When he is found dead, the public demands that the culprit be prosecuted, and the prime suspects are Panty and Stocking. Although they did not do it, nobody believes them, since even they openly admit that they usually attack Ghosts on sight (although the Ghosts they kill are always causing some sort of trouble). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the end, this is subverted: the actual culprit was the Ghost's wife, and the whole "hate crime" story was fed and spun out of control by the Daemon sisters, who sought to frame the heroines and get them the death penalty.</span>

Our protagonist happens to be born into one of those races, which understandably leaves him with a very negative opinion of the church and their god.
</li><li> Discussed, Defied and Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoblinSlayer">Goblin Slayer</a></em>. Right at the end of the first arc, Priestess expressed her disturbance at Goblin Slayer's willingness to kill goblin children, citing this trope. Goblin Slayer would have none of it, even proclaiming that 'the only good goblins are the ones who never leave their holes', and judging from how every single goblin depicted so far are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> bastards who would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a>, he would not (and <em>should</em> not) take that chance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobPsycho100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobPsycho100">Mob Psycho 100</a></em>, the titular Mob is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">exceptionally powerful</a> young psychic who has been taught not to use his powers on humans, but works part-time as an exorcist and thus has no problem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">exterminating spirits</a>. Most of those being cartoonishly evil vengeful ghosts hostile to humanity, this initially doesn't seem like a problem... until Mob and his mentor, Reigen, encounter a family of ghosts who just want to spend their unlife in peace. This ends up causing some moral conundrums for both of them.

The problem was, she neither knew nor cared that there were two factions of robots, and that one of them was trying to <em>help</em> the humans.

Rason was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenAngel">banished from heaven</a> because he saved a female monster from an evil human. It took Rason's efforts to save Luna and Falla from his fellow angels in Act IV, as well as direct interference from God Himself, to get the angels to start thinking differently, and by the end, they've realized and accepted that not all monsters are bad.
</li><li> The Human Defense Agency, or HDA, that came into being after Alucard's attack and the subsequent exposure of monsters, is also fairly quick to write off all monsters as evil simply because of the actions of a few people, with one soldier flat-out telling Moka and Akasha to their faces that, as far as he's concerned, monsters like them aren't even animals.

When James Edwards (Jay) went into the final round, they were given target practice. All the other candidates, who seemed to view all the cut-out alien targets as basically monsters, shot only aliens and refused to shoot any human targets; they were all rejected. Edwards did not shoot any of the aliens, for example because one was simply clearly working out while another was blowing its nose, and shot only the target of the little human girl at the end, because she was carrying a book on quantum mechanics down a street filled with scary-looking aliens in the middle of the night and therefore appeared out of place and highly suspicious.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TanyaHuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TanyaHuff">Tanya Huff</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodBooks">Blood Trail</a></em> centers around this. The protagonist is called in to discover who's been murdering the local pack of werewolves; it turns out to be a religious neighbor who'd discovered their nature and decided to do God's work by killing the soulless abominations. When one of them saves his life, he realizes how badly he was mistaken and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">unable to deal with it</a>, kills himself.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDraculaTape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDraculaTape">The Dracula Tape</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredSaberhagen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FredSaberhagen">Fred Saberhagen</a>, where Dracula is a mostly harmless individual who's harassed by the Harkers (who are clueless) and Van Helsing (who's a religious fanatic). Which means that is a case of a Van Helsing Hate Crime committed by... Van Helsing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> loves to play with this trope, given that it's a fantasy series and also a detective serial, so they are obligated to use every "things are not always as they seem" in the book:
<ul><li> Played Straight: Harry's interactions with the vampires can initially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and later literally</span> be called "genocidal", but later in the series, it's made clear that they are not necessarily evil or even harmful, with several vampires of various types joining his list of regular contacts.
<ul><li> It's worth mentioning that there are several types of vampires in the Dresdenverse: the Black Court are unholy abominations against life itself, the Red Court are demons in human suits, and the White Court are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">Emotion Eaters</a>. Most of his contacts are in the White Court, since they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonhuman">much more human</a> than the other types of vampires.
</li><li> It's also worth mentioning that Red Court vamps can only become full vampires by killing a human and drinking their lifeblood. So <em>every</em> Red Court vamp has committed at least one murder, and probably a whole lot more than one. However, the intent behind said killing seems to be irrelevant: one Red Court vampire (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Susan</span>) turns after killing a man whom she had just learned was responsible for her daughter being kidnapped and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">almost used as a human sacrifice</span>.
</li><li> It is more that the White Court prefer to rule through subterfuge and manipulation. The Black Court want to kill and slaughter and the Red Court want to subjugate through force (and are at war with the Council). So the White Court are definitely still, by and large, evil and dangerous. But in a manner that is a "lesser of two evils" kind of way.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted: The Knights of the Cross, called by God to hunt evil and defend the innocent, are actually quite reasonable, understanding people who take the stance that redemption is within anyone's reach, human or monster.

Since Neville was unaware of their presence, and he's been slaughtering vampires indiscriminately for <em>years</em>, he's slain a large number of the good vampires.

When Alexander and Enid Healy, monster hunters born into the Covenant, discovered the effects that the thoughtless extermination of cryptids was having on the environment (the extirpation of unicorns from Britain is cited as the cause for the great cholera epidemic), they immediately quit and moved to America. The blood feud didn't <em>really</em> heat up until their great-granddaughter Alice married the agent sent to see if they were harmless, persuading him to quit in the process. The Prices only kill cryptids if there's no other option to protect the environment, instead of the Covenant's heedless approach.
</li><li> The Palatine Guard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegCabot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MegCabot">Meg Cabot</a>'s <em>Insatiable</em> series see nothing wrong with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackBauerInterrogationTechnique">torturing</a> a captive vampire, especially since nothing short of outright killing one would leave any evidence. Alaric Wulf, one such Guard, repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">makes the argument</a> that since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> who gravely injured his partner is a vampire, he is fully justified in summarily killing any and all vampires he meets, and any human who dares harbor one. In the first book, during the climactic battle against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and his minions, the Palatine Guard repeatedly shoot the vampire protagonist Lucien in the back (he survives because he is just that badass).

</li><li> A major plot point in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville">Kitty Norville</a></em> series. It takes place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnmasquedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnmasquedWorld">The Unmasqued World</a>, and a lot of people aren't happy to know that werewolves and vampires (and a lot of other things) are out there. At least four of the novels so far have featured normal humans treating Kitty like she's a monster, from accusing her of mauling cows with no evidence of it to trying to kill her.
<ul><li> Kitty herself came out of the closet due to a hired monster hunter attacking her on air in the first book.
</li><li> In the <em>second</em> book; a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> Christians kidnapped her on the day of a full moon, shoved her into a room painted with silver, pointed a camera at her, and then hijacked all the local airwaves. Their goal was to show that werewolves and the like were monsters and needed to be exterminated. Problem was that Kitty, instead of attacking everything, curled up in the corner and whimpered as she was in so much pain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">So instead of seeing a blood thirsty beast the world saw a woman kidnapped, forced to undergo a transformation she had no control over, and then tortured by a bunch of religious extremists.</a> The ringleader, a <em>United States senator</em>, as a desperate last move grabbed a guy and forced his arm through the bars for Kitty to maul. She wasn't tempted.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LonelyWerewolfGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LonelyWerewolfGirl">Lonely Werewolf Girl</a></em> books, the guild of Werewolf Hunters has no backstory to explain exactly why they are hunting werewolves, so tends to come across as this. Especially since their targets include a fashion designer, a pair of tourists, a pair of punk singers, and their manager.
</li><li> Funnily enough, a major theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonsterBloodTattoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonsterBloodTattoo">Monster Blood Tattoo</a></em> - Rossamund bringing the issue up with Europe (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheWhoFightsMonsters">She Who Fights Monsters</a> (<a class="urllink" href="https://xkcd.com/725/">literally<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)) is a major catalyst for their character development.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonsterHunterInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonsterHunterInternational">Monster Hunter International</a></em> novels, pretty much every monster race is considered a threat to humanity to be hunted down and killed for a bounty on sight. To be fair, most of them are. But the government steps on the rights of those who have proven themselves civilized whenever it suits them to. Most notably, every time a major war breaks out, someone in the DOD revokes the PUFF exemption of Earl Harbinger (a 100 year old werewolf, and one of the few who has genuine control of his actions at full moon) so that they can force him to earn a new one by serving a tour of duty in a special forces unit, despite having no genuine grounds to do so.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em>, this was a long time common among the shadowhunters. They have hunted and killed the downworlders for little or no reason at all. According to Jace, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">a great step</a> to consider downworlders as like humans, rather than like demons.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress">Night Huntress</a></em> is convinced that all vampires are bloodsucking demons. After she learns that not all of them are evil, she realizes that some of the vampires she killed may just have been looking for a snack and a one night stand, and killing them may not have been self-defense.

It doesn't help that he's part of the <strike> dark</strike> <em>Light</em> side, and in this universe, you can't switch sides.
</li><li> In <em>Nyctophobia</em>, this is part of the backstory of the man himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Bram Van Helsing</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">The Professor's son was killed by a werewolf and his wife's mind was shattered by the event</a>, so it's no surprise he joined Nyctophobia to exterminate monsters.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series includes a tribe of wolf shapeshifters whose magic is intended to help them protect humanity from vampires. Their relationship with the Cullen family, who have vowed to consume only animal blood, is tense, especially in Breaking Dawn<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, where Jacob narrowly averts open warfare, then later almost starts the war himself. Then once Jacob imprints with Renesmee, he and the other werewolves stand back and allow humans to be slaughtered by several visiting vampires just because said vampires are willing to protect Renesmee from the Vampire Council.</span>.

Some of them have gone to prison when their would be victims called the cops on the strangers in town with too many guns and explosives and not enough permits.

The werewolves think of the hunters as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>.
</li><li> Vampire hunters are a major enemy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUnitedStatesOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheUnitedStatesOfMonsters">The United States of Monsters</a></em> as they serve as domestic terrorists in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnmasquedWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnmasquedWorld">The Unmasqued World</a>.

Trying to convince Van Helsing that he only drank animal blood wasn't very effective. In story, his type of vampire is compared to a hunting dog vs Dracula's vicious wolf.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> dealt with this trope head-on in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E03ThatOldGangOfMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS03E03ThatOldGangOfMine">That Old Gang of Mine</a>", when it turned out that Gunn's old demon-slaying gang had started turning its sights on <em>all</em> demons, no matter how harmless they were. This appears to have been mostly out of boredom after the vampire nest they had used to fight was wiped out.
<ul><li> As the series progressed, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> became like a Gothic version of <em>Star Trek</em> in a lot of ways, in the sense that <em>demon</em> was a catchall word which described a <em>lot</em> of different species; and though plenty of them were evil, in some cases, the word <em>demon</em> didn't rightfully imply anything negative about them at all. In the case of characters like Lorne and (later) Illyria, the value-neutral term <em>extraterrestrial</em> would have been a lot more appropriate.
<ul><li> Illyria probably is 'evil', or was originally. Or at least was Cthulhu, completely uncaring about lesser species and seeing them, at best, as pawns, if she saw them at all. It's just she doesn't understand the new world at all, and is without (most of) her powers and followers. Even all of her enemies are dead. She's only 'good' because the other people willing to explain things to her insist she behave in a certain way.
</li></ul></li><li> Holtz, who—well, suffice to say, Angel's vampirism is only Holtz's <em>second</em> most pressing reason for wanting him dead. Holtz is fully aware of Angel's curse, but, unlike most other characters, he denies that this makes any ethical difference: "I will never agree that he has somehow been absolved from the past by the presence of his soul." Given his historical timeframe, this is pretty accurate for Holtz. Angel and Angelus are, essentially, the same being to him. That Angel feels bad is fine and good, but it's really up to God to forgive him if God feels Angel's suffered enough. Until then, Angelus has escaped mortal judgment time and again and is still an abomination.
</li><li> Holtz's attitude is actually very similar to Angel's own—both consider Angel responsible for what he did as Angelus. It's just that Angel is trying to make up for it while Holtz thinks he needs to die. Angel can never really make the claim that Holtz is <em>wrong</em> for pursuing his vendetta. He doesn't even try.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS01E09Hero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS01E09Hero">Hero</a>", a gang of demons arrive in LA and start killing "abominations": any demon who is even slightly human or half human, like one of the main characters, Doyle, or any vampire at all. According to the previous <em>Buffy</em> finale, they weren't purebloods themselves, either. The Nazi analogy isn't all that subtle, is it? This is <em>the</em> Angel theme. Some monsters aren't so bad!
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS02E01Judgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS02E01Judgment">Judgment</a>" has him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">kill the last defender of a pregnant woman</a>, who was a Buddhist monk to boot. Until he takes up the role himself (protector, not Buddhist monk).
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Beetleborgs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Beetleborgs">Beetleborgs</a></em>, a young vampire hunter attempts to slay Count Fangula, who is actually quite harmless and poses no danger to anyone in the nearby town, due to his incompetence. After the vampire hunter is scared by Flabber, disguised as a dragon, he proclaims Fangula to be an insignificant vampire, being more trouble than he is worth, thus allowing Fangula to live.
</li><li> Father Kemp of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em> has no qualms about killing most of Bristol's vampire population, kills werewolves under the guise of helping them, and forcibly exorcises ghosts. He does this in spite of a good number of them actually being decent people just trying to live a normal life, to the point that he is incapable of considering the idea that the vampire Mitchell could form a genuinely platonic relationship with werewolf George.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigWolfOnCampus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigWolfOnCampus">Big Wolf on Campus</a></em>, "Muffy the Werewolf Slayer" showed up, intending to hunt down and kill the protagonist; she was eventually convinced that, no, honest, <strike>Angel</strike> Tommy was a <em>good</em> <strike>vampire</strike> werewolf, though she found the concept pretty freaky. (Every other werewolf seen on the show is at minimum a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> and more likely a man-eating psychopath, so her surprise is understandable.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> mostly ignores this in the earlier seasons, until it is tackled head-on with the Initiative in season 4. They lump every non-human under 'evil', even going as far as experimenting on an untransformed, conscious werewolf. Riley, a member of the Initiative, makes negative comments about Oz being a werewolf, leading to Buffy angrily calling him a bigot. However, when the Initiative began to do the experiments mentioned above, he snaps out of it. In the episode "Phases" Buffy goes up against a werewolf hunter who sees nothing wrong with the fact that a werewolf is human most of the time (all day every day and all but three nights out of 28 or 29), but he is more of an amoral, greedy monster hunter than a bigoted, fanatical monster hunter.

</li></ul></li><li> The Hunters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf">Teen Wolf</a></em> seem to go this route more often then not. Although in theory they have a Code that restricts them to hunting only werewolves that harm humans, most of them seem to have little problem with ignoring it and killing any werewolves they find. They have actually developed such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">self-righteous attitude</a> towards their mission that they are even willing to torture and kill ordinary humans if it suits their goals, whether those humans actually have anything to do with werewolves or not. Combined with how well-equipped they are and the way that they generally outgun their victims by a wide margin, this creates the impression that they are thrill-killers rather than protectors of humanity.
<ul><li> Their willingness to tolerate Scott is due to a complicated mix of him being a minor, not having killed anyone, and being important to Allison. Even so, this is a very tenuous tolerance, as shown by Gerard stabbing Scott in the gut and Victoria trying to murder him because they were still dating despite having been ordered to break up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em> is a HBO series based upon the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSookieStackhouseMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSookieStackhouseMysteries">The Sookie Stackhouse Mysteries</a></em> novels by Charlaine Harris.

</li><li> The UK miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraviolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Ultraviolet">Ultraviolet</a></em> centers around the moral progression of the main character after he kills his friend-turned-vampire and joins up with the people hunting them. According to them, vampires, or Code Fives, are a "public health problem" who must be neutralized before they can organize any further. When it's revealed that the Code Fives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">don't actually murder their prey, but, even more importantly, are close to designing viable synthetic blood</span>, Michael's role begins to change.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVampireDiaries">The Vampire Diaries</a></em> plays with this a great deal—on a few occasions, ruthless vampires framed more peaceful ones for their crimes and let the town's indiscriminate Council kill them. Of particular notice is Bill Forbes, who actually tortured his own daughter in an attempt to teach her not to be a vampire. More recently, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the repeated deaths of Alaric Saltzman allowed the ancient witch Esther to turn him into one of these, to the extent that he brutally murdered other Council members for their failure to kill every vampire</span>.
<ul><li> Used towards the end of Season 1 with the Founders Council and in particular with "Uncle John"'s arrival in town—mainly as he was such an unsympathetic jerkass. May be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> as some, if not most, of the vampires really are amoral killers that need to be put down, and even the 'good' ones can go off the rails on occasions. Compare with other vampire shows where this trope is taken even further.
<ul><li> Mind you, part of the problem with Uncle John is that he seems prepared to team up with some of the nastiest vampires out there to kill off friendlier ones... and is prepared to risk humans for a chance to kill vampires.

His books on ghosts, werebeasts, witches, and Vistani address the possibility that a "monster" may be inoffensive and/or unwilling; other Ravenloft monsters are so irredeemably evil and destructive that the hate crimes are justified in their case.

<ul><li> It is not as much as being a correct response, but the sheer cost of a possible mistake. Missing s single Chaos worshiper or a Genestealer hybrid can cause entire planets or even star systems to be overrun. When the safety of billions depend on your decision, you are not allowed to take any chances.
</li><li> It's also a question of sheer scale; there are far more planets in the Imperium than there are Inquisitors, it's often easier and cheaper to depopulate and resettle an area than to face whatever might be getting established there, and the local authorities usually don't have the clearance to know that the things the Inquisition fights are even possible. The Imperium prides itself on counting the lives of planets, not men, and frankly they can't even keep track of that since they're conquered and lost so frequently.
</li></ul></li><li> Witch hunters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WitchGirlsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WitchGirlsAdventures">Witch Girls Adventures</a></em> range from comparatively decent sorts who try to target witches that are actually a problem for people and are willing to let children off with a warning, to the Malleus Maleficarum, who take Van Helsing Hate Crimes into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> territory, being perfectly willing to kill (relatively) harmless witches and children, and whose ultimate goal is the complete genocide of witches. The problem is that, due to abysmal setting-building, witches come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic">so innately monstrous</a> that the Maleficarum's policy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> seems like the only sane reaction, given that witches are portrayed as universally selfish monsters who are outright encouraged to mutilate and kill people as they see fit for the pettiest of reasons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>. Despite supplements that directly oppose this, many gamers assume that Evil=Ok to kill, with or without another reason.
<ul><li> Some supplements that oppose the idea of killing evil do so by assigning the evil alignment (in terms of a statistics block) to characters who are in no way evil in thought or deed. So they don't really oppose the idea that evil = okay to kill so much as they dispense with any meaning behind the terms "good" and "evil" beyond how they affect spell mechanics.
</li><li> In older versions of D&amp;D, "Lawful" implied good and "Chaotic" implied evil. "Old School" D&amp;D derivative <em>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</em> uses Lawful to mean "assigned a destiny by higher powers" and Chaotic to mean "aware of incomprehensibly powerful cosmic forces that could engulf our world any day now". There's no moral code or philosophy attached to either alignment; spells that detect "good" or "evil" merely detect entanglement with these powers/forces, although characters may not see it that way. Notably, all Clerics are Lawful and all Magic-Users (and Elves, who use MU spells) are Chaotic.
</li><li> A slightly less common, but still all too regular occurrence, is for players to forget that there aren't actually all that many races that are <em>all</em> Evil. Killing evil without other provocation may be borderline, but killing someone without provocation because you wrongly assume that they are evil...
</li><li> The Eberron setting comes flat out and says that there are no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> races (well, <em>maybe</em> the daelkyr). An orc or goblin is about as likely to be a respectable merchant as a bloodthirsty savage, and the elves are xenophobic semi-necromancers (which, again, doesn't <em>automatically</em> mean "evil"). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> is still a thing, of course, but it's no longer a justified trope. Dragons are also no longer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColorCodedForYourConvenience">Color-Coded for Your Convenience</a>.

</li><li> Sometimes the choice of if this Trope is applicable or not can vary from house to house, party or party, or even by different members in the <em>same</em> party. If you murder a room full of babies that are part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> race, is that a hate crime or is it justified since they are "born" evil?

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Forsaken complain about the Alliance not making much of a distinction between them and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Scourge</a>, an attitude that drove them to join the Horde.

</li><li> The Worgen of Gilneas have a bit of this as well. Most Worgen are beasts, though often cunning ones, while the Gilneans have found a way to retain a human mind. The people of the town of Darkshire, however, still see the Worgen on a whole as monsters to be exterminated, so the Gilnean Worgen who maintain their non-human forms have set up their base some ways away from the actual town and those within it maintain a human form around the locals.
</li><li> The Scarlet Crusade, a band of zealots who are determined to wipe out all undead. However their zealotry is so extreme that any living being not of their order are considered to be potential carriers of the plague and must be eliminated to halt the Scourge's growth.
</li></ul></li><li> A low-level version of this is kind of a running theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>. Playable characters (particularly Reimu) tend to attack youkai just for being youkai (and the majority are reasonably decent people). It's even pretty much the entire reason that the 12th game happened (except for Marisa, who just thought it would be interesting). On the other hand, combat is non-lethal, and some oddball metaphysics makes conflict between humans and youkai necessary, so...
</li><li> Shades of this appear in later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> games; the Maverick Hunters dutifully destroy any Reploid that goes "Maverick", according to their standards... which would be fine, if those standards were limited to those Reploids actively infected with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> or deliberately causing grievous harm to humanity and/or Reploidkind. Unfortunately, it seems to encompass <em>any</em> form of resistance against the natural order of things, including otherwise non-hostile acts like exiling themselves to their own space colony (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4">Mega Man X4</a></em>), or merely having traits that could potentially cause problems with controlling them (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6">Mega Man X6</a></em>). In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">it's revealed in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em> that the Maverick Hunter commander in charge during <em>X4</em> retired in disgrace for <em>mis</em>applying the label of "Maverick" on Repliforce, and thus causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent Reploids.
<ul><li> The Repliforce incident was something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> with regard to this. Repliforce, standing accused of destroying a city, not only refuses to come in for questioning to help clear their names, but also spouts some nonsensical self-entitled military philosophy as justification (Colonel himself acts like being asked to disarm before coming in for questioning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">is a bigger disgrace than the city-destroying accusations</a>), instead of raising more legitimate concerns like fear of being scapegoated. Adding to their actions during the course of the game (launching a coup, occupying several cities, Storm Owl terrorizing the skies in a space fortress, and Jet Stingray destroying a city... the last one being exactly what they were framed for and causing them to be declared Maverick in the first place, not to mention Magma Dragoon also betraying the Maverick Hunters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">solely to fight X or Zero</a>), painting Repliforce as unfortunate victims of an unfair government just seems like whitewashing.
</li><li> An often overlooked but crucial detail is that X and Zero (and Axl) give them a choice. They always come asking for cooperation or surrender <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">and are refused each time</a>, with even those not driven insane by a virus acting just as unhinged in their zeal to essentially murder police officers as those who <em>are</em> infected. Colonel refused every offer to stop the coup and surrender, as did all the rest of the Repliforce soldiers, and the only Reploid in <em>X5</em> who didn't want to waste time fighting was Squid Adler, who unfortunately succumbed to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Sigma Virus</a> immediately after agreeing to help them. One of the saddest cases was Rainy Turtloid, created by Gate who was given extremely durable armor for navigating through dangerous areas. He was feared for what he could do <em>if</em> he turned evil and Gate was punished for opposing the decision to weaken him so he'd be less of a potential threat. In the end, he took his own life so Gate wouldn't suffer further ramifications before being resurrected in <em>X6</em>. He said he knew where X or Zero was coming from (Gate now being insane), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">he couldn't bring himself to betray the one person who gave him a second chance.</a> For his part, X was shown to be horrified at the thought of fighting him.

However, Nier, in his tireless quest to save his daughter/sister, has ensured the extinction of humanity.

</li><li> Donovan Baine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darkstalkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darkstalkers">Darkstalkers</a></em> is a monster killer. In the opening to <em>Night Warriors</em>, he is shown targeting, in addition to definite bad apples like Huitzil and Lord Raptor, Felicia. Felicia is a perfectly nice, kind (almost innocent) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl">Cat Girl</a> who is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>. Yet Donovan still wants to kill her.
<ul><li> More explicitly an element of Bulleta/B.B. Hood's character. She kills monsters simply because she's greedy and sadistic, gleefully targeting even harmless fellow cast members for death. Her ending even involves her preparing to murder a pair of innocent wolf demons who are already terrified of her from the monster news reports of her indiscriminate slaughter.
</li><li> The UDON comic adaptation depicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl">Cat Girls</a> (like Felicia) as an offshoot of humanity often lumped in with more hell-raising types of monster.

Rachni seem like just your regular monster, wreaking havoc on the research facility on Noveria, but it turns out they're sentient and somewhat intelligent and only attacking because the research that was done on them drove them insane. The Thorian that terrorizes colonists on Feros is a debatable example: yes, it distrusts humanoids after it was double-crossed by Saren, but it's quite clear that before then it only had a use for humanoids as slaves or fertilizer. And even the geth get enough sympathy in the sequel that just shooting them on sight like we'd been accustomed to isn't as justified as we thought.
<ul><li> The second and third game make it clear that the geth have been on the receiving end of this from the quarians for over three hundred years. Legion reveals that despite desperately wanting to make peace with their Creators, they cannot understand why whenever they try to stop fighting, the quarians respond by <em>immediately</em> opening fire, forcing the geth to once again defend themselves.

You have to kill Colossi to advance the story, but it's heavily implied that at least some of them are perfectly peaceful and they don't deserve to die.

For their part, the one agent of the Church met in the game acknowledges that Arcueid is not (currently) evil and doesn't even drink blood, but considers her enough of a <em>potential</em> threat that she feels justified in trying to kill her anyway. Then again, Arcueid is something of an anomaly in being a human-friendly vampire; pretty much every other vampire mentioned is evil, or at least uncaring about human life. In fact, most of the reason the Church doesn't pick fights with Arcueid more often is because they know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">how powerful she is</a>, and are aware that only the most elite of their elite agents would even have a prayer of surviving against her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins">Goblins</a>: Life Through Their Eyes</em> is built on this trope. It takes place in a universe where the traditionally evil races of D&amp;D are *not* always chaotic evil, but still have their traditional reputation. Enough fantastic racism is in place that the "good" races are perfectly willing to slaughter them now and cast spells that reveal alignment never. To drive the point home, it introduces members of the "good" races, such as Kore, Dellyn Goblinslayer, and Saral Caine, who are amoral at best and far more vile than any characters from the "evil" races at worst. Kore is a paladin who kills a dwarven child because prolonged contact with "evil" contaminated him, and Dellyn's actions sicken even Min-Max, a brainless fighter who (at the time) had no problem killing monsters.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a> is determined to contain every abnormal being they come across, even if they're completely harmless. One of its rival organizations, the Global Occult Coalition, plays this straighter, as they are dedicated to <em>destroying</em> every SCP they can find.
<ul><li> Partly subverted in that "contain" has a flexible meaning based on just how harmless a given SCP is. For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">SCP-682</a>, "contain" means "keep in vat of concentrated sulfuric acid so as to prevent 682 from murdering humanity"; for the tickle monster that once managed to subdue 682, it just means "keep fed and happy".
</li><li> Some, like SCP-085 (the 2D woman) and SCP-507 (the Dimensional Shifter), are quite friendly with staff members. 507 even gets (monitored) internet access.
</li><li> Others (the every-drink-ever machine) get put in the break room. Under <em>heavy</em> observation, in case someone orders a cup of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">antimatter</a>.
</li><li> As a general rule of writing, an SCP has to fit into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">Cosmic Horror Story</a> tone of the series in <em>some</em> way, and, as such, anyone who doesn't deserve to be detained (like the aforementioned SCP-507) is generally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> and <em>very glad</em> they stay somewhere with a lot of doctors on hand. The Foundation doesn't hate anomalies—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">they're just not allowed to go free</a>.
</li><li> Even the Global Occult Coalition is implied to not be as bad as the Foundation makes them out to be. It's sometimes heavily implied the whole "kill every SCP they come across" is just the Foundation's <em>opinion</em> of them and they have deeper goals and interests.
<ul><li> GOC's policy towards the anomalous may actually be closer to "join us or die", as unlike the Foundation, the GOC is much more willing to employ anomalous humans and make use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> to fight against anomalies.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em>, there's the ongoing conflict between Carmilla and the Reverend Darren Englund and his student posse. So far, he's been behind at least two attempts on her life. (To be fair, Sara is generally depicted as one of the good guys right now, but it's easy to see why even characters rather less fanatic than Englund might worry that there could be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> looming in her future—and as she's a budding cosmic entity, that would be decidedly bad news.) Even better, there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroSchool">Whateley</a> student named Nightbane. She's an Exemplar blonde and good religious girl whose powers are ideally suited to fighting creatures of the night. She's the bad guy, since she's trying very hard to kill Carmilla.
<ul><li> Carmilla's a descendant of Shub-Niggurath on her father's side and of Cthulhu on her mother's side. She is foretold to be the thing that wipes humanity off the face of the earth and replaces us with her spawn. As The Kellith, she has an evil cult that numbers in the thousands. She has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a> as well as Naughty Tentacles. Her closest (only?) living relative is a high-level supervillain known as the Necromancer. If there weren't stories told from her point of view, no one would think the Reverend and his monster hunters were in the wrong.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Humanity First, the Knights of Purity, elements within the MCO and their sympathizers within the police will commit hate crimes against vulnerable mutants if they think they can get away with it.

In the Doctor's defense, all of Duckula's previous incarnations were exactly as bad as he believes the current one is, and the only reason the current one is a decent bloke is a flaw in the resurrection ritual.
</li><li> An interesting variation of this trope occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>. While many of the supernatural entities the Ghostbusters came across were as evil and dangerous as one might typically expect and had to be busted in one way or another, sometimes the ghosts, vampires or other beings were, in fact, the ones who needed the Ghostbusters' help. Whether it was a family of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampires">suburban spirits hiring the Ghostbusters to get rid of the malign demons that infested their house</a>, ghosts who were causing trouble for the living but only needed the Ghostbusters' assistance to complete their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a> to be able to rest in peace, or a clan of vampires that fed on synthetic blood needing help with some overzealous vampire hunters who wanted to kill them even when they weren't a threat, the Ghostbusters could just as easily be helping the supernatural as fighting it.

While sometimes his targets are truly evil, sometimes he targets the (mostly) benign Grim Reaper, or other fairly harmless, kind-hearted supernatural being. He targets anything, really; at one point, he mentions he killed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">bunch of lawyers</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke">he thinks they're not human</a>.

(Human Against Magic), an organization that hunted monsters regardless of their alignment. They're not exactly fond of humans that help them either, a.k.a Juniper (though she is magically enhanced, so it falls under their range of targets).
</li><li> Happens a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em>. The species was almost wiped out by humans. In particular, there are the Hunters (Gillecomgain and the Canmores) and the Quarrymen (a modern hate-group spawned from the former). The Hunt began because of Demona, who actually is evil, but neither group bothers to distinguish her from all the perfectly normal, decent gargoyles who just want to be left alone. And the massacres had already driven gargoyles to the brink of extinction long before Demona's lifetime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a></em>: under the orders of Old George, the Forever Knights are out to hunt down every alien on Earth, regardless of whether they're good or bad. Understandably, it's a lot harder to find the bad ones, so the good ones get targeted. Argit was the only real bad guy they ever harassed. This lasted for one episode; Ben made it very clear that there would be lethal consequences for persisting, and they took his threat seriously. What's really strange is that Old George's command isn't even internally consistent. He has a very specific beef with an all-powerful alien, one to whom the target aliens were in no way related. Indeed, he is shown to not care that his subordinates have failed, which brings to mind the question of why he directed the resources of his organization to a meaningless task when his stated aim is to prevent the rise of one far worse.
<ul><li> Probably to keep them out of his way, mostly, it's not like he needed their help. So either he's being a somewhat nice guy (to fellow humans at least) and keeping them out of harm's way, or he knows they'd just get in his way, slow him down and pretty much be problems at best.
