This is related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">Conviction by Contradiction</a>, where a single thing wrong with an alibi is sufficient to prove guilt, but goes further: the key that makes the claim or alibi wrong is <em>itself</em> factually incorrect.
</p><p>For example, a guy's alibi is that he was caring for his pregnant mule, and he is immediately revealed to be lying, since mules can't get pregnant. We've got him! To the jail! Not so fast: while they're rare, fertile female mules <em>do</em> exist. Thus, there's a problem with this "revelation": it's simply <em>wrong</em>.
</p><p>When adding examples, keep in mind that a fact has to be <em>actually wrong</em> to qualify for Conviction by Counterfactual Clue. If there's simply a way to explain away the objection without calling <em>factual</em> rightness into question, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">Conviction by Contradiction</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>: The Moonlight Sonata case uses the belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">all women are physically weaker than all men</a>, as a foolproof alibi. Even when there's an elderly, overweight or disabled man in the room who doesn't get the same courtesy. A female doctor is written off as a suspect because she's petite with thin arms and couldn't have lifted the bodies. (Each of which are taller than her and would require quite a feat to move around the way they did.)

</li><li> A mildly confusing case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheKindaichiCaseFiles">The Kindaichi Case Files</a></em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Hajime reveals the culprit by pointing out that tomatoes are not fruits</a>. Some people can be forgiven if they yelled "tomatoes are fruits you idiots!"the truth is that while tomatoes are considered fruit in botanical terms (seeds, and all), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">they are considered vegetables in both culinary arts and most tax codes.</a>

<ul><li> In the 1980s and 1990s, the Swedish edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ThePhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ThePhantom">The Phantom</a></em> had a page of reader-submitted material, of which one of the more popular were crime mysteries (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">Conviction by Contradiction</a> for more details). One of these had the culprit give himself away by referring to the banana as a fruit. Even though banana trees are herbaceous plants, a banana is biologically considered a fruit. Even when using the culinary term for fruits (which is probably the term most people outside of the fields of biology, botany, and horticulture are familiar with), this still doesn't exactly excuse the conviction, as the banana is one of the most classic examples of a "Culinary Fruit." (For a more specific description, a culinary fruit is any edible fruit that is sweet. Biologically, a fruit is a plant structure that contains seeds. This is why things like tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and cucumbers are classified as fruits by botanists, but not by chefs.)
</li><li> The trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">invoked</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WelcomeToTranquility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WelcomeToTranquility">Welcome to Tranquility</a></em>. Emoticon is in jail and being questioned with regards to the murder of Mr. Articulate, a crime-solving member of the community who was legendary for his intellect, wit and long and storied history of traveling the world. However, Emoticon points out that a lot of the stories of his adventures were "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">culturally insensitive</a>", and he recounts one of the detective stories from Mr. Articulate's youth that always stuck in his mind: Mr. Articulate discovered the identity of the murderer because the "Korean" man at dinner left his chopsticks in his bowl of rice, something no actual Korean would do since it is a symbol for death and, therefore, he must not be Korean, but Japanese instead, and thusly the killer. However, Japanese culture has <em>the same custom</em>. "So the ending doesn't <em>work</em>. It's a <em>cheat</em>."
<ul><li> Of course, Koreans eat rice with a spoon, so there's one more reason it doesn't work. They eat other dishes with chopsticks.
</li></ul></li><li> The British "Adult" comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Viz">Viz</a></em> ran parodies of this, among others the "Spot The Clue" strip. A whodunnit situation is shown, with the reader being asked to work out who the perpetrator is. Each time the villain is the one who made an innocuous error, ranging from incorrectly describing the era of a piece of furniture, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">to claiming to have been sending emails on a piece of hardware that everyone knows is too unreliable to work.</a>
</li><li> Lampshaded by "Inspector Bougret", an occasional feature of Gotlib's strip <em>Rubrique-à-Brac</em>. Presented with two suspects, one of whom is blatantly guilty, Bougret accuses him for an absurd reason. In one case, the murder weapon is a brick of a material unknown on Earth; Bougret accuses the one who willingly shakes his hand, because only an extraterrestrial would shake a cop's hand — not because he's visibly not human.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a></em> comic featured Jimmy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">crossdressing</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">test the detective skills of his fanclub</a>. They found him out in part because "Jackie" had tied a bowtie into a garter, to show "herself" as a member of the club, and according to them, "girls don't wear neckties and never have the practice to tie them <em>that</em> well." This is probably news to the millions of women who help their boyfriends, sons, or husbands with getting their ties on.
</li><li> An issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a></em> featured an exploration of this, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Bruce Wayne</a> gives the corpse of a supposed suicide victim an autopsy. He points out that the bullet wound is on the forehead, at which Dick Grayson points out that it's not unheard of in suicides. He then points out that the exit wound suggests the bullet came from straight-on, and Dick again points out that it's weird, but not impossible. Then he points out that the angle suggests the gun was being held in the victim's left hand when they were right-handed, and Dick points out that the victim was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> and reasonably able with his left hand. Bruce responds by pointing out that, yes, it's <em>possible</em> that the victim held the gun to his head at a bizarre angle with the wrong hand, but it's not <em>likely</em>, and Dick keeps focusing on the least likely possibility - which is what causes them to conclude that they're being influenced mentally. And just to nail the coffin, he gives a much less disputable bit of evidence; namely, the bullet hole is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyLittleHeadshots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyLittleHeadshots">too neat</a> for a gun-to-the-head shot.
</li><li> In "Ego Trip", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnByrne">John Byrne</a>'s story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> 3D</em>, a receipt is found that mentions delivery of "zzxjoanw" to the victim. The cops figure it must have been some garbled message to someone named "Joan". Batman, armed with encyclopedic knowledge, knows that a zzxjoanw is actually a Maori drum and deduces that the victim was a collector of obscure musical instruments. The problem is that in real life, "zzxjoanw" is actually a fictitious entry in a 1903 music encyclopedia that managed to make it into two other books of "interesting words" over the next 50+ years, and no such instrument actually exists (Maori doesn't even have the letters Z, X, and J).
</li><li> Happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a> story. Hewey, Dewey and Louie see a celebrity order carrots in a restaurant, and — since said celebrity hates carrots, as stated on every magazine — they deduce that he must be an impostor, and the original has been kidnapped. The story ends with them freeing the real celebrity, who invites them to dinner as a thank-you... and orders a dish of carrots. When Hewey, Dewey and Louie express their incredulity, he answers "Why, do you really believe everything magazines print out?"

<ul><li> In an old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SlylockFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SlylockFox">Slylock Fox</a> Mystery</em> puzzle, Slylock investigates some stolen roses. Another character has some roses in a vase that she claims were a gift from her boyfriend. He deduces that she is lying, and that she is actually the flower thief. The reason? Well, aside from the fact that she is one of the recurring "villain of the week" characters, the roses still have thorns on them, and a florist would have removed them before selling the roses. Never mind the fact that many florists don't remove thorns from flowers because doing so makes them wilt faster (as does excessive handling of cut flowers, so thorns shouldn't be too much of an issue). Nor the fact that her boyfriend could have picked them from his own garden and given them to her, or that <em>he</em> might have been the flower thief, and her story about receiving the flowers as a gift could still be true.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    Films ― Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpiderWoman">The Spider Woman</a></em> (1944), Sherlock Holmes deduces that a series of apparent suicides were really murders because "suicides invariably leave notes behind them," and none of these people did. Actually, no more than about 20% of suicides leave a note.
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Soultaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Soultaker">Soultaker</a></em>, a cop investigating a fatal car crash finds it odd that the doors of the car are both wide open. He doesn't buy that a closed, even locked car door could fly open if the car were to crash, and asks his partner, "What are the odds?" (It's because the ghosts of the passengers opened them.) In reality, the odds of both doors of a two-door car being flung open in a high speed head-on collision are <em>pretty goddamn good</em>. This didn't escape notice when the movie was featured on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RearWindow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RearWindow">Rear Window</a></em>, the main character Jeff and his girlfriend Lisa suspect that a man living in an apartment near Jeff's place has murdered his wife. They ask a police detective friend of Jeff's to investigate the case, but he comes to the conclusion that the woman has simply gone on a trip. Lisa then argues that if they can find the woman's wedding ring in the apartment, that would prove that she was murdered, as no woman would go on a trip and leave her wedding ring behind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lisa eventually sneaks into the apartment and finds the ring, which is enough to convince the detective that the woman may have been murdered.</span> In real life, there might be numerous reason why someone wouldn't wear their wedding ring, especially if they're going through marital strife, which was the case with this woman.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwoMinuteMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwoMinuteMysteries">Two-Minute Mysteries</a></em> by Donald Sobol.
<ul><li> The "mule" clue was used in "The Case of Molly's Mule". Sobol would later reuse this clue in an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Encyclopedia Brown</a></em> mystery called "The Case of the Gold Rush". The first time can be excused as a common mistake, but the second time less so.
</li><li> A <em>Two-Minute Mystery</em> had a deaf witness's testimony that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingLips">read the suspect's lips</a> and took special note of it because the suspect was whispering called into question, because supposedly, he shouldn't have been able to tell the suspect was whispering. However, whispering is just when instead of using your vocal cords normally, you create turbulence with them, producing a hissing sound. This then requires you to use your lips and mouth to create sounds that your vocal cords normally would, and is <em>very</em> noticeable to a lip reader. You can easily demonstrate this by saying the same word as a whisper and in normal voice, and feel how different your mouth moves. Then try freezing your jaw and lips in place and speaking, something you can do mostly understandably with operating your vocal cords normally, but you can't produce meaningful sounds at all if you try it while whispering.
</li><li> In one <em>Two-Minute Mysteries</em> story, a man relates how he leaned over his train bunk and read a headline on the newspaper the man below him was apparently reading. His companion deduced that the man with the newspaper was the perpetrator, because the <em>only</em> way the first man could have read the headline is if the newspaper was held upside-down (and therefore upside-up, relatively speaking, to the first man's eyes.) However, many people can read upside-down text <em>just fine</em>, especially if the text is in a large font and the message short (like a newspaper headline). Many dyslexics can read upside down almost as fast at reading the normal way, sometimes even faster. Even without any skill at it, everyone who can read can decipher upside-down print letter by letter. It may take a few minutes, but what's time to someone sitting bored in a train? Or, even easier, the top half of the paper may have been folded back while the man read the bottom.
</li><li> In "Murder at the Zoo", Haledjian meets with a zookeeper after a doorman working at the zoo is found killed. The zookeeper claims to have been alerted to the murder when he heard the scream of a giraffe, since one of them had been caught in the crossfire. Instantly Haledjian declares him to be the real murderer, because according to him, giraffes have no vocal cords. In reality, giraffes have vocal cords so large that they usually make sounds too low in pitch for humans to hear. This is why biologists for a long time thought that giraffes made no vocalizations. While adult giraffes usually seem silent from our perspective, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7iuOZVJhs0&amp;t=1m50s">calves can be quite noisy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> An alleged suicide note from a linguistics professor is determined to be a fake due to some grammatical "mistakes" that a true linguist would never make, including the use of a split infinitive. The correctness of split infinitives is a matter of great debate; while some do abhor them, many grammarians have no problem with them at all. And that's before you have to wonder if a person contemplating suicide is in the correct frame of mind to even consider proofreading their own <em>suicide note</em> (not to mention that despite the common misconception, linguistics is not the study of all the grammar rules your primary school English teacher taught you).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Encyclopedia Brown</a></em>, the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>, also by Sobol, often bases the solution of mysteries on assertions that a certain event could not have happened as described for a particular reason. In some cases, the reason would make the event unlikely, but not impossible. Other times, the reason is simply false.
<ul><li> The page quote comes from a mystery where one kid with a cast on his left arm is accused of stealing some keys, and in fact they're found in his pants pocket in his locker. However, the "proof" that he didn't do it is found in that the keys are in his left pocket, and, according to Encyclopedia, it's <em>impossible</em> to put keys in the opposite pocket of the hand they're in while running, as Bugs Meany claims happened. It might be more difficult for some than others, and there would be very little logical reason to do so, but it's certainly not impossible for <em>everyone</em>. Though in a technical subversion of this trope, the pants pocket scene isn't actually the final <em>conviction</em> per se.
</li><li> In one case, the culprit's alibi was that, when he walked past the victim's house, he heard the electric clock (which was unplugged when the crime was committed) ticking, the contradiction being that electric clocks don't tick. When this was first written, (back in the 1970s), this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">Conviction by Contradiction</a>, though questions like "How loud would it have to be ticking to be audible outside the house?" and "Exactly how is this an alibi anyway?" might arise. Today, we can skip straight to the fact that some electric clocks — particularly analog clocks in which the second hand jumps from one mark to another and an early kind of digital clock where numbers were written on flaps that showed in succession (as shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GroundhogDay">Groundhog Day</a></em> among others) — <em>do</em> make sounds that, while distinct from pendulum-regulated clocks, are described as <em>"ticking"</em>. Additionally, some digital clocks that indicate seconds will play an artificial ticking sound.
</li><li> One involving a sword from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>. The guy hawking it claimed it was authentic due to the engraving showing that it was given to Stonewall Jackson by Robert E. Lee after the First Battle of Bull Run. The 'correct' answer was that the sword was fake, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronisticClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronisticClue">nobody would have called it FIRST Bull Run</a> until there had been a Second Bull Run (and the sword was dated August 21, 1861, just a month after the first battle). However, given how long it can take to commission, make, retrieve, and engrave a sword, it's entirely possible that the second battle a year later either already happened or was soon coming, necessitating the need for specificity. In fact, there are two other problems with the story, both of which would have been better pieces of evidence. One, Confederate forces did not refer to either battle as Bull Run at all, but rather as the Battles of Manassas,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0y7uz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0y7uz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0y7uz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The one being Union-specific nomenclature referring to a creek that passes through the battlefield, the other being Confederate nomenclature referring to the nearby city of Manassas, VA. Incidentally, the solution to the mystery does point this bit out too.</span> and two, General Lee wasn't <em>present</em> for the First Battle of Bull Run/Manassas: the Confederates there were led by P.G.T. Beauregard. Sobol pointed this latter fact out in later editions.
</li><li> Encyclopedia Brown pinned a crime on a magician because he was wearing short sleeves. He claimed that all magicians wore long sleeves so that they could pull objects out of them... except good magicians don't need anything of the sort. Many, in fact, wear short sleeves solely to impress people with the undeniable fact they have nothing up them, and at least one group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">performs magic in the nude</a>. There are entire styles of magic that depend on (for example) marked cards, psychological tricks, or props with trap doors, for which sleeves are completely useless. Even in cartoons, stage magicians as a whole tend to have the catchphrase "nothing up my sleeves", as they roll them up before a trick.
</li><li> One case was "solved" (by Sally, not Encyclopedia) because a couple sat in a restaurant with the man's back to the wall rather than the woman's, from which Sally deduced that each was actually a member of the other gender in disguise. This is because of a rule of etiquette that the woman should sit against the wall, so she can see and be seen. For this to be evidence, it would have to be the case that people followed this "rule" with no, or at best, very few exceptions; only Sally had ever heard of it. This same solution supposes that the victim is a woman so strong only a man could've knocked her out with one punch, ignoring the fact that the victim is, well, a very strong woman, which by itself admits that very strong women exist.
<ul><li> From a meta perspective this "solution" also ignores what a big piece of the books' internal logic "girls can be even tougher than boys" really is. The canonical reason the bullies Encyclopedia outsmarts don't try to get even by just punching his teeth out is his partnership with Sally, who beats up anyone who tries. The books go so far as to actually call her his bodyguard whenever they explain this.
</li></ul></li><li> Another solution was based entirely on the supposed 'fact' that roosters <em>only crow when they saw light</em>, apparently based on the urban legend that roosters crow at sunrise. The crime was a con man trying to convince kids he found a way to make roosters crow on command, but actually uncovering the cage so they saw light and thought it was sunrise; he claimed that he would soon improve the device to make hens cluck on command, and that whenever hens clucked, they laid an egg. Anybody who has been around a rooster for an extended period of time will know full well that they crow whenever the heck they want, whether the sun is out or not. And, of course, the hen part of his story should have been clearly false, especially since he was targeting the con towards chicken farmers.
</li><li> One solution in "Encyclopedia Brown Sets the Pace" relied on the fact that the culprit had used glycerin tears that fell from the outside corners of her eyes instead of the inside, thus revealing them to be fake, as "If only one tear falls, it will run from the inside corner of the eye, by the nose, and not from the outside corner." Only, none of that is true; how tears flow from a person's eyes is a function of the physical shape of their eyelids, nose and cheek, not to mention the orientation of the head relative to gravity's pull.
</li><li> In Encyclopedia Brown and similar riddles there are puzzles about coins being a forgery because the name of the ruler is King Bob the First or similar. Obviously, no monarch referred to himself as The First, right? Except that they dideither to show that they're first among equals, or because they had a son named after them, or because they would indeed be the first monarch with that name, as was, for instance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">The Pope</a> John Paul the First. Or recently abdicated Juan Carlos I (John Charles the First) of Spain.
</li><li> In the first case, Encyclopedia Brown deduces that the blind witness is lying because he has a newspaper in his room. Ignoring all the reasons one might have a newspaper one can't read in one's room<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1e2ls');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1e2ls" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1e2ls');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Perhaps the hotel leaves the local newspaper in every room</span>, it isn't even necessarily true that blind people can't read newspapers. Most legally "blind" people still have some amount of vision, and depending on the exact nature of the vision loss, it's entirely possible to be able to read a newspaper (perhaps with magnification).
</li><li> In one case involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a>, the solution to the crime lay in the fact that the murderer didn't leave prints, and "it was too hot for gloves," so they arrested the guy in gloves. Plenty of people wear gloves for all kind of reasons and in all kinds of weather.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>:
<ul><li> In "The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle", Sherlock Holmes deduces that the owner of a lost hat must be an intellectual, because it is a big hat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBrainIsBig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBrainIsBig">and so he has a large head</a>. This was partly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a> — <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">that was actually a serious scientific theory at the time<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — but even in the context of the era, it ignores the possibility that the hat's owner might simply have a very thick head of <em>hair</em> atop an average-size head, or a simple preference for oversized hats.
</li><li> In "The Adventure of the Priory School", Holmes deduces the direction a bicycle was heading by the fact that the hind tire track passes over the front tire track. However, the hind tire would pass over the front tire tracks regardless of the direction (unless the bicycle was in the process of turning at the time). <a class="urllink" href="https://mindyourdecisions.com/blog/2010/02/02/a-mystery-sherlock-holmes-couldnt-solve-but-you-can/">This article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> explains an actual way of figuring out the bicycle's direction.
<ul><li> Conan Doyle himself checked that theory after getting some mail from the readers, and admitted that this is, indeed, his mistake; he also said that Holmes could've used a different clue: on an uneven ground the bike leaves a deeper track when going upwards than downwards, and that is enough in the context of the story.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In a <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MikeMistMinuteMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MikeMistMinuteMystery">Mike Mist Minute Mystery</a></em> by Max Allan Collins in the early 1980s, the title character supposedly identifies a crook because she claimed that she cashed a check using an automatic teller machine, which Mike claims is impossible. Here, the readers wrote in to note that it's done <em>all the time</em>; you enter the correct amount of the value of the check into the machine as a deposit and you are free to withdraw from that amount. And of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a>: you can now deposit a check into (some) ATMs, and the machine is sophisticated enough to scan it and correctly parse the writing as a check amount.
</li><li> One entry in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArmchairDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArmchairDetective">The Armchair Detective</a></em> series stated that one true way of knowing if a pre-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> telegram is false is if the phrase "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>" or "The First World War" is ever mentioned, on the assumption that nobody could have foreseen a second World War before it started. However, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_One#Names">it was used by some almost immediately after hostilities began.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Note that the series in general isn't particularly prone to this. In his defense, those were not <em>common</em> terms, and would hardly be included in a telegram where they could easily say "The War" or "The Great War" with fewer letters. It may not be rock-solid evidence, but it's a good reason to be very skeptical.
<ul><li> It should be noted that using them as the actual <em>name</em> of the War would be even more suspiciousalthough the First World War was, indeed, used, it at first was more of a descriptive term (IE, describing the War as the first World War in contrast to previous, non-global, wars, and, as in the case of the first recorded use of the term, the early-war term 'The European War').

</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TieInNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TieInNovel">Tie-In Novel</a> <em>Mr. Monk in Outer Space</em>, one of Monk's deductions that makes him conclude that a person was killed in a different hotel room and moved downstairs to a different room in a maid's cart hinges on the fact that insulin must be refrigerated. Except it doesn't; diabetics commonly keep vials of insulin currently in use at room temperature, usually due to the discomfort of injecting cold insulin. Refrigerating insulin mostly has to do with preserving it longer: Doctors recommend keeping insulin at room temperature for a month at most, while keeping it cold extends this to six months. He also incorrectly states that all diabetics take insulin, when some Type 2 diabetics can control their diabetes through diet and exercise alone, and most can control it with the help of oral medication.
<ul><li> One of the subcases in <em>Mr. Monk and the Dirty Cop</em> that is mentioned in a few paragraphs takes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown">Encyclopedia Brown</a> example used as the page quote. What is known about said case is that it is a man who tripped over a crack in a parking lot and broke his arm, which is locked at a 90 degree angle according to his doctors, yet it is possible to see his car keys in his right pocket, which should be inaccessible to that hand. For all we know, this person could just easily grab their car keys with their left handbut it is at least <em>good reason</em> to look closer and see if the man's arm were truly injured.
</li><li> The above also ties in with Monk's general tendency to avert this trope as Monk will often quickly find a series of points that leads him to believe that a suspect is the culprit but more often then not most or all of them could be explained away very easily. Monk will agree that all of the counter points are valid but use their improbability as the basis to do further investigation for actual proof ("He's the guy. I don't know how, but he's the guy.").
</li></ul></li><li> One Encyclopedia Brown-esque story concluded that the suspect was obviously lying because he claimed he was at a laundromat putting clothes into a top-loading dryer. The detective claimed that <em>all</em> dryers are front-loading. This is incorrect; top-loading models existed on the market even in the time period when the story was written.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2e813');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2e813" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2e813');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although since they're pretty uncommon, it becomes a matter of going to the laundromat and checking if the place really does use top-loading dryers.</span>
<ul><li> This happened with Encyclopedia Brown himself. Bugs Meany lied by copying another kid's true version of events, changing washer to dryer but otherwise using the exact same words. The first kid said he'd put the clothes in from the top, and Bugs copied that detail.

Cyric, observing that none of the witnesses has aged as a result, concludes that the figure isn't a genuine ghost (which had an aging aura under then-current D&amp;D rules), but a harmless product of wild magic. Not only is there no clear reason for him to assume a product of wild magic would necessarily be harmless, but there are <em>several dozen</em> other ghost-like creatures in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> Verse that it could have been, that would not age witnesses yet would be extremely dangerous in other ways.

The mother's eyes go wide with realization and she promptly marches the girl home. Later Harry learns that her father had been hitting her, and Harry's comment brought it to the mothers attention. Of course the girl could have easily fallen off a bike without scraping her hands. While the mother may have known or suspected what was going on, there was no real reason for Harry to think it was a particularly suspicious claim.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryHigginsClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryHigginsClark">Mary Higgins Clark</a> novel <em>While My Pretty One Sleeps</em>, the as-yet unidentified killer notes that he made a major error in dressing his victim's body and realizes that the protagonist will realize it, given her knowledge of fashion (she's a designer and designed the outfit that the woman is dressed in, but he got the shoes wrong, a mistake that the victim, herself a designer, wouldn't have made.)

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder5');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder5" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Columbo">Columbo</a></em> titled "An Exercise in Fatality" has a key piece of evidence that a fake suicide was really a murder hinge on how the victim's shoes were tied. This actually could have been reasonable evidence, except that the way the evidence is framed and explained is completely self-contradictory and counter-factual. The problems with Columbo's explanation are as follows:
<ul><li> Firstly, Columbo explains that when right-handed people tie their own shoes, the big/top loop ends up over the big toe every single time — which suggests that people tie their shoes with a different dominant hand depending on whether they're tying their right or left shoe, as opposed to using the exact same process on each foot. This is completely wrong, as any non-ambidextrous person who ties their shoes would know.
</li><li> Secondly, Columbo explains that the victim's shoes were tied with the big/top loop over the little toe, indicating that a right-handed person must have done up his shoes for him, because they would be doing their usual action backwards. The problem with this? The victim was clearly stated and shown to be left-handed, thus this supposed evidence doesn't contradict the notion that the victim tied his own shoelaces, because nothing would be "backwards" about the way his shoes were tied.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Machismo", the BAU travels to Mexico to assist the local police force in arresting a serial killer that is targeting elderly women. They find that the killer is also a previously unreported serial rapist, and that he is killing the mothers of the women he raped, because each of the elderly women's second surname is the same as the younger women's first surname. In Spanish naming customs, every person has their father's first surname as their first, and their mother's first surname as their secondthe opposite to what happens in the episode.
</li><li> Reid insists that a person who kidnapped a child and then makes threatening phone calls to his parents utilizing a voice changer is in fact a woman, because the caller didn't taunt the FBI, therefore the kidnapper isn't competitive and ego-driven, and because they insisted on describing certain aspects of the child's clothing, such as his shoes being teal, the idea (which Reid actually spells out) being women wouldn't be competitive and ego-driven, and only women notice or call attention to small details like colors. He turns out to be completely right on all points as regards the perpetrator, which, of course, ignores the alternate possible explanation that people are individuals and plenty of men are not competitive by nature and notice small things like shoe colors. The kidnapper having been a shoe salesman might've been an interesting reveal.
</li><li> An in-universe one: In "A Higher Power", the BAU is called to investigate a recent spike in suicides in a small community in Pittsburgh, the victims of which had lost their children to a huge fire months prior and had apparently succumbed to their grief. They are called in because the lead officer's brother was one of the victims and the cop is adamant that his brother would never have killed himself so suddenly and suspects foul play. The team investigates and discovers that the suicides are actually staged murders, caused by an "Angel of Death" type who had been attending the victims' group therapy sessions looking to "save their souls from their grief". After the catching the killer, the cop thanks the BAU for their help and for vindicating his suspicions. However, the team reveals that they had looked into his brother's suicide as well and it turns out that he had never been to the same support groups as the killer and his suicide did not match the killer's MO, meaning his death was very likely an actual suicide, something the cop is heartbroken to hear.
</li></ul></li><li> Would you believe <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> is accused of this?
<ul><li> In perhaps the most memorable chain of cases ever, the identity of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miniature Killer</span> is revealed by bleach, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the only linking thing in the four mini-crime scenes</span>. However, one of them was listed not under the name "bleach", but by its chemical name, NaCl. NaCl is sodium chloride (table salt) while bleach is sodium hypochlorite (NaClO).
</li><li> Lampshaded in another episode. Captain Brass decides to reopen an "accidental death" case after he sees the supposedly bereaved husband coming out of a club to hop into a brand new sports car. He later tells the husband that his (Brass') suspicions should've been aroused earlierwhen he interviewed the husband, the man said that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificTense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificTense">"loveD"</a> his wife, and Brass' experience was that innocent people never referred to their loved ones in the past tense so soon after their death. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3scvg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3scvg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3scvg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although he also notes that this is not always true, even in his experience, but it's been true often enough that he should've realized something was wrong at the time (presumably, some cases of past tense involve couples who fell out of love or were having marital problems).</span> While this obviously (as the accused's lawyer specifically points out) means little legally, it did give Brass more reason to pursue his new suspicions.
</li><li> And there's an episode where Catherine suspects a mother assisted in a murder her son took part in because a body bag found at the crime scene was neatly folded, and Catherine said, "Teenagers never fold things, <em>mothers</em> do!" Apparently clean freak teenagers (or sloppy mothers) do not exist in Catherine's mind.
</li><li> In another episode Catherine (again) catches a woman who killed her daughter by which way the woman was looking when she was talking to Catherine. Catherine deduces that the woman was looking left and therefore lying. To be fair, she only brought it up after using a forensic demonstration to learn that no-one <em>but</em> her could've drowned her daughter, but it seems very weird that she'd use eye direction as evidence after that.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E12ThePandoricaOpens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E12ThePandoricaOpens">"The Pandorica Opens"</a> has an in-universe example: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Alliance</a> believes the Doctor to be responsible for the impending reality-ending catastrophe caused by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the TARDIS exploding</span> because "only the Doctor can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pilot the TARDIS</span>". Not only does the audience know this is not the cause, the episode makes sure to remind people that this logic is faulty by showing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">River Song flying the TARDIS after the Doctor sends her to go get it</span>.
</li><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForensicFiles">Forensic Files</a></em>, "Yes, in Deed", the prime suspect saving a movie ticket stub to establish an alibi was one of the reasons the police, and one of the prosecutors, believed that he was the culprit of a murder and arson. One of the detectives interviewed remarked that nobody ever keeps their movie stubs, eliminating all who might do so for any number of reasons. It was mentioned that the suspect wasn't in the habit of keeping receipts, though.
</li><li> An interesting in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>. House suspects an amputee is lying about being a Vietnam veteran. When he discovers that the guy is from Canada, he confronts him and triumphantly points out that Canada didn't send troops to Vietnam. The guy angrily points out that Canada did send troops to enforce the Paris Peace Accords, resulting in him losing his hand to a grenade. This also fails to account for all the Canadians who enlisted in the US Military and volunteered to go to Vietnam (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_Vietnam_War#Canadians_in_the_U.S._military">around 30,000 in all<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), much like how many Americans volunteered to fight for Canada and other Allied countries before the USA entered WWI and WWII.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em>, "The Curious Tale of Mr Spearfish" is resolved when Jonathan notes that two blue-eyed parents can't likely have a brown-eyed child and thus a character in the story is adopted and is secretly of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">Royal Blood</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://genetics.thetech.org/how-blue-eyed-parents-can-have-brown-eyed-children">This is false.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JudgeJudy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JudgeJudy">Judge Judy</a></em>, a man is trying to collect money owed to him by a woman who rented a room from him. He says he provided her with an invoice each month and brought <strong>copies</strong> showing how much the woman owed him. The invoices had the invoice date on each of them, but they also had a date in the header or footer showing the date they were printed. Judge Judy points out that these invoices are fake because they all have the same date. The guy made the argument that the invoices were created when he said they were, pointing to the invoice dates, but the other date was the current date, the date he printed them. Judy said something like, "I'm not stupid, you know," and ruled in favor of the woman who owed him the money, because apparently to her it's impossible that anyone printing a copy of something would record the date the copy was printed. Never mind the fact that Microsoft Word has a feature where a date within the document can automatically update itself each time the file is accessed.
</li><li> Frequently done on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> as well. In one episode, the detectives have found the remains of a woman believed to have died in the 9/11 attacks (her hand was found at the scene, along with her purse). The prosecutors are trying the man she was having an affair with. Serena, a woman, notes two things—that the purse in question was an evening bag, not something that a woman would be carrying for a day of work, and that her <em>boyfriend</em> had claimed that it was her work bag. The inconsistency reveals that <em>he</em> is the woman's killer. Because, apparently, no boyfriend in history has ever misidentified which purse his girlfriend uses for which occasion or failed to notice any difference at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em>:
<ul><li> A murder suspect's alibi is that she and her girlfriend spent the day shopping and having lunch. They claim to have paid for everything with cash (to explain the lack of credit card records) and to have thrown out the receipts for their purchases. DS Ronnie Brooks scoffs at this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ronnie Brooks:</strong> I've been married twice. <em>NO</em> woman throws out the receipts for clothes she just bought!
</div></li><li> CP Alesha Phillips gets leery of a defendant's claim that she acted in self-defense — killing the victim after he raped her — when the girl is completely blase about having to testify, citing that most rape victims are usually terrified at the prospect, as she was. Depending on which study you read, anywhere from 12 to 60 percent of women who are sexually assaulted have their emotions "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSafeMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSafeMode">lock down</a>" during the attack, as a form of reflexive mental/emotional self-protection, and frequently maintain that low-emotion reaction later. Overall, it never occurs to Alesha that the girl is in shock rather than lying (though she actually WAS lying).
</li><li> In another episode, a murder suspect claims to have left his job at "5 o'clock. On the button." When the detectives question his boss, DS Matt Devlin gets suspicious when the man uses the exact same phrase. While he's correct in suspecting that the two are lying and rehearsed their stories, the thought that either man could have simply picked up the phrase from the other after years of working together never occurs to him.
</li></ul></li><li> This is often invoked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheListener" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheListener">The Listener</a></em> when Toby has to make up some story of how he figured out a person was lying to him since he cannot reveal that he figured it out through telepathy. Knowing it would never be accepted as evidence in a court of law, Toby and the cops must then find other evidence in order to make an arrest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em>:
<ul><li> A man dressed as a Roman Catholic priest is giving Jessica what might be important information. Jessica quotes Henry David Thoreau, but attributes the quote to St. Thomas Aquinas. The "priest" doesn't call her on it — and supposedly any real priest would know. Apparently imagining that all Catholic priests immediately recognize everything St. Thomas Aquinas did <em>not</em> say and always call people out on it, Jessica "knows" he's not really a priest.
</li><li> In another episode, Jessica and the local sheriff find a matchbook inside a woman's car after the car was pulled out of water with the woman deceased. The two argue as if the only and mutually exclusive possibilities are that the woman stopped there the night she died, and that the matchbook was planted or placed there. This is treated as an important clue, as if there are no other ways a person might have some detritus like a matchbook in their car.
</li><li> In a first-season episode, Jessica solves a murder by realizing that the police Lieutenant who was investigating the murder dismissed a spot where a framed item had been removed as having been nothing more than a family picture could only have known that if he had been inside the home prior to being summoned, as the victim's daughter had removed the picture as soon as she found her father dead. Except that he could have potentially learned that from the various people who were in the house when the body was discovered. This is a bit downplayed, though, as the Lieutenant does not think to offer this excuse and instead pulls a gun — the murder weapon — on Jessica, who (after he is disarmed) acknowledges is the only real piece of evidence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode has Cate determining a suspect is lying by the same logic. He looks to his left, so he's obviously recalling a concocted story. Had he been telling the truth, he would have looked to the right.
</li><li> In another episode, they get a tip that a man's wife and daughter might have been kidnapped, so they go to the house to investigate and find the daughter's sweater lying on the walkway. Cate declares that it's proof that "Either she left in a hurry or she was forced to" over McGee's objections, because "little girls aren't typically slobs." Where to begin?
<ul><li> First of all, small children of any gender aren't particularly known for caring too much about messes (granted, the girl was closer to seven than two, so she was <em>old enough</em> to take responsibility, but that doesn't mean she <em>likes to</em>).
</li><li> Second, by Cate's own logic, little girls "aren't typically" slobs. So she's even acknowledging that there are little girls who <em>are</em> slobs, and since she knows almost nothing about this child, it's entirely possible she's one of the supposedly rare messy ones.
</li><li> Also, one of the few facts she <em>does</em> know about the girl is that she's blind. Now, blind doesn't mean stupid, so yes, she'd notice if a sweater she was currently wearing or one she was holding fell, and it was in the middle of the walkway, so she'd probably trip over it if she walked past, so she'd find out it was there eventually, but a blind person isn't necessarily going to notice something being out of place. Maybe her mother was carrying a pile of clothes to the dry cleaner and dropped it while walking behind the girl. Are little girls supposed to have a sixth sense regarding things being messy? Is <em>that</em> why they're not typically slobs?
</li><li> She also presents an alternative theory right there in her comment: "Either she <strong>left in a hurry</strong>..." The kid plays piano. Maybe the mother forgot a lesson or recital until the last minute and was rushing to get there in time and didn't feel the need to stop and pick up a sweater off the ground.
</li><li> Now, the fact remains that the sweater was the <em>only</em> thing lying out in the yard, and since the girl was blind, it would be unusual for her or her parents to leave things out where she could trip over them, and there was evidence inside the house to confirm that the mother and daughter were taken against their will, but Cate doesn't consider any of those facts. "Girl + Mess = Foul Play" is the entirety of her logic.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sherlock">Sherlock</a></em> is often guilty of this.
<ul><li> "A Study in Pink" has Sherlock deduce that the former owner of John's mobile was his brother and a drunk runs entirely on these. He assumes that people not wanting to pay the entire rent of a flat would be frugal in every other aspect of their lives despite flat mates being quite common among people of varying financial backgrounds. He assumes that older people don't have cell phones, which was sort of true in the time period the show was produced but the phone being a gift explains that. The scratches on the power connection are a shout out to the same deduction being used in the original stories but for watch winding. However as most cell phone owners can attest, the tiny plug of that style of cell phone is difficult to find and people often plug their phones in in the dark, most cell phones over six months old will have scratches around the outlet, whatever the owner's intoxication level. In fairness, he did admit the last one was a "shot in the dark," and later explicitly stated he wasn't expecting to get <em>everything</em> right.
</li><li> "The Blind Banker" has Sherlock deduce that a suicide was actually a murder because the person was left-handed and was shot in the right side of the head and it would be awkward to twist the left arm around to right side of the head. This runs on the assumption that left-hand dominant people are completely incapable of using their right hands. Putting a gun to your head is a simple motion easily completed with the non-dominant hand. There's also the fact that most guns are designed for right-handed people, and as a result it's not uncommon for left-handed people to shoot right-handed — Watson himself is shown writing with his left hand and shooting with his right. On top of that, powder burns and blood splattering could have easily revealed the distance and angle of the shot to rule out suicide, which makes the police unquestioningly buying Sherlock's deduction unrealistic.
</li><li> Another episode has him deduce that a man must be cheating on his wife because his phone had a waterproof case, reasoning that because he didn't have the tan of a man who works outdoors, that must mean he takes his phone into the pool with him, which must be because there's something on it he wants to hide from his wife, which must be text messages from a secret lover. Because apparently there's no other possible reason to take your phone into a pool.
</li></ul></li><li> A rather amusing in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>. When O'Brien is marked for death by some crazy aliens because he's one of the last people alive who knows how a forbidden superweapon works, they send a bogus video back to the Federation that shows him dying in an accident. His wife realizes something's fishy because he's drinking coffee in the video and she knows he never drinks coffee in the afternoon, when the video was supposedly taken. But then after the plot is foiled and Miles comes back home, as he's settling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">he asks for a cup of coffee</a>. She reacts with astonishment, and he says he drinks coffee in the afternoon all the time!
<ul><li> Another amusing in-universe example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>. At the beginning of the episode "Ship in a Bottle", Data, playing Sherlock Holmes on the holodeck, says that the suspect has to be guilty because the attacker was left handed. Data throws an object at the suspect, which the suspect catches, proving that the suspect is left handed. Except, as Geordi points out, the object is in the suspect's RIGHT hand. Data notes that there must be a glitch in the holodeck switching the dominant hand of the holodeck characters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGlitchInTheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGlitchInTheMatrix">This actually becomes a critical clue later in the episode.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UnsolvedMysteries">Unsolved Mysteries</a></em>: A segment featured a missing woman whose husband claimed that she had walked out on him, citing that several of her things and her suitcase were missing. When her suitcase was found, it contained <em>exactly</em> what he said it would, peaking the cops' suspicions, as they found it highly unlikely that any man could know exactly what was in his wife's suitcase, as he himself had no idea what was in his own wife's purse. (It's actually a very sad aversion, as to this day, the woman remains missing, and despite the cops' strong suspicions that he killed her, they have zero evidence to support this, meaning he remains a free man.)
