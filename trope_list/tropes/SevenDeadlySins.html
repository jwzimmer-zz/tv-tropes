Originally they were termed the seven deadly <em>vices</em> (which are the opposite of "virtues" Ah-ha, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>!).
</p><p>In alphabetical order, here are the big seven, along with a few examples of tropes embodying each (keep in mind that there are plenty of tropes that reference them, but including them all would make this entry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/AllBlueEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/AllBlueEntry">nigh-unreadable</a>):

Hey, sometimes others get the cool stuff first. Doesn't stop you from wanting it. Those that act on this tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealThisIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealThisIndex">thieves of any stripe</a> (also driven by Greed). Other villains who qualify include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">The Resenter</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">Crazy Jealous Guy</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairestOfThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairestOfThemAll">Fairest of Them All</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaTestBaddie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaTestBaddie">Beta Test Baddie</a> (also driven by Pride), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Green-Eyed Monster</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> (also driven by Lust and occasionally Greed) and anyone who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">murders the hypotenuse</a> or suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallPoppySyndrome">Tall Poppy Syndrome</a>. Whereas Envy is a desire for what someone else possesses, Jealousy is the fear of losing what you possess. As such, they are easily and often confused for each other. Given the context, either can accurately refer to almost anything — a bauble, money, significant other, or baseball card collection. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">Taking pleasure at the pain or misfortune of another person</a> is called Schadenfreude and is a demonstration of Envy. Envy is usually associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakesareSinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakesareSinister">snakes</a>, dogs or goats and the color <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenandMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenandMean">green</a>. The punishment in Hell for committing this sin is to be put in ice-cold water.

In pop culture, this sin is almost always associated with overeating, which is a start, but theologically it applies to overconsumption of anything. Taking more than your share is a key part, as is wasting the excess. It has also been equated with any kind of addiction in modern times. This is one of the sins more likely to appear in heroic characters — after all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eaters</a> are funny, and their obvious extension <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnivore">Extreme Omnivore</a> is even funnier. Also, this might explain why so many tropes have food in their names while having nothing to do with food. The most villainous practitioners of this sin are typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">cannibals</a>. Gluttony is usually associated with pigs and the color orange. The punishment in Hell for committing this sin is to eat rats, snakes and toads. The patron demon of Gluttony is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a>, or possibly Behemoth. <strong>Opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicVow">Temperance</a></strong>.

Often simply referred to as greed, but avarice includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspicuousConsumption">spending money pointlessly</a> as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge">hoarding it</a>. An oft-misquoted passage in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> says that "the love of money is the root of many kinds of evil." In 3rd century AD, Christians used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">the acronym ROMA as a veiled insult against the Empire</a>. What was ROMA? Radix Omnium Malorum Avaritia, or: the Root of All Evil is Greed. This one is popular amongst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitches</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executives</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConArtist">Con Artists</a> (also driven by Sloth), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">Diabolical Mastermind</a> and anyone who would say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">Screw the Rules, I Have Money!</a>. Greed is also very commonly associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">ambition</a>. Usually has a character with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingdingEyes">dollar signs in their eyes</a>. When treated as a vital part of the economy rather than a sin, it's called "the profit motive". Greed is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">associated with</a> foxes or frogs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">and the color</a> gold. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">punishment in Hell for this</a> is to be boiled alive in oil. The patron demon of Avarice is Mammon (as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">the Mammon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis">Machine</a>). <strong>Opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFriendInNeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFriendInNeed">Charity</a></strong>.

It's the desire to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexTropes">know someone Biblically</a>, but traditionally included all other sins of physical desire or luxury (such as drug addiction), not just sex. How evil this is depends often on the author's view of sex. Authors with a much more positive view of the matter will show this trope via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Lovable Sex Maniacs</a> and occasional bouts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusSexMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusSexMachina">Deus Sex Machina</a>, and maybe a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonus</a> if the work is theoretically for kids.

The reason this entry didn't come into existence earlier despite the fact that everyone liked the idea, sloth is the lack of desire to actually do some work.

Sloth is often ranked high in the deadly sins because of this sinister and far more actively destructive side of its nature — it destroys Time itself.

Many of them have powers appropriate to their name: Envy is a shape shifter with a raging inferiority complex who can imitate anyone and ruins people's lives because it can't have one itself, Gluttony is a simpleton who can consume anything, Greed has a shield to protect his possessions, and Lust is beautiful but deadly. This is made more obvious in the manga where Sloth is a giant that frequently falls asleep and yet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is both the fastest and strongest of the Homunculi; he wastes all the potential he has through laziness</span>. Pride looks like Father's original form, and suffers from a near total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a> due to his inability to see beyond himself, and Wrath <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leads Amestris through constant wars and genocides to cause enough bloodshed for Father's plans</span>, and is an absolutely <em>brutal</em> fighter. The reason they are named after the Seven Sins is because they are the <em>embodiment</em> of the desires of their "Father." Lampshaded by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hohenheim</span>, who notes that Father was much more human back when he had all his seven desires in him.

</li><li> Greed is a particular example of why this didn't work. Father couldn't purge himself entirely of greed, because greed includes the desire for power. Without that, Father wouldn't have any motivation, so he only purged the parts he didn't want: Desire for companionship and friendship. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Because the Homunculus Greed desires this, he ends up betraying Father and joining the heroes.</span>

The seven protagonists set to battle against them in a fight for the right to inherit a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">mafia</a> family embody the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenHeavenlyVirtues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenHeavenlyVirtues">Seven Heavenly Virtues</a> (but not as obviously as the antagonists). The Varia take their names directly from the Seven Deadly Sins:
<ul><li> Greed: Mammon (obsessed with money)
</li><li> Envy: Leviathan (wishes to be the only one to please his boss; is envious of Tsuna and his group from taking his "rightful" position as Thunder Guardian)
</li><li> Gluttony/Gula: Gola Mosca (consumes the Dying Will Flames of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vongola IX</span> for power; bonus points for "mosca" meaning "fly", as Beelzebub is also known as "Lord of the Flies")

</li><li> Sloth/Acedia: Belphegor (a natural-born killer who is lazy and doesn't take his job very seriously)
</li><li> Wrath: Xanxus + Flame of Wrath (a generally unpleasant person who calls those he considers beneath him scum. He possesses the Flames of Wrath, originally owned by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vongola II</span>, the most powerful Dying Will Flames in existence).

<ul><li> Pride: Belial (An androgynous, genderless demon who claims to love Lucifer more than anyone.)
</li><li> Wrath: Barbelo (Lucifer's first wife who enjoys wreaking havoc with her pet dragons.)
</li><li> Envy: Leviathan (A sea serpent-like demon.)

<ul><li> 341 — The Envy: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> team Lolly and Menoly.</span>
</li><li> 342 — The Greed: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ichigo shuts down Orihime from getting involved in <em>his</em> fight.</span>
</li><li> 343 — The Gluttony: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Starts with Yammy stuffing his face, then has him kill Lolly and Menolly for the lulz.</span>
</li><li> 344 — The Pride: The Pride was twofold, both Yammy's fall (Pride goeth before) and the Pride Ichigo expressed. That more foreshadowing in that instance, as he felt he stood a chance against Ulquiorra.
</li><li> 345 — The Sloth: Rudobon creates clones that fight for him while he watches safely from afar.
</li><li> 346 — The Wrath: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ulquiorra's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a> as he thrashes Ichigo.</span>

</li><li> Also some Espada are related to the Seven Sins somehow:
<ul><li> Baraggan: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>. His Zanpakuto is called Arrogante and he considers himself a god.
</li><li> Yammy: Wrath. His Zanpakuto is Ira, he's extremely violent and easily angered.
</li><li> Aaroniero: Gluttony / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a>. His Zanpakuto is Glotoneria, and his aspect of death is Greed. He eats people to gain their powers and constantly wants more.
</li><li> Coyote Starrk: Sloth. While he's very powerful, he prefers to sleep and loaf around, and it takes a lot to motivate him to fight seriously.
</li><li> Szayel: Lust. His Zanpakuto is Fornicaras ("You will fornicate" in Spanish), he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> and a lot of his actions invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">Does This Remind You of Anything?</a>, including swallowing his sword and seeming to suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmodestOrgasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmodestOrgasm">The Immodest Orgasm</a> during his transformation.
</li><li> Nnoitra: Envy. He wants to be the strongest warrior and cannot stand anybody who can overpower him.
</li><li> Ulquiorra: Despair. Fits the sometimes-counted 8th sin by his nature as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a> and attempts to act as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeCrusher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeCrusher">Hope Crusher</a> toward the protagonists.
</li><li> It should also be noted that, on top of the sins they embody primarily, Starrk and Nnoitra both also embody Despair to some extent. Starrk fell into Despair after being forced to wander alone for unknown amounts of time due to his immense power causing him to have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">"Instant Death" Radius</a> effect on weaker Hollows, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">his only reason for joining Aizen was because the forces he gathered were actually strong enough to survive being around him</a>. Nnoitra's Envy stems from Despair, having already crossed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> and come to the belief that power is the only thing worth living for, he envies anyone more powerful than him, and his only real stated goal is to either become the most powerful by killing everyone stronger than him, or die trying.

For example, the one representing Lust can <em>completely shut down</em> any other Douji within a several mile radius. The one representing greed can multiply endlessly. The one representing Sloth didn't do a lot during his first appearance, but when he moved, he killed six people in <em>one strike</em>. Etc.

<ul><li> Pride: Muzan Kibutsuji himself, whose ultimate goal is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">become a perfect being, with all the perks of an unkillable demon, without their trademark weakness to sunlight</span>. The King of Demons is also proud, short-tempered, spiteful, vicious and ruthless in general, most of which stems from his sociopathic disregard for other, "lesser" beings.
</li><li> Envy: Upper Kizuki 1, Kokushibo - his entire reason for joining Muzan stemmed from his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">brother, Yoriichi Tsugikuni, upstaging him in everything he set his mind to, especially in swordsmanship and fighting in general</span>. After years of fighting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his brother's shadow</span>, Kokushibo became desperate enough to conclude that the only way out for him was to accept demonic power in order to surpass his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">twin</span>.
</li><li> Gluttony: Upper Kizuki 2, Doma, achieved his power by continuosly devouring the followers of a cult founded around his worship. He also loves eating young women and can literally absorb his victims through his skin, leaving nothing of them behind.
</li><li> Wrath: Upper Kizuki 3, Akaza, became a demon after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">violently avenging the deaths of his loved ones</span>, after which he lost his will to live . Due to becoming a demon, he lost much of his memories and his will to fight only manifested through a never-ending desire for slaughter and battle with worthy opponents.
</li><li> Sloth: Upper Kizuki 4, Hantengu, being a cowardly cheat who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">feigned blindness to rob and murder kind strangers</span>, manifests his demonic powers by creating younger clones of himself, based around his emotions, and having them do all the neccesary fighting, while his "real" body runs away and waits the fight out.
</li><li> Greed: Upper Kizuki 5, Gyokko, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> artist obsessed with creating the finest "art" and forcing everyone and anyone to observe and adore it. He is also quite picky when it comes to his food and uses his Blood Demon Art to acquire wealth by selling his magical pots to human collectors.
</li><li> Lust: Upper Kizuki 6, Daki, works as an "oiran" (high-class prostitute) in the Red Light District, and has for centuries. As a bonus, she also has a noticeable bloodlust when fighting and is quite vain <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(even if her brother and other half, Gyutaro, is characterised more by his envy of others)</span>.

</li><li> Greed: Ban is an immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleThief">Impossible Thief</a> who can steal things as if he were a magnet. Not just a person's physical possessions, but their stat buffs and things like awareness of pain. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His sin of Greed was a misunderstanding, being accused of burning down a sacred forest that housed the fountain of immortality he sought after, despite the fact that he was, in fact, trying to <em>protect</em> said forest from the true culprit, a demon.

</li><li> Sloth: King is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent">a wingless child-like fairy</a> who is often seen floating around and carrying a pillow.

What people don't know is that he was attempting to save Helbram from the humans who captured him (Helbram managed to escape on his own, but the atrocities he witnessed humans doing to his kind caused him to snap), but because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia">Trauma-Induced Amnesia</a>, King ended up forgetting his friend and his rescue mission, thus Helbram was allowed to carry out his revenge unopposed.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> did this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">the book of Eibon</a>, a book that had the seven sins as chapters and the group ventured to to save Death the Kid. Lust turned the characters into the opposite gender, more specifically into what they viewed as attractive in the opposite gender. The more you were a pervert, the longer you stayed in the opposite gender, which led to the hilarious realization of <em>Tsubaki</em> being the biggest pervert (well, besides Blair.) It was also guarded by a Succubus (who <em>fell</em> for the now male and very handsome Blair, who blasted her out of the way.) Gluttony was based on food and drove them with the desire to indulge. Wrath made anyone who was in it angry and short-tempered, while <em>Excalibur</em> was there, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> justified since he is a Great Old One, specificlaly the one of Madness Born From Anger</span>. Greed was based on money. Envy showed the occupants their fears, insecurities and so on, as seen when Maka got seperated from the others and was bombarded with the chapter attacking her sense of self and exploiting her insecurities over whether she was good enough to be Soul's partner. And Sloth was a distorted chapter where everything just stood still. Pride, the lowest chapter, is where it leads to big occuptant in here, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that tempts people with power, since he is the Great Old One of Madness Born From Power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Death the Kid temporarily succumbed to the Madness of Power, which awoke the Madness of Order in him and believed the ultimate order was nothingness and Black Star had to beat sense into him.</span> The Great Old One also considers a "desire for justice" to be a dangerous "eighth" sin since it could be taken too far and to justify all sorts of atrocities.

<ul><li> Pride: Bankotsu, being the leader of the Band of Seven, states at one point that he "does what he wants with no fear of the afterlife." He's also a big talker, and has the skills to match.
</li><li> Greed: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Renkotsu becomes obsessed with immortality and betrays his team for the jewel shards.</span>

</li><li> Lust: Mukotsu is intent on marrying (but nonetheless raping) Kagome. Jakotsu, who is obsessed with Inuyasha, could also fit.

<ul><li> Envy: Ultear is a time-manipulating mage who will do anything it takes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a> by undoing what she believed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">her mother's abandonment of her in the past</a>.

Her mom brought her to scientists when she was a baby to check what was wrong with her body and said scientists told her she was dead so they could study on her. When a young Ultear escaped, she saw her mom Ur with her students and thought she had been replaced, hence the Envy. Had it not been for her envy and if she alerted her mom, <em>alot</em> of problems would not have happened.</span>
</li><li> Wrath: Zancrow is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> Flame God Slayer who will incinerate anyone who angers him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">for any reason at all</a> - even members of his own guild.
</li><li> Lust: While Meredy is too young to embody this vice (aside from her familial love for Ultear driving her villainy), her Maguilty Sense magic ties in with Lust otherwise, as it connects their bonds with others.
</li><li> Pride: Azuma is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> whose real villainy lies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">taking orders from evil old Master Hades</a>, but all the same, his love of battle causes him to show contempt toward weak opponents and pacifists, and also to take hostages in order to provoke strong opponents into fighting at full power. It ultimately proves his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>, as he willingly decides to gamble Grimoire Heart's all-but-assured victory in order to get the fight of his life out of Fairy Tail's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> Erza, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">holds his pride and honor in such regard</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord">he keeps his word to restore the magic power of Fairy Tail's mages</a> after she defeats him.

</li><li> Sloth: Rustyrose practices Arc of Embodiment, a type of Lost Magic that allows him to create anything that he desires from his imagination, ensuring that he rarely, if ever, needs to engage in hand-to-hand combat.
</li><li> Greed: Zoldeo long ago succumbed to this sin and used a taboo magic to possess the Celestial Spirit Capricorn after having promised Layla Heartfilia, Capricorn's key-holder, that he would pass the key onto Layla's daughter, Lucy, when she was of an appropriate age to wield it.

<ul><li> Pride: Griffith cares only about himself and himself alone. This is best showcased with his speech with the princess Charlotte, in which says that his men are so far beneath him.
</li><li> Greed: Cares only to get as much power as he can and him alone, and betrays his followers so he can get a second shot at gaining a kingdom.
</li><li> Wrath: Betrays all his men to the Godhand in a fit of rage after finding out that they can move on without him, and also rapes Casca in that same fit of rage.
</li><li> Lust: As Guts points out, Griffith won't stop at just gaining a country; he is addicted to performing all these heroic acts because it glorifies his ego and will always want more.
</li><li> Sloth: Has his men do most of his dirty work.
</li><li> Gluttony: As Guts points out, Griffith won't stop at just getting a country; he will <em>always</em> crave higher goals to feed his ever-growing ego, which was probably why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he cracked open the astral plane and fused it with the physical world, turning an already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> into a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth">Hell on Earth</a>, so that his rule that is Falconia will ultimately consume the whole world, making him the sole ruler</span>.
</li><li> Envy: Has displayed intensely jealous behavior towards Guts and Casca, and rapes the latter to spite the former for having dared leave the Band of the Hawks upon becoming Femto.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion">Castle Town Dandelion</a></em>, Misaki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower">Royalty Superpower</a> allows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">Literal Split Personality</a> along the lines of the seven sins. Unlike most examples here, her clone for Lust is an <em>actual</em> embodiment of that sin; that clone makes sexual comments all the time, and in one memorable incident, asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">Misaki's twin brother to comfort her sexually</a>.

<ul><li> Lust: Azazel Atsuhi, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">perverted</a> Satyr demon.
</li><li> Gluttony: Beelzebub Yuichi, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">shit-eating</a> fly demon.
</li><li> Greed: Salamander Kimitake, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">Straw Misogynist</a>.
</li><li> Wrath: Moloch Yoshinobu, a bad-tempered cow demon.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero">Re:Zero</a></em> has the Sin Archbishops of the Witch's Cult, as well as the Witches of Sin. The Witches were the original bearers of the so called "Authorities", unique magical powers inherited through absorbing the "witch factors" after the previous holder's death. After the Witch of Envy, Satella, went insane and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> supposedly</span> killed and devoured the other Witches, the factors wound up inherited by the Archbishops of the nascent Witch's Cult, an organisation <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> supposedly</span> dedicated to the worship of the Witch of Envy. Note that, though the Authorities will always display a power vaguely themed after their aligned sin, the strength and exact nature of the ability depend heavily upon the user. Since Satella is still technically alive, there never was an Archbishop of Envy. All the Authority bearers are named after important stars or constellations in Earth's night sky, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which strongly hints at an explicit connection between them and the protagonist Subaru Natsuki, whose name is the Japanese word for the Pleiades cluster.</span>
<ul><li> Witch of Envy: Satella, the dreaded Witch who devoured the other six and swallowed half the world, before being narrowly stopped and sealed away by the Dragon, the Sage and the Sword Saint. She acts as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatanicArchetype">Satanic Archetype</a> of the setting, with the other Witches largely forgotten by the modern age. The nature of her original Authority of Envy is unknown, but she seems to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers">been able to utilise variations of other Authorities</a> as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She is also the one to gift the protagonist, Subaru Natsuki, with his power after summoning him to her world.</span>
</li><li> Witch of Greed: Echidna, a self proclaimed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">very evil magic user</a>" obsessed with satisfying her endless greed for knowledge by any means neccesary. Though the nature of Echidna's Authority remains unknown, she is known to have been an exceptionally gifted natural magic user, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is the author of the Tomes of Wisdom, magical books with the power to predict the future of their holders. The modern Witch's Cult uses lesser versions of these, known as "Gospels", although their accuracy compared to the genuine product remains a matter of debate.</span>
</li><li> Witch of Pride: Typhon, a little girl whose life goal is "judging" other people for their sins and crimes. However, due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">skewed and childish view on justice</a>, she wound up killing uncounted innocents, making no distinction between the severity and context of any individual crime. Her Authority apparently manifests via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyShatteredLives">breaking apart the bodies</a> of those she deems "bad people".
</li><li> Witch of Wrath: Minerva, an ostensibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">affable</a> Witch whose stated goal was to rid the world of pain and suffering. To that end, her Authority was capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">instantly restoring anyone she punched to perfect health</a>, as well as granting her super-strength and speed. However, the mana required to perform these feats was drawn directly from the world's atmosphere, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">causing untold natural disasters and general misfortune to occur in other random locations</a>. Due to this, Minerva was, ironically, one of the most hated Witches of her generation.
</li><li> Witch of Lust: Carmilla, an extremely self-conscious, shy and frail young woman, described as being "cute" rather than outright beautiful. Her Authority, the "Faceless Bride", manifested through the people spotting her becoming literally unable to tear their eyes away from her, entranced enough by her presence to forget how to speak, eat or even breath, eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">dying in the process</a>. Her secondary abilities include appearing to specific people in the guise of their loved ones and helping them "understand" the feelings of others, as she did to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subaru in order to help him understand Satella's love for him</span>.
</li><li> Witch of Gluttony: Daphne, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">Ambiguously Human</a> young girl with an insatiable hunger and a rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueandOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueandOrangeMorality">darwinist approach to life</a> who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is responsible for creating the demonic witchbeasts prowling the world, in a misguided effort to end world hunger</span>. Her Authority apparently manifests by invoking maddening hunger in anyone who touches or makes eye contact with her (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the Web Novel, Subaru bites his own fingers off without noticing after getting hit with a small dose of her power</span>).
</li><li> Witch of Sloth: Sekhmet, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">Lazy Bum</a> extraordinaire who finds it bothersome to even speak. Ironically, her power is noted by the author to be second only to Satella's among the Witches, yet she is too lazy to do much of anything with it - even if she did drive away the Divine Dragon at one point, purely because Volcanica was bothering her. The exact nature of her version of the Sloth Authority is never confirmed, though it seems to be a powerful version of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Unseen Hand"</span>.
</li><li> Witch of Vainglory: Pandora, a mysterious Witch who doesn't appear to be directly affiliated with the other Witches, but serves as a benefactor of sorts to the later Witch's Cult. Her Authority manifests as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">reality warping</a>, wherein she can instantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeleportation">teleport people</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">tamper with others' memories</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateDead">revive corpses into an undead state</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromtheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromtheDead">undo her own death after being reduced to a greasy smudge</a></span>. There are likely limits to her power, as she doesn't appear completely omnipotent, but any such are as of yet unspecified.
</li><li> Warlock of Melancholy: Hector, an elusive character who at one point hunted for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Echidna</span> and came to blows with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the original Roswaal Mathers</span>. Little is known about him, including his current status and whereabouts. His Authority manifests through creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">immensely powerful gravity fields</a> he can freely maniulate.
</li><li> Archbishop of Greed: Regulus Corneas, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> obsessed with his "rights and privileges", Regulus is considered the strongest Authority user barring Satella herself. His version of the Authority of Greed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Stillness of an Object's Time</a>", can stop the time of anything he touches or breaths</span>, making him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">effectively invulnerable</a> and capable of producing unblockable, extremely destructive attacks. The only downside to this is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his heart is stopped as well whenever using the ability</span> - to counter this, his secondary ability, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Small King", allows him to "hide" his heart within the chest of one of his "subjects" (one of his many, many wives), effectively borrowing a working heart</span> and allowing him to use his primary ability without limit.
</li><li> Archibishop of Sloth: Petelgeuse Romanee-Conti, a crazed zealot dedicated towards "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFreak">repaying the Witch's love</a>" and apparently the only Archbishop <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fully intent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">engineering Satella's escape from her prison</a></span>. His Authority manifests as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "Unseen Hand", an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">invisible force field in the shape of a hand</a> which he can manipulate freely. He was also able to combine these to change their shape and size</span>. The strength and number of these depend upon the user - Petelgeuse was said to be able to generate one hundred of these and was regarded as the weakest of the Archbishops.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This was due to his nature being in many ways the polar opposite of his Authority, causing him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">deteriorate physically and mentally</a> after absorbing it in the heat of battle.</span>
</li><li> Archbishop of Wrath: Sirius, a creepy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithaCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithaCrush">stalker</a> obsessed with Petelgeuse, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageMummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandageMummy">covered head-to-toe in bandages</a> and uses golden chains as her primary offensive weapon. Her Authority allows her not only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">set these on fire at will</a>, but also to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionBomb">transmit, intensify and link emotions and sensations between people</a>, often to the point of insanity. The nastiest side effect of this, however, is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if anyone under the effect of the Authority dies - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Sirius very much included</a> - all those affected will die in the same manner, regardless of circumstance</span>. She is also possessed of an unnaturally long lifespan and is said to be the physically strongest of the Archbishops.
</li><li> Archbishop of Lust: Capella Emerada Lugnica, an exceptionally bratty, foul-mouthed and generally unbearable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">heavily implied to have been a member of - and responsible for the extinction of - the former Lugunican Royal Family</span>. Her Authority, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">Variation and Change</a>", allows her to transform herself or anyone else into whatever form she desires, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">replace lost body parts on the fly</a> and reduce her foes into disgusting globs of flesh. Commonly, she uses the form of a young woman wearing nothing but skimpy bikini <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">heavily reminiscent of Felt</span>. She also seems to be the one in charge of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the assassin guild to which Elsa and Meili belonged to, under the guise of "Mama"</span>.
</li><li> Archbishop/s of Gluttony: Ley Batenkaitos, Roy Alphard and Louis Arneb. Unlike the other authorities, the Authority of Gluttony is divided equally between three "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingsInCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingsInCrime">siblings</a>", though their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyHuman">Ambiguously Human</a> nature makes their exact status hard to determine. Louis in particular <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is merely a disembodied soul trapped within the Corridor of Memories, only being able to interact with the outside world by possesing the bodies of her "brothers"</span>. Their Authority manifests in several ways. The Gluttonies are capable of eating a person's name, memories or both. If the name is eaten, the owner is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">forgotten by the surrounding world</a>, being unable to interact with others, use magic or form contracts with Spirits. If the memories are eaten, the person becomes amnesiac and loses most of their defining characteristics, effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossofIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossofIdentity">erasing their identity</a>. If both are eaten, the person enters suspended animation, no longer aging or needing to eat or excrete, with everyone around them forgetting everything about them. It also allows them to use the Eclipse powers - the Lunar Eclipse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers">utilise the victim's memories to channel their skills and certain powers</a>, and the Solar Eclipse to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">physically transform into their victim</a>, though Louis seems to be the only one of the three not averse to utilising the latter. The Authority also allows them a limited form of direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">control over witchbeasts</a>, most notably the White Whale, which they use to cover any Witch's Cult operations they undertake.
</li><li> Archbishop of Pride: Currently vacant, with many both in-universe and out speculating that the Authority of Pride has been granted to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subaru himself by the Witch of Envy, Satella, in the form of his "Return by Death"</span>. Stride Vollachia, a foreign noble and former heir to the Vollachian Empire, was the last known holder, however Stride only features in a prequel novel and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousCharacter">long dead</a> by the time the main plot begins. Though Stride possessed a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Gospel"</span>, the nature of his version of the Authority of Pride remains unknown.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SevenMortalSins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SevenMortalSins">Seven Mortal Sins</a></em>: This show deals with Demon Lords who represent the Sins, through there are actually nine of them, borrowing two sins from Ponticus list of "evil thoughts". The show likes to explore how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVirtues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVirtues">the sins can be made into virtues</a> while also serving as the weakness of the Demon Lords when they are taken too far.
<ul><li> Lucifer is Pride. She was an angel cast out of Heaven for her overwhelming arrogance, but she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">Smug Super</a> as she has the power to back up her boasts. After arriving in hell, she decides to take it over to prove her superiority. Because she believes she's better than everyone, she can shrug off any pain or attempts to control her mentally. However, this arrogance also often leads her to taking the hard way as she wants to prove her power. For example, when she was trapped in a torture device, Leviathan attempted to free her, but she said she wanted to prove she could escape on her own. She succeeds, but it takes several hours.
</li><li> Leviathan is Envy. She is in love with Lucifer and cannot stand anyone getting in the way of that, especially Lucifer's human servant Maria Totsuka, whom Lucifer seems to favor more. Maria points out that deep inside, all Leviathan wants is to be loved, and wanting love isn't a sin, weakening her.
</li><li> Belial is Vanity. She's the self-proclaimed leader and constantly brags that she's the most beautiful, powerful, etc. However, she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> as she's not nearly as powerful as she thinks she is and the other sins don't take her seriously. She's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmlessVillain">Not-So-Harmless Villain</a> though, and most of her persona is a facade.
</li><li> Satan is Wrath. She's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> and very aggressive. She gets stronger the more people around her feel angry and she can command wrathful people like soldiers as minions. Lucifer just beats her in a straight up fight while pointing out giving in to anger made Satan make mistakes and leave herself open. When Belial punishes her for treason, she traps Satan in a pool of the mashed up flesh of all the people she has ever killed, and they are still conscious and eager to get revenge on her by groping and torturing her.
</li><li> Asmodeus is Lust. She enslaves humans (male and female) with both her looks and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingAphrodisiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingAphrodisiac">Living Aphrodisiac</a> powers and gets stronger the more people feel lust around her. Lucifer points out lust is nothing but a natural body reaction and so it isn't really a sin. When Belial punishes her for treason, she has Asmodeus tied up naked and shibari style while floating around in a tornado that flays her body with its high speed winds. While it is indeed painful, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooKinkyToTorture">Too Kinky to Torture</a> and gets off on it.
</li><li> Mammon is Greed. She runs both a real estate and potion selling business on Earth, charging absurdly high prices. When she claims someone with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>, she confiscates all their assets. She cannot stand anyone stealing or damaging her stuff. Maria finds out that her obsession with wealth comes from the fact that she has over <em>500,000 demonic children</em> she needs to take care of and the numerous people she enslaves are made into babysitters for them. While Maria recognizes that her greed is justified as it comes from motherly love, she manages to convince her to ease up on the money collecting for a bit and actually spend time with her children. When Belial punishes her for treason, Mammon is trapped on an iron horse torture device made out of her melted down gold, with bags of gold coins as the weights.
</li><li> Beelezbub is Gluttony. She is a short, petite girl who eats enormous amounts of food all the time without getting fat. She isn't really evil and just enjoys eating. Lucifer challenges her to an eating contest, which ends in a tie when they both get hospitalized for overeating. When Belial punishes her for treason, Beelezbub is restrained by two burly demons and repeatedly subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFeeding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForceFeeding">Force Feeding</a>, which she doesn't enjoy since she is constantly choking.
</li><li> Belphegor is Sloth. She spends most of her time loafing around playing with a smart phone, and when Lucifer invaded their stronghold, she didn't care and had to be convinced to fight. She tempts mortals with a virtual reality video game world adventure, so fun that they never want to leave, neglecting school, work, etc. She loses when the game is finally beaten, causing all of the players to finally leave. Afterwards, she is too lazy to try anything else. When Belial punishes her for treason, Belphegor is trapped on a treadmill and blasted with flamethrowers every time she tries to stop or escape.
</li><li> Astaroth is Melancholy. She is both very shy and apathetic, and doesn't really care about Hell's cause or tempting mortals to sin. She is a singer on Earth, and Lucifer defeats her peacefully in a musical showdown. However, her songs have very depressing lyrics, and they can indeed drain people's happiness if she chooses.

<ul><li> Pride: Asuka Langley Soryuu. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her incredibly arrogant and egotistical attitude blinds her from the ability to work with others, and her attempting to mend her shattered pride after being bested by Shinji was what lead to her infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>. Additionally, her refusing to help Shinji when he was as his lowest was what leads to him snapping and triggering the Third Impact. When she <em>does</em> finally realize how much she has hurt everyone around her, it's too late to make amends.</span>
</li><li> Greed: Gendo Ikari. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His entire goal is to bring back his dead wife, not caring what happens to anyone else. Rei calls him out on this selfish desire and subsequently kills him.</span>
</li><li> Wrath: Shinji Ikari. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Numerous times, Shinji has gotten in trouble due to his bouts of rage whenever he piloted an EVA Unit. After being pushed one too many, he snaps out of rage towards everything else and triggers the Third Impact.</span>
</li><li> Lust: Misato Katsuragi. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Misato leads a borderline hedonistic do-whatever-she-pleases lifestyle as a coping mechanism for her particularly low self-esteem.</span>
</li><li> Sloth: Rei Ayanami. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When not piloting an EVA Unit, Rei is seldom seen doing anything. Her sloth is best reflected with her room, where it's very disorganized and messy-looking. Her being raised as being disposable leaves her unable to work with others as a team, leading to her death several times.</span>
</li><li> Gluttony: Keel Lorenz. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Instrumentality, which Keel has planned for, will result in everyone being consumed into the LCL pool. While Keel does, in a basic sense, succeed in having the humans assimilated, Shinji gives humans the ability to rematerialize themselves back to life, and as Keel cannot live for long without his implants, he will be stuck there forever.</span>
</li><li> Envy: Ritsuko Akagi. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She has displayed intensely jealous behavior over Gendo, and killed the Rei clones so she can get closer to him. She is ultimately killed by the very person that she was jealous over: Gendo.</span>
</li><li> And all of them suffer the Eighth Sin of Despair.
</li></ul></li><li> It's subtle, but some of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilmanCrybaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilmanCrybaby">DEVILMAN crybaby</a></em> represent a certain vice, which also ends up being their undoing.
<ul><li> Pride: Ryo/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satan</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His Darwinian mindset, his contempt for humanity and their virtues, and his plans to overthrow God blinds him to what he truly desires. When he does finally get what he <em>thought</em> he wants, only then he realizes too late what his plans had cost him and all he can do is grieve about it.</span>
</li><li> Wrath: Akira. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Akira's greatest strength lies in his empathy; however, Miki's death broke him so much that he can no longer shed tears for the pain of others. While he doesn't turn his back on humanity, he now fights in the name of revenge and anger rather than love and understanding, and he eventually meets his end at Satan's hands.</span>
</li><li> Envy: Miko. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Her resentment at Miki upstaging her in everything caused her to become a Devilman, which spurred on her ego and made her act purely out of self-interest. What differs her from the rest is that while she also dies, she was able to redeem herself beforehand by confiding to Miki her true feelings and reconciling with her.</span>
</li><li> Sloth: Moyuru. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He has no interest in fighting for either demons or humans, and only prioritizes his own survival. Not long after, he suffers a brutal death when he sides with the demons purely out of self-preservation.</span>
</li><li> Lust: Silene. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After finding about that Akira is Amon's newest host, she seduces Akira in an attempt to reunite with Amon — which is what does her in, since when she calls for Amon to awaken and take her, Akira responds by brutalizing her via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterplayOfSexAndViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterplayOfSexAndViolence">Interplay of Sex and Violence</a> to the point that her death is only a matter of minutes.</span>
</li><li> Gluttony: Taro. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> While it's his excessive curiosity that made him a Devilman, his lack of knowledge in how to deal with his change made him incapable of containing his hunger, leading him to eat his mother... just as his father catches him in the act, and they all end up dead when the military spots them.</span>
</li><li> Greed: Nagasaki. The standard photographer character trying to get a big scoop by investigating dangerous events. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">How else are things</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">going to end for him?</a>

However, in a twist, Lust and Goma, the ones who represent lust and pride were killed long before the story began, so youre just left with Ira (wrath), Marmo (greed), Bel (sloth), Leva (envy), and Gula (gluttony).

Over the years they've periodically broken free and Captain Marvel has had to fight them and seal them up. Lust was originally replaced by Injustice, and this was only changed in the JLA/JSA crossover below.
<ul><li> One DC storyline associated each sin with a specific DC Hero, as seen <a class="urllink" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5e/c1/67/5ec167af86bf1d2d05a74ce9262f2c1e.jpg">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mr Terrific was Pride, Hal Jordan was Envy, Plastic Man was Greed, Batman was Wrath, Dr Fate was Sloth, Power Girl was Lust, and Captain Marvel himself was Gluttony.</span>

</li><li> The 2009 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> annuals feature a group of seven villains who call themselves La Saglia (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">acronym</a> of the Latin names of the sins), and seek to awaken the Eighth Sin. Any connection to the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man is unknown.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a>: Together, Together Forever</em>, six sons of Trigon sired from human mothers at around the same time as Raven have emotion-manipulating powers based on the sins. They try to awaken Raven's evil side and get her to join up. In an open defiance of convention, the one female in the group <em>isn't</em> lust; Raven instead filled the "pride" slot (implied because she is viewed as Trigon's pride a la daddy's little girl or perhaps because she is the most powerful.) Stuck on evil mode, Raven later tried to transfer her brother's abilities to the Titans. Donna Troy got stuck with Lust, rather than the more obvious choice of Starfire. This was a reference to the fact that Donna has gone through multiple relationships and been the object of desire of many men, even more so than Starfire. Cyborg was Wrath, which seemed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryBlackMan">Angry Black Man</a> trope. Red Arrow got Gluttony, and while he became fat as a result, this was a possible reference to his former heroin addiction, thrill seeking, and womanizing tendencies, fitting in with Gluttony's nature of excessive consumption.
</li><li> Deadly Six is a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuicideSquad">Suicide Squad</a> who can induce six of the seven sins in people (sloth makes people lazy, for instance).

Byrna Brilyant uses her inventions to threaten communities out of their money due to Greed. Queen Clea's Lust for men and power threw two Atlantean principalities into war and caused her to abduct entire shiploads of men, strip them, keep the submissive ones and devise scantly clad executions for the others for her own entertainment. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cheetah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cheetah">Cheetah</a>'s Envy whenever others received more attention than her drove her to murder before she ever donned a costume and villain name. Dr. Poison's Pride in her work is such that she can't understand when someone tries to call her out for how horrific it is. Eviless became a slave driver as it was a simple job that allowed her to order others to do all the work, she then becomes a full fledged villain to get revenge when parts of her job becomes illegal as she doesn't want to have to go through the work of adapting to the new guidelines due to her Sloth. Giganta's every action revolves around her Wrath. Zara's Gluttony for the finer things in life causes her downfall when she has no patience about spending her ill gotten gains.

Each head represented a different Deadly Sin, and their sometimes conflicting motivations were his greatest weakness.
</li><li> A French graphic novel, <em>Seven Monks</em>, told the story of seven Irish monks, each embodying one of the deadly sins, receiving punishment for their sins by being sent to convert a village of pagan vikings. Incredibly, by applying their sinful behaviors in creative ways (the avaricious monk uses the lure of profitable trading with Byzantium, the envious monk convinces the chieftain's second-in-command to take over upon his death, the lustful monk seduces every woman in the village, and so on) and with some incredible coincidences, they succeed in their mission without changing their ways in the slightest.

Bliss, a spoiled rich girl, was Greed. Powerhaus, who feeds off ambient emotions to get stronger, was Gluttony. Evo, a monster man with an attitude problem, was Wrath. Frostbite, a pessimist who doesn't care about anything, was Sloth. Copycat, the girl with multiple personalities whose only friend is herself, was Pride, and Sublime, a supermodel type who longed for the attention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13">Gen¹³</a> member Grunge, was Envy.

Interestingly (and somewhat like <em>7DS</em> above), the protagonists manage to both play their sin straight and subvert it at the same time. The Wailing Seven themselves are:
<ul><li> Beezle: A Drillbur who represents Gluttony.

</li><li> Belfee: A Psyduck who represents Sloth. He is carefree, lax, and chill, and will often procrasinate majorly to do things. However, he's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusDitz">much cleverer</a> than anyone gives him credit for and can improvise on the fly really well; he often will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyver">MacGyver</a> weapons out of everyday objects without needing to really do anything. While the rest of the crew berates him for his procrasination, he will usually respond with "Mozart did it, and he made a masterpiece. Why can't I?" Named for Belphegor.

Shy, soft-spoken, and a giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, Levy has a deep desire to become a successful member of the Wailing Seven like the rest of his buddies. He has a lot of goals for himself, but often has crippling self-esteem that he can't possibly achieve those goals. This only fuels his envy, which only fuels his persistence. Named for Leviathan.
</li><li> Mammo: A Sableye who represents Greed. Mischevious, snarky, and of course greedy as all get out- he is obsessed with currency and desires to get as much money as possible. Where the subversion comes in, of course, is <em>why</em> he's so greedy: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's poor, and needs money to sustain himself, his family, and the rest of the crew.</span> Named for Mammon.

<ul><li> Pride: In the first line no less to justify his actions (Of my virtue I am justly proud.)
</li><li> Lust: The whole premise of the song is his sexual desire for Esmeralda.
</li><li> Greed: He never cares for Esmeralda and only sees her as an object of affection that he wants without actually needing her.

<ul><li> The film revolved somewhat around the nature of sin, with the Operative remarking on what he perceived to be his victims' sins, and the attempt to eliminate sin <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being the cause behind the deaths of thirty million people and the creation of the Reavers.</span>
</li><li> Oddly enough the sins of the Operative's enemies were perceived quite well. Dr Matthias was Prideful enough to display the work he'd done on River to key members of Parliament without thinking of the consequences.
<div class="indent"><strong>The Operative</strong>: Key members of Parliament. <em>Key.</em> The minds behind every military, diplomatic, and covert operation in the galaxy, and you put them in a room with a <em>psychic.</em>
</div><ul><li> But the Alliance's sin of trying to eliminate sin by mere human effort would certainly be Pride as Shepherd Book would note. Especially as it took them <em>several years</em> to realize they'd spilled their beans in River's head.
</li></ul></li><li> And as Mal admitted, his sin is Wrath; he's not easy to piss off, but when someone hammers his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>, he loses all sense and applies all his efforts towards retaliation.

<div class="indent"><strong>Fanty</strong>: You run when you oughta fight, fight when you oughta deal Makes a businessperson a little twitchy.
</div></li><li> The point that Joss was trying to make with the film (which he makes clear in the commentary) is that while the Seven Deadly Sins are bad, they are also inseparable from human nature. The Alliance thought that sin was something that could be stamped out (which was a sin in and of itself, as pointed out above) and the result was Miranda: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a world where everyone was either dead or completely inhuman.</span>

Ray threatens with violence all the time (Wrath); Mamooli talks about his desire to have sex with women from every country (Lust), Jason Flemyng says that the group will "kick ass and take names" as well as taunts a monster and claims it is nothing (Pride); Hanover is paranoid, distrustful and later ends up shooting at someone who is going to live and not him (Envy); Mason is seen stuffing money into his pockets (Greed); and Billy complains about all the work he has to do (Sloth).

Albeit, he was just a kid when he offed them. Also Vince, somewhat. In addition to being bitter about his condition and the fact that he's not making profiler, he decides to drag Sarah's hopes down by revealing that she won't, either. Plus, he's never without his gun.</span>
</li><li> Wrath: The killer obviously has this in spades. That aside, everyone pulls a gun on everybody else for most of the movie and Nicole takes this one to the next level when she suspects <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sarah</span> of being the killer.
</li><li> Pride: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">J.D. always has to take the lead; Lucas paraphrases <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>: "I'm the best at what I do."; Bobby is a mechanical/technical whiz and readily flaunts this.</span>
</li><li> Greed: Gabe doesn't approve of how taxpayers' (apparently including his) hard-earned dollars are spent. JD's need to be the leader could be another type of Greed, in the form of attention and recognition.
</li><li> Sloth: Aside from J.D., no one lifts a finger to help Nicole prepare dinner. Particularly frowning on Gabe here, since he's an unexpected and uninvited guest. Vince also refuses to trust anyone - which is a different form of Sloth - though in this case someone overcoming their sin, Vince trusting Gabe with his gun, is what saves them from the trap.

He proceeds to show Colin, on a giant television screen, each of these sins in action (played out by fantasy versions of Colin, his sweetheart Crepes Suzette, and those around them).
</li><li> A recurring theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostShip">Ghost Ship</a></em>. The villain explains he was given his job to collect souls for Hell because he lived a very sinful life, and he tries to trick people into committing sins to doom their souls.
<ul><li> Envy: It's made quite clear that the gold bars are stolen loot, but the salvagers don't care, just declaring "hey, we're in international waters, so finder's keepers!". The crew of the <em>Graza</em> are so hungry for it that they murder everyone else onboard to obtain it.
</li><li> Gluttony: Dodge and Munder, two of the guys from the <em>Arctic Warrior</em>, start mowing down on old cans of rice they find in the kitchens of the <em>Graza</em>. They're soon rewarded when they realize it's been infested with maggots.
</li><li> Greed: What started the whole thing, to get the gold and live a rich life, going so far as to murder for it. The villain uses this as his main weapon against his victims.
</li><li> Lust: Francesca uses her allure to drive men to murder for her, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unwittingly kill themselves trying to know her biblically.</span>
</li><li> Pride: The ghost crowd gets Greer to drop his guard by applauding him in the middle of the restored, pristine lounge room as if he were the man of the night. Murphy's acquaintance with a mutual ship captain also plays with this subtly.
</li><li> Sloth: Dodge and Munder are constantly playing "rock, paper, scissors" to get the other guy to do the job at hand.
</li><li> Wrath: The crew of the <em>Graza</em> indulge in this to insane degrees, turning the ship into a slaughterhouse by murdering the passengers and the rest of the crew en masse in sadistically cruel ways.

</li><li> In <strong>Envy</strong>, a pools-winning couple find their dream home, but the owners aren't willing to sell. They do all they can to make the owners leave, and succeed by convincing them it is scheduled for demolition, only to find that it really is.
</li><li> <strong>Gluttony</strong> is about Dickie, who hates the slimming biscuits he sells and so hides nicer food items around his office. He is more interested in them than his gorgeous boss's very unsubtle advances and finally loses out on her to his doctor.
</li><li> In <strong>Lust</strong>, Ambrose tries to chat up a woman by calling her phone booth from the next one, claiming it must be a crossed line and then convincing her that he is a childhood friend. It seems to work until she tells him about the scary, monkey-like man in the next booth.
</li><li> In <strong>Pride</strong>, two motorists are stuck facing each other in a narrow country lane. Neither is willing to back-up to a layby so the other can pass. A policeman eventually forces both of them to back-up.
</li><li> <strong>Sloth</strong> takes the form of some silent black-and-white clips of people being lazy, including a man who would rather wait for a tree to fall down than walk around it.
</li><li> In <strong>Wrath</strong>, two men attempt to kill a park-keeper who told them off for littering. They ultimately succeed, but are themselves killed in the process and find themselves in hell. The park-keeper turns out to be the Devil.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shazam2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shazam2019">SHAZAM! (2019)</a></em>, as in the above-mentioned comics, the Seven Deadly Sins are sealed in statues within the Rock of Ages. They use Thaddeus Sivana to free them, and possess Sivana to grant him powers comparable to Shazam as well as being able to manifest physically. Sivana's father represented greed, so Sivana had Greed kill him for irony. Lust, rather than Injustice, is among them, though it is a hideous demon like the others with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongTongue">hideous lolling tongue</a>, and Billy lampshades the common portrayal by commenting he expected it to be "hotter". In the climax, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Billy exploits their nature by taunting Envy, who had remained within Sivana after all the others manifested, about being weaker than its fellows so it would emerge to attack him and leave Sivana powerless.</span>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">Older Than Print</a>: In Dante's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a> </em>, the Mount of Purgatory (described in the <em>Purgatorio</em>, the second part of the <em>Comedy</em>, where sinners who repented before death are purged of their sins) is arranged around the Seven Deadly Sins, from most-serious to least-serious (in Dante's evaluation):
<dl><dd><ul><li> The Proud, on the First (lowest) Terrace, walk carrying heavy stones on their backs, so that they cannot stand straight or look down on anyone else.
</li><li> The Envious, on the Second Terrace of Purgatory have their eyes sewn shut. In life they envied what they saw; to purge their sin, they see nothing.
</li><li> The Wrathful are on the Third Terrace, where they walk constantly, blinded by acrid smoke.
</li><li> The Slothful are on the Fourth Terrace, being purged of their sin by constant running.
</li><li> The Avaricious are on the Fifth Terrace, lying face down on the ground. This is generally considered a breaking point: the previous four sins were all about perverted or deficient love and are considered more severe, while this sin and the two that follow are all about excessive love for material things and are more excusable (although Dante thought it was a stupid sin to be guilty of).
</li><li> The Gluttonous are on the Sixth Terrace and their penance is to pass through groves of fruit and by waterfalls of pure water without eating or drinking.
</li><li> The Lustful are on the Seventh and last Terrace of the Mount of Purgatory, where their sin is purged from them in a wall of fire. They run through this in two directions: those who lusted after the opposite sex in one direction, those who lusted after the same sex in the other. (Yes. What?)
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> The <em>Inferno</em> is not strictly arranged according to the Seven Deadly Sins, although some do show up. Dante's Hell is divided between Incontinence (inability to control one's appetites) Violence (in three flavors- against others, against yourself, and against nature), and Fraud. The sins of Incontinence are the ones that align with the Seven Deadly Sins:
<ul><li> The unrepentant Lustful are in the Second Circle of Hell, constantly blown about by winds, symbolizing their surrender in life to their desires of the moment.
</li><li> The unrepentant Gluttonous the Third Circle of the Inferno, where they lie in a slush of rain, hail, and ash, symbolizing the foul waste of their lives.
</li><li> The unrepentant Avaricious (both the greedy and the squanderers) are in the Fourth Circle of Hell, pushing large, heavy weights at and into each other.
</li><li> The unrepentant Slothful and Wrathful are in the Fifth Circe of Hell, which is the River Styx. The Slothful lie beneath the surface of the river, sunk in the slime and mud of the riverbed; the Wrathful are on the surface, tearing and yelling at each other as they swim. In this case, Dante folded Sloth into variant of Wrath as "Sullenness", ie, "passively wrathful": where your own anger makes you unable to see life's joys.
</li></ul></li><li> As for the other circles and sins:
<ul><li> The First Circle is Limbo, whose inhabitants aren't guilty of anything other than "not being Christian". As a result, they aren't tortured and don't really figure into the analysis.
</li><li> Circles 2-5 address sins of uncontrolled desires.
</li><li> Circles 6-9 address the sins of he who consciously seeks injustice and "by force or fraud bring harm to other men." Envy and pride are divided over several types of these sins—heresy,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7k53j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7k53j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7k53j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Pride: You think you know better than the Deep Mind Himself?</span> suicide<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note877fk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note877fk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note877fk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Pride: You think your life is worthless when it was loved into being by God?</span>, simony,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9y53e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9y53e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9y53e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Pride, Envy, and Avarice all in one: you think you can <em>buy</em> the position of God's representative on Earth?</span> etc.

Sayers</a> lays them all out and explains them in her essay "The Other Six Deadly Sins" (other than Lust, that is, which is the one that gets all the attention).
</li><li> The premise of Gregory Walter's <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Ordeals-Gregory-Tomas-Walter/dp/1466230568/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1395946777&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=seven+ordeals/">The Seven Ordeals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> centers around a priest being challenged by the Seven Lords of Hell, each representing a sin, and each secretly trying to tempt him during his quest to the Mountain of the Gods. They appear in order of severity.
<ul><li> Sloth — represented by the hermaphroditic Belphagor, disguised as an indifferent inventor.
</li><li> Gluttony — represented by Beelzebub, disguised as a merchant cannibal.
</li><li> Lust — Asmodeus, the one who suggested the game. Plays the part of a pimp, but also cuts a deal with Leviathan.
</li><li> Greed — Mammon, offers a game of chance to the priest.
</li><li> Envy — a female iteration of Leviathan, cast as a witch.
</li><li> Wrath — Natas Amon, a masked warlord that traumatizes Peter.
</li><li> Pride — Reficul, shapeshifts into a classic depiction of a seraphim, at the base of the Mountain.

</li><li> Each of the main characters in Tom Harris' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hannibal">Hannibal</a></em> series represents a Deadly Sin. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightinSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightinSourArmor">Clarice</a> is Pride, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Hannibal Lecter</a> himself is Gluttony, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Pazzi</a> is Greed, Mason Verger is Wrath, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Frederick Chilton</a> is Sloth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">Jame Gumb</a> is Envy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerofWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerofWorlds">Francis Dolarhyde</a> is Lust.
</li><li> Garth Nix's seven-part <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KeysToTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KeysToTheKingdom">Keys to the Kingdom</a></em> series features a different villain in each one, named after a different day. Since the breaking of the Will, each of these Trustees has also been afflicted by a particular Deadly Sin.
<ul><li> Monday is <strong>Sloth</strong> — he allows his dominion to fall apart because he can't be bothered to do anything about it.
</li><li> Tuesday is <strong>Avarice</strong> — he is desperate for Nothing, the raw material of everything, and his mining operations almost makes his Realm collapse into the Void.
</li><li> Wednesday is <strong>Gluttony</strong> — she is cursed to eat constantly and has swollen to become a giant whale.
</li><li> Thursday is <strong>Wrath</strong> — he flies into a rage at the drop of a hat, and actually killed his subordinates when they were incapacitated by a spell. When an officer points out they'll need trials before he can kill the entire team, he knocks her teeth out.
</li><li> Friday is <strong>Lust</strong> — she is addicted to mortal experiences and uses her magic to steal them.
</li><li> Saturday is <strong>Envy</strong> — she is resentful that Sunday rules the House, when she is the elder of the two.
</li><li> Sunday is <strong>Pride</strong>. Thus far, he has refused to get involved in the battle for the House, believing there can only one result, and instead delights in his demesne, the Incomparable Gardens, and is fond of showing Saturday brief glimpses of it. He also controls the most powerful of the Seven Keys.
</li></ul></li><li> Many people believe the four bad children from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> to be representatives of sin: Augustus Gloop is gluttony, Veruca Salt is greed and envy, Mike Teavee is wrath and sloth, and Violet Beauregard is pride.
<ul><li> Interestingly, in the 2005 movie adaptation several of the <em>parents</em> also have a dominant sin. Mrs. Gloop as pride - though for Augustus, not herself - Mr. Salt as sloth, and Ms. Beauregard quite explicitly as lust.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a>. In the country of Lancre, one family went and named their daughters after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenHeavenlyVirtues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenHeavenlyVirtues">Seven Heavenly Virtues</a>, Faith, Hope, Charity, Prudence so forth. And out of a misinformed sense of continuity, named their sons along the lines of Bestiality and Anger (among others). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted, because each of the daughters came to embody the sin opposite of her virtuous name. Meanwhile, despite everything else, Anger is a kind and calm man, while his brother Bestiality is kind to animals.</span>
<ul><li> Also, in <em>Going Postal</em>, it turns out that there are actually eight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenHeavenlyVirtues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenHeavenlyVirtues">virtues</a>: Patience, Chastity, Silence, Charity, Hope, Fortitude, Tubso, and Bissonomy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10cfnq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10cfnq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10cfnq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> We don't know what those last two are either.

</li><li> A street in Ankh-Morpork, near the University, is named <em>eight deadly Sins</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Some people have argued that each book in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em> focus on one of the seven deadly sins:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></em>: <strong>Gluttony</strong> since Edmund betrays his siblings for magical candy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceCaspian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceCaspian">Prince Caspian</a></em>: <strong>Lust</strong> in the form of luxury; the Telmarines want a highly ordered and civilized Narnia.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheDawnTreader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVoyageOfTheDawnTreader">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></em>: <strong>Greed</strong> — the dragon storyline, and the excessive riches each island offers.
<ul><li> Actually, all seven deadly sins appeared in that book. There were even seven swords in the film that represented conquering them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em>: <strong>Pride</strong> since the main characters assume they can stand alone. Rabadash also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">makes an ass of himself.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverChair">The Silver Chair</a></em>: <strong>Sloth</strong> since Jill constantly forgets the signs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagiciansNephew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagiciansNephew">The Magician's Nephew</a></em>: <strong>Wrath</strong> since Uncle Andrew and Jadis are both very heavy-handed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastBattle">The Last Battle</a></em>: <strong>Envy</strong> since Puzzle and Shift, desirous of Aslan's power, try to establish themselves as Aslan returned in order to manipulate the other animals.
<ul><li> Alternatively, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em> has the main characters <strong>envy</strong> the Narnians, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastBattle">The Last Battle</a></em> has Shift think he's better than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Aslan</a>, whom he doesn't believe to exist (<strong>Pride</strong>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHorseAndHisBoy">The Horse and His Boy</a></em> also makes a good case for <strong>Lust</strong> considering the entire plot against Narnia is contingent on Rabadash's lust for Queen Susan.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Four of the Seven Deadly Sins yield bigotry in <em>The Cold Within</em>. The first and second people are consumed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a>, the third by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Envy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Envy">Envy</a>, the fourth and sixth by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">Greed</a>, and the fifth by Wrath.
</li><li> The Redcrosse Knight meets the Seven Deadly Sins in the first book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieQueene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieQueene">The Faerie Queene</a></em>. Their leader is Pride, who is, interestingly, the only one portrayed as a woman, when most personifications make Lust a woman (since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">All Women Are Lustful</a>). Here, people are invited to party in their mansions, only to eventually end up rotting to death in their dungeon. Fortunately, Redcrosse's dwarf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">sidekick</a> warns him in enough time to help him flee.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic personifications</a> of the sins show up in Marlowe's version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DoctorFaustus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DoctorFaustus">Doctor Faustus</a></em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> short story collection <em>Short Trips: Seven Deadly Sins</em> has the Eighth Doctor encounter seven powerful people who devote their lives to one of the sins, and making them experience a story from his past related to the sin.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Klingons</a> are Wrath (specifically, in this case, taking the form of racial hatred between crested and non-crested Klingons, and the violent rage the tensions awake in them). The Romulans are Pride (with a tendency to under-estimate the other races due to their arrogant assumptions), the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> is Lust; the Ferengi are Greed; the Cardassians are Envy (both as a society in general, as their worlds are resource poor and their neighbours have far more, and in the specific case of the protagonist, who feels her commander was promoted above her unfairly); the Pakled are Sloth (the title, <em>Work is Hard</em>, says it all); and the Borg are Gluttony (overconsumption in general, rather than overeating).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a> based the characters in his novel <em>Ghost</em> on this trope.

</li></ul></li><li> Four of the seven deadly sins can be paired with worlds in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em>. The warlike, uptight Barrayarans would be wrath. The Betans with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture">Free-Love Future</a> would be lust. Jacksons Whole, which is ruled by system that resembles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">The Mafia</a> and where <em>anything</em> can be gotten for money, would be avarice.

They would be pride.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelFlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelFlynn">Michael Flynn</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpiralArm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpiralArm">In the Lion's Mouth</a></em>, Donovan observes that a smuggler's library is designed to cater to at least five of the seven deadly sins.
</li><li> In <em>The Last Cato</em>, the main characters have to solve the mystery of the loss of several pieces of wood belonging to the Holy Cross, and to fulfill this they must pass several trials related to the seven sins, using <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em> as the guide to do it (Dante being a member of the secret society behind it all). Each of the sins takes place in an important city from Roman times that also symbolizes the sin:
<ul><li> <strong>Pride</strong> requires to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire">Greek Fire</a> to activate a mechanism in Roma's Cloaca Maxima.
</li><li> <strong>Envy</strong> consists of running through a labyrinth near Ravenna and then solve a musical riddle based on Pythagoras' "Harmony of the Spheres" theory.
</li><li> <strong>Wrath</strong> requires to solve a riddle in a Jerusalem church using a prayer stone and a clue.
</li><li> <strong>Sloth</strong> requires running from Marathon to a church in Athens in one night (and an answer coming from the previous test).
</li><li> <strong>Greed</strong> is about leaving a room under Fatih Camii (in Istanbul) where the main obstacle is violent winds being expelled from 12 cavities in the wall (corresponding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Aeolus</a>' 12 sons) around Constantine the Great's tomb.
</li><li> <strong>Gluttony</strong> is about exploring a tomb in Alexandria and being as fast as possible in taking off many leeches before they kill you.
</li><li> <strong>Lust</strong> takes place in an Ethiopian town called Antioch, and requires people to get out of a ring of ashes without getting burned before being killed.
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in Rachel Flynn's <em>I Can't Wait!</em>
<div class="indent"> <em>"Jeremy Skinner!</em> Gluttony is one of the seven vices. And idiocy probably is too, Mario Marati. And, Sam Lancer, ignorance ought to be one."
</div></li><li> In Patricia McGerr's <em>Seven Deadly Sisters</em>, each of the viewpoint character's seven aunts corresponds to one sin.
</li><li> In Carolyn Hennesy's Pandora series, Pandora is depicted as a teenage girl who accidentally released the Seven Deadly Sins from her father's box and must hunt down and place them all back into the box. The seven sins are all the same as the traditional ones with the exception of Gluttony, which is replaced by Fear.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters">The Screwtape Letters</a></em>, the devil Screwtape gives his nephew Wormwood advice on how to tempt his "patient" to all of these vices in various ways. However, the concept that these sins are particularly deadlier than any others is implicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">subverted</a>; the devils' main job is simply to keep people complacently unaware of their need for God. Screwtape even specifically cautions Wormwood <em>against</em> getting the patient to commit any spectacularly evil sins, since that could backfire (from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerspectiveFlip">the devils' point of view</a>) by making him more likely to say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a>" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn">repent</a>.
</li><li> Present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent">Divergent</a></em> within each of the factions:
<ul><li> Erudite represent <strong>Greed</strong> in the form of knowledge. There's frequent mention of "Erudite greed" and they eventually seize power from Abnegation.
</li><li> Dauntless represent <strong>Lust</strong> in the form of adrenaline. They will do anything for a rush, regardless of their safety. They're also known to be very physical with each other, whether the others like it or not.
</li><li> Candor represent a different kind of <strong>Wrath</strong>. They're known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a> and no filter, with no thought to other people's feelings. Initiates are also forced to take a painful truth serum when they join.
</li><li> Amity represent <strong>Sloth</strong>. They're pacifists but when people start dying in the other factions, they simply try to stay out of the conflict and ignore it.
</li><li> Abnegation represent <strong>Pride</strong> because they strive to live without sin, which is itself a form of pride. The faction leader is also obsessed with maintaining a respectable public image that covers up his own abusive tendencies.
</li><li> The Factionless represent <strong>Envy</strong>, as they are forced to live on the streets and resent the privileged lives of the others.
</li><li> The Bureau in <em>Allegiant</em> bring out the <strong>Gluttony</strong>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They take children from their families in the fringe, wipe their memories and raise them in the Bureau. And they kill anyone who opposes this, not to mention intending to wipe the memories of an entire city. In this case it's human life itself that is being wasted</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> There are several examples in the villains of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aquitainus Invidia is named after <strong>Envy</strong>, and it's quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>. She is ambitious, amoral, power-hungry, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> started the whole plot going because she was jealous of Isana, who Gaius Septimus married instead of her.</span>
</li><li> Senator Arnos represents <em>Greed</em> (for glory and status).
</li><li> Kord, a steadholder with no real ambitions beyond fulfilling his appetites and who tries to force Isana and Odiana into sexual slavery, is <strong>Lust</strong>.
</li><li> Phyrgiar Navaris, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> mercenary whose iron will is the only thing stopping her from slaughtering everyone around her whenever she's annoyed, is <strong>Wrath</strong>.
</li><li> Kalarus Brencis is <strong>Sloth</strong>, since he doesn't want to make the effort to actually support anything and just wants to live in luxury. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After his province dies and he crosses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>, he can't even be arsed to help <em>save humanity</em>, instead collaborating with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Vord</a> in exchange for material pleasures.</span>
</li><li> Invidia's husband Attis is <strong>Pride</strong>, since he believes he's justified in conspiring against Gaius Sextus because he thinks he'll do a better job.
</li><li> Antillus Raucus (though he's not really much of a villain and only opposes the heroes at first because he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot">Noble Bigot</a>), who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> and still holds a grudge against Gaius Sextus for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureToSaveMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureToSaveMurder">Failure-to-Save Murder</a> of Septimus, is <strong>Wrath</strong>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Vord Queens</a> are <strong>Gluttony</strong>, as they want <em>everything</em> in the world to be for the Vord.
</li></ul></li><li> Even Dr. Seuss wasn't immune to this trope. In the 50th Anniversary edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YertleTheTurtleAndOtherStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YertleTheTurtleAndOtherStories">Yertle the Turtle and Other Stories</a></em>, Seuss scholar Charles D. Cohen pointed out that Yertle and Gertrude each display six of the seven sins. (The seventh, lust, is excluded as these are children's stories.)
<ul><li> Yertle:
<ul><li> Greed: He wants to be a more powerful king.
</li><li> Pride: Every time he expands his kingdom, he boasts about how powerful he is.
</li><li> Sloth: He spends the whole story sitting on his throne.
</li><li> Wrath: Every time Mack complains, no matter how politely, Yertle screams at him.
</li><li> Gluttony: Yertle always wants more turtles for his throne.
</li><li> Envy: He is jealous of <em>the moon</em> for being higher than him.
</li></ul></li><li> Gertrude:
<ul><li> Envy: At the beginning, she is jealous of Lolla's tail.
</li><li> Greed: She decides she absolutely needs a similar tail.
</li><li> Wrath: When Dr. Dake advises against Gertrude getting a new tail, she throws such a huge tantrum that he finally gives in.
</li><li> Gluttony: She eats all the berries.
</li><li> Pride: She is so proud of her new tail that she thinks Lolla will die when she sees it.
</li><li> Sloth: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Her tail makes it hard for her to move.</a>
</li><li> In fact, if the original Latin word <em>luxuria</em> is taken to mean "extravagance" rather than "lust", Gertrude also has that sin: she grows a huge tail with three dozen feathers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AConfederacyOfDunces">A Confederacy of Dunces</a></em>
<ul><li> Ignatius, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">unsurprisingly</a>, manages to embody them.
<ul><li> Ignatius considers himself to be above others in intellect, and refuses to consider the feelings of others.(Pride)
</li><li> Ignatius refuses to do any actual work, spending most of his days loafing around. (Sloth).
</li><li> He is obese, forces Irene to buy him junk food, and steals the hot dogs from the Paradise Vendors stand.
</li><li> He envies Myrna for her intellectual pursuits. (Envy)
</li><li> He constantly chokes the chicken and has very hidden desires for Myrna. (Lust)
</li><li> Even when he earns money, he refuses to give any to Irene to help her pay off her debt. (Greed)
</li><li> He has a mean temper, and often mistreats Irene. (Wrath)
</li></ul></li><li> Other characters in the story embody them too.
<ul><li> Lana Lee squeezes her employees and deals pornography under the table, even posing for some pictures. (Lust and Greed)
</li><li> Mr. Levy doesn't do much by lie around, not taking any interest in his factory. (Sloth)
</li><li> Mrs. Levy constantly belittles her husband and forces her ideals onto others, believing herself to be right. (Pride)
</li><li> Frieda, Betty, and Liz are boisterous and often attack people. (Wrath)

The ultimate conclusion? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">They don't, not really.</a> For animals, traits that seem sinful are valuable survival tactics. For example:
<ul><li> Wrath (referred to as "Anger" in the program): Natural aggression is necessary when animals compete for mates/dominance or, in the case of carnivores, hunt for food.
</li><li> Envy: Some animals will kill others to take things they want (the program depicts a shark embryo eating all of his unborn siblings, an albatross killing his sister and a sea lion killing the offspring of another sea lion to get its mother to mate with him), but for them, it's another case of wanting to survive and pass on genes.
</li><li> Pride/Vanity: Animals that show off are more likely to find themselves a suitable mate, though the program also depicts a downside to this as it makes them more vulnerable to predators as well.
</li><li> Sloth: The conservation of energy is important to any animal, especially when they don't know when their next meal is.
</li><li> Greed: In nature, it's usually a greed for sexual partners, in which case a little avarice helps the gene pool.
</li><li> Gluttony: Animals gorging themselves can seem wasteful, but many times it's just survival or even beneficial to the environment, as with scavengers who clean up corpses.
</li><li> Lust: Sexuality in the natural world is a necessary thing for the species' propegation. No lust, no new generation.

At least, this is how it worked before Ammut was awakened. The five needed sinners corresponded to five different sins, though Gluttony, Lust and Sloth were removed and "Spite" apparently became one of the sins. (Despite it functioning similarly to Wrath). In order, the sinners and their sins are:
<ul><li> Victor: Greed, following how he, well, basically admitted to being it when talking to Frobisher alone.
</li><li> Patricia: Wrath, having screamed at Eddie in hatred when he supposedly cheated on her.
</li><li> Eric: Envy, being jealous of Victor and Denby working without him.
</li><li> Fabian: Pride, after claiming to "proud of being gullible".
</li><li> Alfie: Spite, for trying to attack Team Evil after they threatened Willow.

Beyond his pathological need for stimulation, he also develops a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush">Villainous Crush</a> on Caitlin (lust). He refrains from going after Barry himself, instead sending his press-ganged metahuman followers after him (sloth). He steals Jay's Garrick's identity just so he could have his role as a beloved hero (envy).

He steals the powers of other metahumans for himself (greed) even when he's already strong enough to handle any threat (gluttony). As he gets more powerful, he responds to every slight or show of resistance with slaughter (wrath). He demonstrates a constant need to show off how smart he's become to everyone else (lust). Finally, he resents the fact that he's one of the few metahumans to suffer unintended side effects from their powers, and he specifically tells Barry that <em>he</em> wants to be the one who "saves" the world instead of him (envy).

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raul</span> (Envy) has an obsessive desire for Sofia, wanting her only for him as his jealousy and resentment towards Javier proves that. That leads to almost all of the dramas in the high school being the hacker and even in his family. His interest towards Sofia is behind all of his evil plans.
</li><li> Natalia (Greed) wants to be popular and stay popular. For this, she stole the money of the school from their account in order to buy herself expensive items. Her greedy and selfish nature leads to losing her best friend Isabela and arguing with her twin sister who stay with her despite her secret being revealed. This and her need of money leads to her dealing drugs, a dangerous and criminal activity.
</li><li> Pablo (Lust) is very sexually active and even sex-obsessed despite having a girlfriend. Consequently he cheats on her with Maria but continues their relationship. Later he sends naked photos of himself to Maria and called her "Bunny". It's clear he considers her as a sexual object. And when he discovers he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">got her pregnant</span> a few minutes before tried to get with Isabela again in despair.
</li><li> Less emphasized but Isabela (Pride) was seen by all students as the queen of school. Being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> made her arrogant, snobbish and look down upon the unpopular students as Sofia. Once her secret is revealed however she's lost her status.
</li><li> Maria (Sloth) is generally quiet about her sister's attitude, playing more her sidekick. Also with Pablo her best friend's boyfriend, she didn't really try to stop their affair. She lacks the will to stand up more against Natalia and Pablo, who are more dominant. She's shown to be reluctant/lazy to say the truth to Isabela. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This leads to her pregnancy because she slept continuously with a guy who doesn't want to put on a condom.</span>

<ul><li> In the Flogging Molly song "Seven Deadly Sins", the sins are personified as pirates tempting people to sail away with them and be free.
<ul><li> The lyrics are kind of confusing about the whole personification thing; while Greed (referred to as "Avarice"), Envy, Sloth, Wrath (referred to as "Anger") and Lust are described in a way that makes it clear that they're personified, Gluttony and Pride sound more like vague warnings ("Don't fill your mouth with Gluttony/For Pride will surely swell"). We're also given a little background with the previously mentioned sins; Avarice is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>, Envy is a set of (implicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">incestuous</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">Creepy Twins</a> who are referred to as "idiots" and try to give advice to Sloth (who is indifferent to them), and Anger is implied to have had a relationship with Lust, which apparently ended on a sour note (Anger is stated to tell "bitter tales of Lust").

<ul><li> Dustin Runnels (fka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">Goldust</a>) was hired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a> in 1999 to play a character called "Seven", apparently an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> that would punish wrestlers based on their sins. However, after his father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DustyRhodes">Dusty Rhodes</a> was fired after 20 years with the company, Runnels <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">crapped all over the gimmick in his debut</a>, killing the gimmick. Fortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Standards &amp; Practices</a> had already complained about a promo where he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">standing outside a child's window</a> (but not doing anything) and were worried that he would be mistaken for a child molester, so they probably would've had the gimmick killed anyways.
<ul><li> Part of the confusion came because of how the gimmick resembled the title character of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Powder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Powder">Powder</a></em>, whose director, Victor Salva, <strong>had</strong> been convicted of child molestation in 1988.

<ul><li> All characters have one of the Seven Deadlies as a Vice. By fulfilling their Vice, the character can gratify their ego and gain a point of Willpower, a vital resource. (A character with Greed as a Vice, for example, can fulfill it by screwing someone over for a quick buck.) However, acts that fulfill Vices are usually going to damage the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>, so the player has to weigh the cost against the gain.

<ul><li> The Chaos Gods fit the Deadly Sins very well, although since there are only four of them, you'll have to assign some Gods with more than one Sin.
<ul><li> Khorne: Wrath and Envy (obviously)
</li><li> Nurgle: Sloth and Despair
</li><li> Slaanesh: Lust and Gluttony (specifically the excessive consumption aspect). Slaanesh is also said to live in a palace designed in circles, where each circle tests its visitor in one of the deadly sins.
</li><li> Tzeentch: Greed (for knowledge and power) and Pride (technically he's hope, but envy and pride are essentially the dark sides of hope)
</li></ul></li><li> Thinking about it, all of the major factions of <em>Warhammer 40000</em> fit as the Deadly Sins:
<ul><li> The Imperium: Sloth. The Imperium has spent 10,000 years in stagnation, throwing millions of lives away to appease a deity who may or may not be already dead, with very little technological or social innovation.
</li><li> The Eldar: Lust. They gave birth to the sex god Slaanesh through their own hedonism.
</li><li> The Orks: Wrath. They want to wage war against everyone in the galaxy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">just because it's fun</a>. If there's no other enemy to brutalise, they'll swiftly turn on each other.
</li><li> The forces of Chaos: Greed. Most of their followers turn to Chaos simply to acquire more and more power for themselves. They'll even betray and kill their peers to do so.
</li><li> The Tyranids: Gluttony. Devouring everyone and everything in their path to feed an insatiable hunger is their main motivation and characteristic.
</li><li> The Necrons: Envy. The reason they're the way they are now is because they envied the Old Ones and their immortality, and forged an alliance with the C'tan to become robotic entities.
</li><li> The Tau: Pride. They believe their philosophy is the best and it will save the galaxy from itself, and if you don't think so, they will <em>shoot, bombard and brainwash you until you do</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Slaanesh-themed Book of Excess in the 40k RPG <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlackCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BlackCrusade">Black Crusade</a> includes a short adventure where the players must prove themselves to a Slaanesh-worshipping Chaos champion by beating the practitioners of the Six Arts of Slaanesh (ie. the Deadly Sins minus Wrath, since that is obviously Khorne's territory) at their own game, like gambling against the practitioner of Greed or winning an eating contest against the practitioner of Gluttony. Except for Sloth, where the players have to resist falling into slothfulness rather than trying to out-sloth the practitioner (probably because "roll to see who can do nothing the best" wouldn't really work).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>: The seven sins feature quite prominently in several areas of the game's lore:
<ul><li> The empire of Thassillon was divided between seven Runelords, immensely powerful wizards who each embodied one of the sins.
<ul><li> Zutha, the Runelord of Gluttony, was a unique lich who could taste and feel like a living creature, glutted himself on exotic dishes and consumed the souls of his servants; Xanderghul, the Runelord of Pride, had an army of enslaved angels and manipulated his people into worshipping him as a god; Alaznist, the Runelord of Wrath, was a violent, warlike woman with a terrible temper; and so on. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">master villain</a> of the first published adventure path, Karzoug the Claimer, is the reawakened Runelord of Greed, who wants all the world for himself.
</li><li> Originally, the Sins were known as the Seven Virtues of Rule and focused on their positive aspects, but were eventually corrupted as the Runelords gained power and influence over their own emperor. The Seven Virtues of Rule, and what they were corrupted into, were Wealth (Greed), Fertility (Lust), Honest Pride (Boastful Pride), Abundance (Gluttony), Eager Striving (Envy), Righteous Anger (Wrath), and Well-Deserved Rest (Sloth).
</li><li> The game takes it further by associating each sin with one particular school of magic (the eighth school, Divination, is handwaved as having always been ignored by the Runelords). For instance, Greed is associated with Transmutation, which allows base materials to be turned into treasure, while Wrath is associated with the aggressive, combat-focused spells of Evocation.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedReRelease">Anniversary Edition</a> even presents rules for being a Thassilonian Specialist, a wizard who follows the same style of magic as the Runelords. The advantage is that their bonus slotted spell can be cast twice before being used up. The disadvantage is that, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> on older editions, not only is the wizard forbidden access to two schools of magic, preventing them from ever casting any spells of those schools, the schools they are barred from are determined by the Sin they choose to follow<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13muaw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13muaw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13muaw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in Pathfinder, specialists can choose which schools they are weak in, and merely suffer penalties to casting those spells, instead of being forbidden from using those spells</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Demons</a> are created from the souls of sinful mortals, and the basic <em>Bestiaries</em> always include a group that represents seven deadly sins. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">Succubi</a> represent Lust, both in the physical sense and as lust for power, knowledge and so on; the soul-devouring nabasus are Gluttony; the hulking but brilliant nalfeshnees embody Greed; the hopelessly pathetic dretches associate with Sloth; the sadistic, violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeatheredFiend">vrocks</a> personify Wrath; the incorporeal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">shadow demons</a>, who possess others to take everything from them, are born of Envy; and the contemptuous, arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople">mariliths</a> are tied to Pride. Seven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonLordsAndArchdevils">Demon Lords</a> also place one of the sins under their areas of concern: Socothbenoth for Pride, Orcus for Wrath, Shax for Envy, Jubilex for Sloth, Areshkegal for Greed, Xoveron for Gluttony, and Nocticula for Lust. Demons are so closely tied to the mortal failings that spawned them that their opposed virtues actively harm them; vrocks, for instance, suffer when forcefully calmed and pacified, succubi are harmed by mortals resisting their temptations, and so on.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/InNomine">In Nomine</a></em> makes a nod to the Seven Deadlies, but not all of them are currently represented among the Demon Princes. The directly named ones are the Princes of Lust (Andrealphus), Gluttony (Haagenti), and Greed (Mammon); an older Prince of Sloth was actually eaten by Gluttony. Fans of the game can and have debated who represents Wrath, Envy, and Pride among Hell's present-day royalty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KitsuneOfFoxesAndFools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KitsuneOfFoxesAndFools">Kitsune: Of Foxes and Fools</a></em>, fools are categorized by which of the seven sins they are guilty of, and the foxes' jobs is to purify them of their sins, through pranks.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a> TCG</em>, the Amorphage archetype monsters' Japanese names are all derived from the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins#Origin_of_the_currently_recognized_Seven_Deadly_Sins">eight evil thoughts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, precursors to the Seven Deadly Sins. Their English names, however, play this straight and are actually named after the Seven Deadly Sins, with Irritum's English name being derived from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath">Goliath</a>.
</li><li> The board game <em>The Others: 7 Sins</em> naturally involves this. The titular Others are seven factions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">formed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">from</a> each sin. Each faction has different effects and abilities thematically tied to each sin (for example, Sloth effects movement speed, whilst Pride targets characters who strike out on their own).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Infernum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Infernum">Infernum</a></em> is set in Hell, and each of the Houses has a thematic connection to one of the Sins. Prior to Sturrach's War and the industrial revolution, there was a system where souls identified with each Sin would go to a particular House, but that's fallen by the wayside now; souls go to whoever's got a strong enough claw to snatch them.

</li><li> Sir William the Black (Lust): Abandoned his fiancée and knightly ways to house a succubus queen, founding a cult dedicated to carnal pleasure (sheep in the brothel anyone?) and letting the succubus transform the hapless citizens of his city into a zombie horde. Locked away in the castle is your second choice of mistress, the very sensual Velvet. You can choose to remain faithful to Rose or claim Velvet as your own.
</li><li> Goldo Golderson (Greed): A gold-hungry dwarf who razed the elven kingdom to steal their treasures and used the survivors of the elven race to mine gold in his own kingdom. Deep in Goldo's collapsing castle are two treasures: A mountain of gold and the last elven women. You can save the elves or the gold before time runs out.
</li><li> Jewel, the Thieving Hero (Envy): Kleptomanic thief, constantly steals things other people want. It doesn't matter what it is or if she can use it; if somebody wants it, it has value and she'll take it. On her defeat, you recover the stolen statue. You can return it to the elves or claim it as part of your fortunes.
</li><li> Kahn the Warrior (Wrath): A massive warrior easily overwhelmed with rage for even the most minor issues. Only Jewel could calm him, and after you kill her, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">well...</a> Meanwhile, your "loyal" subjects in Spree betray you to save their own hides from Kahn's fury; you can decide if you want to let this go or give in to your anger towards them and butcher them all.
</li><li> The Wizard (Pride): A man who dedicated his life to defeating the previous Overlord <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only to be possessed by his foe's spirit</span>. He was responsible for the downfall of the other heroes and attempts to usurp (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">well, reclaim</span>) the player's position as overlord. Sure in his ability to accomplish this, he was defeated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the very pawn he had empowered to achieve his ends</span>. This last one seems a less obvious aesop as the others, until the final battle where he gloats how he personally corrupted each of the original heroes one by one throughout the entire fight; pride comes before the fall.

<ul><li> Pride: Prides are the weakest and most common of the Seven Hells, resembling Grim Reapers. Cerberus the Ice Guardian believes humans are inferior to demons, and dismisses Dante as an unworthy weakling after mistaking him for an ordinary human.
</li><li> Lust: Lusts don't really have anything to do with Lust, being essentially stronger Prides that are coloured red. Nevan the Sorceress of the Abyss has a hideout that resembles a brothel, and attempts to seduce Dante. Her comments hint that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFatherLoveSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFatherLoveSon">she lusted after Dante's father Sparda and now turns her sights on Dante</a>.
</li><li> Envy: Envies are similar to Prides, except that they're slower and more resilient to being knocked around, and they are found inside Leviathan (mentioned below). Doppelganger the Deathvoid is a shape shifting shadow who impersonates others, including Dante.
</li><li> Gluttony: Gluttonies can attack by emitting torrents of sand from their mouths. Leviathan the Evil God-Beast is a gargantuan whale-like creature who swallows Dante whole, so it represents this trope to some extent. However, in-universe it's noted to be associated with envy (as in the real-life traditions) and its interior is filled with envies.
</li><li> Wrath: Wraths carry around gigantic bombs that kill them when detonated and can damage ally and enemy. Beowulf the Lightbeast absolutely hates Sparda and has dedicated his life to destroying him and his family.
</li><li> Sloth: Sloths move slowly but compensate for this by teleporting around. Geryon the Timesteed has the ability to stop or at least slow down time, meaning he doesn't usually have to put any effort in his fights.
</li><li> Greed: Greeds carry around a coffin, never letting go of it, and use it to attack. Agni &amp; Rudra the Firestorm are two sentient swords who want the strongest to wield them.

<ul><li> Haruto Higurashi (Editor of Sloth): Formally a writer for news articles, he was given an order to use a photo of a woman involved with a abusive husband but refused out of a promise to the woman. Unfortunately, his superior altered the article to show the woman's face, and the husband retaliated by murdering her, resulting in Haruto losing his job and decided to commit suicide.
</li><li> Zen Kubota (Farmer of Wrath): After discovering his grandfather and mother are his true parents, Zen's personality took a downward spiral into hatred towards his family, ultimately leading him to assault his grandfather as revenge, but injured his brother's girlfriend in the process, and eventually gets disowned by his family.
</li><li> Minamo Setouchi (Officer of Pride): After witnessing her younger brother commit a robbery, Minamo demanded on why he did it, learning that a group of delinquents forced him to. Later, her brother tricked her into meeting with the delinquents and they proceed to beat her. Instead of fighting back, she held back because her pride as an officer to force violence prevented her.
</li><li> Yuma Mashira (Madam of Gluttony): After her mother's passing, she devoted herself to obeying her father's orders in order to satisfy his desires. She's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> and constantly wants to eat.
</li><li> Ryo Makijime (Artist of Envy): While not the representative of Envy, his mother constantly despised him on how he received fair treatment from people while others chose to hate her. She later snapped from the pressure, nearly suffocating Ryo and murdering a man before she took her own life.
</li><li> Rinko Susukino (Florist of Lust): After suffering from endless bullying, she was forced to use her sexuality to beg teachers to make the bullies stop.
</li><li> Mamoru Ichiyo (Doctor of Greed): <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Following the death of his sister, Mamoru searched for a way to clone her back to life with her memories intact, while using the others to his advantage.</span>

As the Demiurge charged with building both Heaven and Hell, you had to construct zones for each of the seven vices (Avarice, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath, Pride, Lust, and Sloth) or their corresponding virtues (Charity, Contentment, Temperance, Peacefulness, Humility, Chastity, and Diligence), most with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Punny Names</a> and entering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">Ironic Hell</a>.

</li><li> <em>7 Sins</em>. The entire game is about this. You play a Ladies' man/porn star/criminal (well, you get 7 different jobs actually) and you have to build up your reputation and become successful, and you do so by committing sins.
<ul><li> Here's a breakdown of how each sin is represented:
<ul><li> <strong>Envy</strong>: The first chapter has the player working as a clerk in a department store (SUKS) to earn money, while being presided over by his overweight, lecherous, and greedy boss who quite obviously doesn't deserve his wealth. In the final chapter, "The Dream" the player is confronted with various nightmare figures who force him into a series of mini-games related to 6 of the 7 sins. In Envy, the player has to steal expensive paintings from his former boss. Throughout the game, the player can steal money from various places, adding to the sin meter for both Envy and Greed.
</li><li> <strong>Pride</strong>: In Chapter 2, the player signs a deal for a reality TV show called "French Kiss" in which he seduces and sleeps with various B-grade celebrities. In "The Dream", the player has to face off against a former rockstar by proving how popular he is. In gameplay, the player must reduce their Stress meter by committing acts of Pride such as encouraging himself in the mirror, or bragging about his wealth to other people.
</li><li> <strong>Lust</strong>: In Chapter 3, the player infiltrates a Masquerade Fetish Club in order to unmask various prominent figures and subsequently blackmail them. In "The Dream", the player must photograph various women, then sleep with them. In-game, the player has a Lust meter that fills whenever the player interacts with attractive women (or men). The player can empty this meter through various acts of Lust such as groping, ogling, or just getting down to some good, clean fun.
</li><li> <strong>Wrath</strong>: Chapter 4 has the player attempting to join a Martial Arts club to protect himself from people who are angry at his newfound success. In "The Dream", the player must battle 7 martial artists. Along with the Lust and Stress meters is the Wrath meter, which fills whenever the player interacts with someone who is particularly irritating. If filled, the player will attack the nearest NPC before fleeing the building. To sate your wrathful impulses, the player can commit smaller acts of violence such as peeing on insects, or shouting abuse at passersby.
</li><li> <strong>Gluttony</strong>: The 5th chapter has the player managing a restaurant on the night that the head chef has invited all of his worst enemies. The player must seduce several of the guests with the aid of various drugs supplied by the chef. In "The Dream", the player must eat a tray of dessert pastries and chug a gallon of beer before throwing up on the chef. In-game, acts of gluttony slightly reduce all 3 of the meters by stuffing himself from vending machines or binge-drinking.
</li><li> <strong>Greed</strong>: In Chapter 6, the player is now the head of Trust Corp and must seduce both a female banker (to secure a billion dollar loan), and the head of another company (to convince her to sign a merger agreement). In "The Dream", the player must negotiate with his employees in order to cancel their Christmas bonuses. In-game acts of Greed provide extra cash by stealing from lockers and safes, and/or pickpocketing.
</li><li> <strong>Sloth</strong>: Does not have a level or a dream challenge, although it could be argued that the whole game embodies this sin, as the main character forgoes hard work in favour of seducing people to do the work for him. In-game, the player can take naps to slightly reduce each of the 3 meters.

<ul><li> Luxuria (Lust) - Asmodeus/Suguru Kamoshida, an abusive volleyball coach <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and implied rapist</span> who uses his position to try and force a student of his, Ann Takamaki, to sleep with him.
</li><li> Irritum (Vanity) - Azazel/Ichiryuusai Madarame, a con-man who has spent decades passing off his pupils' work off his own to pretend to be a famous painter.
</li><li> Gula (Gluttony) - Baal/Junya Kaneshiro, an overweight mafia boss obsessed with blackmailing others to accumulate more and more money, despite having no plans for it other than to have more. The fact that he's content to overindulge and doesn't share Kunikazu's ambition (see below) causes him to qualify for this trope, rather than Greed.
</li><li> Ira (Wrath) - The Sphinx/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cognitive Wakaba Isshiki</span>, the representation of a teenage girl's self-hatred over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">surviving a car accident where her mother was hit and killed in front of her.</span>

He's spent his life bounced around foster homes and crafted the image of the detective prince in the hopes to get people to like him more and draw them closer. However, instead he's put on a pedestal and isolated further. The first true bonds he makes is with the protagonist and the rest of the Thieves and even then, he tries to kill them because they stand in his way of his goal and because of the envy he feels toward Joker. It's to the point where despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">Wild Card</a> like the protagonist, he only has two personas, his natural one Loki and Robin Hood, which is implied to have been born from the bond with the protagonist, whom he hates yet also implies relates heavily with and view as a close friend. As such, he could also be associated with Despair of the 8th Sin.</span>

<ul><li> Lust - The Shibuya Jail, ruled by Alice Hiiragi, a popular fashion designer. Durring her time as a high school student at Shujin, she was bullied by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse">Girl Posse</a> for having a crush on the wrong guy. Once she learned that she could brainwash people with the EMMA app, she not only boosted the popularity of her brand, but she also started humiliating everyone who reminded her of her trauma in the same way her bullies humiliated her, particularly by forcing married men into making public confessions to her.
</li><li> Greed - The Sendai Jail, ruled by the writer Ango Natsume. Although his grandfather was a famous writer, he himself has inherrited none of his skill. When his ego was broken after overhearing his publishers admitting that they're only helping him because they want to sell books writen by "the grandson of Sougo Natsume", he used the EMMA app to pass off a book full of plagarized word salad as a masterpiece, reaping the fame and profits from it in order to hide the pitiful man he actually is.
</li><li> Gluttony - The Sapporo Jail, ruled by Mariko Hyodo, the mayor of Sapporo. After an accident with a snow sculpture caused the death of a little girl, she learned that the accident happened because a government worker hired a faulty contractor for a kickback bribe, and the corruption managed to escape her oversight. Fearful of both her mistake being found out and that someone corrupt would take her place, she used the EMMA app to brainwash her voters to keep herself in power, as well as overwork her civil wards in order make Sapporo a "pure white" city. Like the original, the overindulgence part of gluttony is focused on more than the overeating part (although her Shadow is symbolically obesse from "gorging" off of ballots).
</li><li> Sloth - The Okinawa Jail, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> whose King died before the Phantom Thieves arrived. The jail was used as a testing ground for the Jail system, and the King was driven insane and committed suicide. However, the Jail, and all it's brainwashed insane prisoners, still remain.</span>
</li><li> Wrath - The Kyoto Jail, ruled by Akane Hasegawa, Zenkichi's daughter and Phantom Thieves fangirl. Frustrated over the fact that the police, especially her father, can't detain the criminal responsible for her mother's death by vehicular hit-and-run, Akane grew to despise the police, to the point where she wants the Phantom Thieves to dismantle the police. Her anger only gets worse once she learns that the Thieves have actually been cooperating with her dad, causing her to denounce them as criminals and fakes.
</li><li> Pride - The Osaka Jail, ruled by Akira Konoe, CEO of the successful Madicce Corporation. Due to an incident in his childhood, he's deluded himself into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who believes that he is alone is the hero of justice, and that the only way to fight evil is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a>, causing him to stoop to wild extremes in order to punish those he sees as evil.
</li><li> Envy - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Jail of the Abyss, overlaid over the bottom half of Tokyo and guarded by Kuon Ichinose, creator of the EMMA app. Ichinose has an inability to experience and understand emotions like normal people. The only emotion she seems to be able to experience is self-loathing over her inability to connect with others due to her lack of emotions. In order to understand the heart, she tried to use her knowledge of Artifical Intelligence to create and A.I. with a heart, hoping that by making a being with a heart, then she'll be able to understand what the heart is. However, when said A.I., Sophia, asked her about what the heart is, she percieved this as a failure and scrapped Sophie and create EMMA in a desperate attempt to convince herself that the heart is unnecesary.</span>
</li><li> Melancholy - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Tree of Life and Wisdom, overlaid over the top half of Tokyo Tower, where the EMMA A.I.'s servers and physical form reside. Created by Kuon in order to determine what humans desire, EMMA was loaned out to Madicce for mass distribution, in order to find the answer to human happiness by learning about what humans desire based on what they consult EMMA about. However, as it was programed without empathy in mind, it decided that the answer is to remove all human desire, causing it to evolve into an artificial god and begin gathering the desires of every EMMA user enmasse.</span>

A fat demon who takes over Octagonia and turns it into a casino where monsters can indulge their base desires and is quite fond turning humans, particularly females, into his slaves.

</li><li> Pride <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">keeps screaming about himself</a> and spawns troll bombs. Super Pride spawns Big Troll Bombs. Unlike Wrath, Pride won't hurt itself with its bombs.
</li><li> Sloth is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">lazy recolor</a> of another enemy in the game.

</li><li> Stage 2 — Lucre (Greed): A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> where the enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanditMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanditMook">steal money from you</a>. The boss (Aurum) is a <em>literal</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneySpider">Money Spider</a> that fires jewels at you; it can also turn its shots into indestructible fake money projectiles.
</li><li> Stage 3 — Seduction (Lust): Enemies attempt to latch onto you, or look plain suggestive. The boss (Bio-Cardiac) attacks you with tentacles.
</li><li> Stage 4 — Hunger (Gluttony): Enemies in the area try to "eat" the player via jaws or by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrealisticBlackHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrealisticBlackHole">Unrealistic Black Hole</a>. The boss (Void Warp) attempts to suck the player in as well as the bullets the generators feed it with and "wastes its food" by spitting them back out as harder-to-destroy shots.
</li><li> Stage 5 — Fury (Wrath): Enemies attack with fierce attacks and flames. The boss (Crabburn) attacks the player with an arsenal of destructive weaponry as well as destroying the city itself.
</li><li> Stage 6 — Spite (Envy): You face off against your evil clone who is very jealous of you. He attacks with mainly green bullets and also uses your weapon, but in an offensive manner.
</li><li> Stage 7 — Self (Pride): <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You face off against your prideful leader, Xero-Fin. He uses attacks from the other bosses, referencing the sin of pride being the source of the other six.</span>

</li><li> All seven (and their opposite virtues) appear as personality traits for characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings</a></em>. In the sequel, they are even labelled with the usual numbers, and the descriptions contain the Latin names for each. A character with the corresponding virtue usually dislikes all characters with that sin. Of the seven, five have both positive and negative aspects, while the other two are wholly negative and thus hugely undesirable for a player character:
<ul><li> 1. Lustful: Understandably, a large bonus to fertility (chance of producing additional children). Also a small bonus to the Intrigue stat (which reflects skill at subterfuge). On the flip side, lustful characters suffer an opinion penalty with all members of the Christian clergy and take a hit to their Piety (the "currency" for religious activities).
</li><li> 2. Gluttonous: A hit to the Stewardship stat (which reflects skill at administration). Gluttonous characters are disliked by all clergy and are found much more unattractive by prospective romantic partners.
</li><li> 3. Greedy: A small hit to the Diplomacy stat (which reflects skill at... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">diplomacy</a>). But also grants a whopping <em>10%</em> bonus to national tax income.
</li><li> 4. Slothful: A small hit to every stat across the board, also a small opinion penalty with every vassal. Probably the worst sin for a character to have in gameplay terms. (Its counterpart, Diligent, is probably the best virtue for a character to have.)
</li><li> 5. Wroth: A substantial boost to the Martial stat (which reflects skill at warfare) but a corresponding small hit to Diplomacy and Stewardship. Good for war-oriented players, not so much for others.
</li><li> 6. Envious: A small hit to the Diplomacy stat but a boost to the Intrigue stat. Also a penalty to relations with this character's Liege, for obvious reasons.
</li><li> 7. Proud: The most neutral of the sins in gameplay terms, with only a small boost to Prestige (the "currency" for political activities).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>, each of the 2-2 jobs represents a sin.

Almost all of them die at the hands of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">own sin</a>.
<ul><li> Wrath is represented by Zhi, a Buddhist monk who's gone berserk after he believes the universe has made him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlayThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlayThing">Cosmic Play Thing</a>. After going through so much, he gets so angry that he commits suicide.
</li><li> Greed is represented by Albert, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor">Mad Doctor</a> who is rounding up living humans and harvesting their organs to sell for huge profits. He dies after getting a dosage of his own drug and kills himself by mistake.
</li><li> Sloth is represented by Teddy, a man who's been locked up for days in his mansion while waiting on a pizza guy. He's oblivious to the zombie outbreak, and is never fought directly due to the fact that he's too lazy to deal with Nick personally, instead attacking Nick with remote-controlled weaponized toy helicopters. He dies of a heart attack as soon as Nick confronts him.
</li><li> Pride is represented by Jherii, a bodybuilder who has a high self-value of herself. She gets crushed by her trophy shelf.
</li><li> Lust is represented by Dylan, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">Depraved Bisexual</a> who's holding innocent people hostage in the basement of a porno shop. He dies from inhaling the fumes from his flamethrower.
</li><li> Envy is represented by Kenny, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasementDweller">Basement-Dweller</a> who's jealous about Nick's reputation as a hero. His fight is a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a>, as his jealousy turns him into a copycat. He's the only one who can be spared. If Nick chooses not to save him, he gets killed by the zombies he had unleashed in his efforts to copy Nick's zombie-slaying.
</li><li> Gluttony is represented by Darlene, a morbidly obese woman who won an eating contest years ago. She's now hiding in a buffet and hoarding its food all to herself. She kills those who try to take any food. She dies after slipping and choking on her own vomit.
</li><li> Fans of <em>Dead Rising 3</em> have noticed that the hidden tertiary boss of the game represented the eight deadly sin, despair. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Red has twice given up on the illegals, was quick to abandon the illegals when the plane was ready and he explained that he betrayed them because he wanted to have a reward for his work within the illegals instead of constant misfortune.</span>

Each of the August Celestials represents a virtue that opposes it.
<ul><li> The Sha of Anger is roughly equivalent to Wrath, and those affected by it are stirred into conflict. It and its companion Sha, Violence and Hate, are opposed by Xuen, who represents Strength<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note156tzk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note156tzk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note156tzk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Of will, rather than physical strength</span>
</li><li> The Sha of Violence is similar to the Sha of Anger, and also tied in to Wrath.
</li><li> The Sha of Despair is equivalent to Sloth, as when you go into the Krasarang Wilds, you find some Pandaren in it thrall, who have given up and done nothing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Surprisingly enough, it's also tied to Envy, as in the August Celestials daily questline, you gain a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rival</a> in Elia Ravenmane, who becomes so obsessed with surpassing you that she becomes possessed by the Sha of Despair</span>. As might be expected, it is opposed by Chi-ji, who represents Hope.
</li><li> The Sha of Doubt has no direct correlation with any of the sins here, as those affected with it question their own beliefs. Near the beginning of the expansion, it's spawned from an Alliance fighter who sees his side commit a war crime, and from a Horde general who's horrified at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">what Garrosh will do to him for losing his flagship</a>. It is opposed by Yu'lon, who represents Wisdom.
</li><li> The Sha of Hate is similar to the Sha of Anger in its equivalency to Wrath, possessing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Taran Zhu, who loathes the Alliance and Horde for bringing their conflict into Pandaria (being a race war based on long-standing grudges, it stirs up the Sha), as well as Suna Silentstrike, who goes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> after the Yaungol kill her husband</span>. It is opposed by Niuzao, who represents fortitude.
</li><li> The Sha of Fear also has no equivalent sin, but those possessed by it are either struck with crippling fear or paranoia.
</li><li> Sha of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pride, last and the most powerful, deadly Sha. Not even the good Emperor could purge himself of pride when the world broke. Obviously, this is the Sha that ends up being a final boss in Mists of Pandaria.</span>

<ul><li> There are also 7 items in the game that represent each of the sins, which can be farmed from Act III, where Azmodan is the main antagonist. They are Burst of Wrath (An axe which restores mana when used to kill enemies or break objects), Envious Blade (a knife which guarantees a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> against enemies with full health), Pride's Fall (a helmet that gives bonuses if you don't take damage for a few seconds), Avarice Band (A ring which increases your item pickup radius), Boots of Disregard (which increase life regeneration when standing still, representing Sloth), Insatiable Belt (increases the health gained from health globes and represents Gluttony), and Overwhelming Desire (an amulet which grants a chance of bestowing the charmed debuff on enemies, representing Lust).

</li><li> Wrath is represented by the Ark of the Covenant, a gun that sucks out your enemies' souls and fires them back as explosives.
</li><li> Gluttony is represented by the Last Supper, a gun that coats your enemies in sugary pink goo that causes other enemies to attack them.
</li><li> Lust is represented by the Boom Chicka, a shotgun that causes opponents to follow your around while doing a sexy walk.

</li><li> The fifth boss, the Ringmaster, has shades of bloodlust, greed, and wrath in his desire to feed Spar to monsters simply because he's not making the circus any money.
</li><li> The sixth boss, Shupkay, is envious of other nations of the world for their fertile land and great wealth, while she ekes out an existence as a mercenary.
</li><li> The seventh boss is Aruhmael, a lazy creature who causes other creatures he infects to forget their memories.
</li><li> The eighth is the massively prideful Father Mason, whose exalted behavior as the leader of the Church of St. Eva causes him to stand against the party.
</li><li> Both Gluttony and Despair are set up as bosses. The Queen of Tunlan is an obese selfish woman turning into a demon, but the party defeats the monsters inside of her to stop her transformation. The end boss of Evrai, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> your father</span> is broken in despair and begs for you to kill him, but you can spare his life to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>.

The major sin of each of the seven girls is based on one of the Seven Deadly Sins.
<ul><li> Greed is represented by Kisaragi, a vain girl who is only interested in expensive brand-name objects. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In life, she herself wasn't incredibly wealthy and got bullied for it.

</li><li> Pride is represented by Alice, a meek girl with psychic powers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her parents, upon discovering her psychic powers, hyped up her powers and made her do things that she actually wasn't capable of doing to the point where they formed their own church dedicated to her. Alice realized how wrong it was but kept up the facade because she loved the attention her parents gave her, especially when they started calling her "special".</span>
</li><li> Gluttony is represented by Tomoe, a girl who likes to playfully tease others. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her teasing wasn't always very playful.

<ul><li> Yuuki Terumi embodies all seven of them, as part of him being the Satanic Archetype.
<ul><li> Pride: Terumi thinks highly of himself and himself alone, looks down on everyone else, and tries to shove his message (that despair is the only truth) down everyone's throats, whether they like it or not.
</li><li> Wrath: Terumi has flown into homicidal rage numerous times, particularly when he's inconvenienced. Terumi is more than willing to engage in not only physical harm, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">mental</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">emotional</a> harm, and for a little as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">pettiness</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">out of impulse</a>.
</li><li> Sloth: Terumi's one truth is despair—to forfeit any attempts at improving upon the world—or even oneself. Not only does he embrace it but tries to shove it down people's throats. His ultimate goal is to create a world where people kill each other without him lifting a finger for his own amusement.
</li><li> Envy: Terumi not only actively ruins the lives of others and people's good fortune, he exacerbates people's misfortunes.
</li><li> Lust: Terumi is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">sadist</a> to the T, constantly enjoying harming people and never letting go.
</li><li> Gluttony: While Terumi needs at least only one person to hate him to make him exist, he wants to torment <em>everyone</em> so he can feast off their rage and hatred at him.
</li><li> Greed: Any money that Terumi doesn't spend on personal care, Intelligence Division budgeting, or as donations to Relius, instead either are hoarded or pointlessly wasted away.
</li></ul></li><li> Thinking about it, several of the characters outside of Terumi fit as the Deadly Sins, which also serve as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">fatal flaws</a> that Terumi takes advantage of:
<ul><li> Jin Kisaragi: Pride. His arrogant and self-centered attitude and disdain towards virtually everyone leaves him blind to working with others as a team.
</li><li> Ragna the Bloodgedge: Wrath. Ragna is driven by rage at the whole world at large, killing countless NOL personnel and subsequently leaving a large bounty on him. Even when he's not under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>, Ragna is easy to anger, and in some outcomes, Ragna's rage makes him lose control of his Azure Grimoire, turning him into the Black Beast.
</li><li> Kokonoe: Sloth. Kokonoe refuses to work with anyone, despite being seen as a great asset to use against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadTriumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadTriumvirate">Big Bad Triumvirate</a>, as she would rather coop up in her lab and dedicate her time to trying to get revenge on Terumi by herself alone.
</li><li> Tsubaki Yayoi: Envy. Tsubaki has displayed possessive behavior towards Jin, and intensely jealous behavior towards anyone who's with him. Naturally, this leaves her easy to manipulate, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in several timelines, such as <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>, this has lead to her demise</span>.
</li><li> Nu-13: Lust. Ragna is always the first and <em>only</em> thing that pops up into her mind, and she thinks obsessively of him. Much of the dialogue between her and Ragna is filled with sexually-charged double-entendres.
</li><li> Arakune: Gluttony. Arakune is driven to consume everything as part of trying to obtain the Azure.
</li><li> Nine the Phantom: Greed. Nine is willing to do anything for her sister Celica, even if it means having to bring forth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a> and her sister doesn't agree with her methods.

</li><li> Gormott (Gluttony) is a relatively peaceful and pleasant land, but its abundance of resources and bountiful harvests make it a prime target for the imperialist nations to colonize. The consul in charge, Dughall, is Ardainian, not Gormotti, but nevertheless has been using his position to live a lavish lifestyle if his portly build and opulent livingspace are any indication.
</li><li> Uraya (Envy) holds perpetually-tense relations with its rival nation Mor Ardain and also has designs on Gormott; if the Ardanian emperor's statements are indicative of the past, diplomacy with Uraya often involves placating them with things they want that other nations have. On an intranational level, it is the nation with the most severe social stratification and tension between the haves and have-nots.

Their land is dying (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurtleIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurtleIsland">literally</a>), but rather than swallow their pride and ask other nations for assistance, they've bolstered their military and have taken land by force; Gormott is already under their control at the start of the game, and a war of conquest could break out between Mor Ardain and Uraya at any time. The Ardainian character who joins your party is herself an incredibly prideful person, albeit not in a self-sabotaging or antagonistic way.

</li><li> Little is known about the original nation of Torna (Wrath) as it was destroyed 500 years ago, but in the present day a small band of terrorists have taken the name onto themselves and spend the bulk of their time wreaking havoc upon the other nations.

It seems like a subversion at first, but is eventually revealed to be built on a past of very aggressive conquest. Ancient Tornans carved a bloody path through the world with their military might and their Titan being a dragon with the strongest weapons of any Titan, until a later king grew tired of all the bloodshed and worked hard to rebuild his land into the peaceful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wutai">Wutai</a> society it appears as in the present.

Of the various nations on the continent of Babel, seven of them are named after the sins (Envylia, Wratharis, Slothstein, Lustburg, Gluttony Foss, Greed Dike, and Northern Pride). Each has a Sacred Stone tied to it as well, a source of incredible power but often carrying a curse of some kind; the various names for these stones are shared with demons tied to the (in order of above, Leviathan, Satna (anagram of Satan), Belphegor, Asmodeus, Beelzebub, Mammon, and Lucifer). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Stones themselves were created from giant monstrosities of old called the Cursed Beasts, though it's implied that only their power is in the stones and that their bodies may be buried. The Beasts share names with the stones they became, and have animal forms related to the sins: Belphegor is a bear-like creature, Asmodeus is a goat with many faces, Beelezebub is a giant pig, an a preview image of Leviathan shows a massive serpent-like figure. Given the Cursed Beast statues used to level up characters past the initial level cap, Satna will be a unicorn, Mammon a fox, and Lucifer a griffon).</span>
<ul><li> In addition to the stones and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Beasts</span>, the film introduced Dark Phantoms, altered versions of several dead characters with the animals tied to the sins on their chest and red and black color schemes. Oddly, in the initial batch, only five sins were covered, and by six characters - Pride on Dark Zain, Wrath on Dark Chloe, Envy on Dark Setsuna, Greed on Dark Othima, and Sloth shared by twins from the distant past Dark Nyx and Dark Mira. In the film, these were corruptions of the Phantoms summoned by the protagonists. Each is of the elemental typing strong against to their counterpart and has a unique job based on the "iconic" job of the character they copy.

</li></ul></li><li> In addition, several other entries on this page pop up in collaboration events - the Seven Deadly Sins of Lyoness from the anime and several of the Homunculi from Full Metal Alchemist have both appeared. In addition, the game frequently collaborates with the owner's other title, Phantom of the Kill, and a set of seven "Black Killer Princesses" from that game explicitly tie into the sins theming by fusing a character with demonic essence from one of the demon lords. This is especially interesting since the demon lords share the same names (though different looks) with the Sacred Stones for the same sins. The collaboration characters are "canon" inasmuch as they had a story, but are never mentioned outside of the collab for legal reasons (one character was introduced and died as a living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McGuffin">McGuffin</a> and love interest to one of the main protagonists in the FMA crossover, and still exists and remembers that shared love, but in her own event she makes no mention of who she fought). In addition, Dark Artemis,Black Killer Princess of Lust, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">set up shop in Lustburg despite never being given her own story event in game (just an extra hard level for her weapon)</a> and appears in another event; this is still a crossover, however, and her presence as protector of Lustburg is never explored further.

<ul><li> <strong>Lust (SpongeBob)</strong>: SpongeBob's lust is for love and admiration, not sex. He strongly desires to be liked by everyone (notice how he pesters Squidward, who hates him, and aims to please his greedy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanBoss">Mean Boss</a> Mr. Krabs) and at least two episodes ("As Seen on TV" and "Model Sponge") show how he craves fame.
</li><li> <strong>Sloth (Patrick)</strong>: Patrick is unemployed and extremely lazy, to the point where he won an award for doing "nothing" longer than anyone else in "Big Pink Loser".
</li><li> <strong>Wrath (Squidward)</strong>: Squidward is almost always in a bad mood, hates everyone and everything and has a very short fuse, frequently losing his temper.
</li><li> <strong>Greed (Mr. Krabs)</strong>: The most obvious example on the list, Krabs is obsessed with obtaining money and doesn't want to spend any of it. He underpays his employees, feeds his customers rotten food rather than waste money, almost tore a man's arm off for a penny, sold SpongeBob's soul for 62 cents and once dug up a corpse that was buried in a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not</span> valuable hat, to name a few.
</li><li> <strong>Envy (Plankton)</strong>: Plankton envies Mr. Krabs' success, to the point where he dedicates his entire life to stealing the Krabby Patty formula and putting Krabs out of business. He is literally green with it.
</li><li> <strong>Pride (Sandy)</strong>: Sandy is a stereotypical Texan that is extremely proud of her homeland and accomplishments oftentimes to the point of arrogance, as shown in "Pressure" (where she is hellbent on proving that she is superior to her sea friends) and "Sandy, SpongeBob and the Worm" (where she ignores SpongeBob's warnings that the titular worm is too tough for her).
</li><li> <strong>Gluttony (Gary)</strong>: The least obvious one, since Patrick is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> in addition to his laziness. Gary is almost always eating when he appears onscreen. SpongeBob mentions having to feed him frequently, he eats an entire bag of snail food in seconds in "Procrastination", he eats the fungus off people in "Fungus Among Us", runs away from home in "Have You Seen This Snail?" because SpongeBob forgot to feed him and pigs out when found by a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">snail-eating</span> Grandma, and becomes obsessed with Snail Bites in "Treats!"
</li></ul></li><li> Eddy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Greed: Eddy's character definding trait. Eddy's main goal in life to make as much money as he can and will do anything to accomplish that. This even results in putting the other kid's and his own best friend's lives in danger and often will choose money over them.
</li><li> Wrath: Eddy is one of the most hot-blooded characters in the series and is quick to get revenge on anyone that crosses him. In one episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Kevin</a> accidentally ruined one of Eddy's scams and Eddy spent the entire episode trying to get revenge on Kevin.
</li><li> Sloth: Eddy is the one that comes up with the scams and after he does, he usually sits back and watches while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Double D</a> comes with the blueprints and Ed uses his strength to help construct them. Even in one episode, one of Eddy's fantasies is owning a bank of jawbreakers while kids bring their jawbreakers to him without him having to lift a finger.
</li><li> Envy: Eddy is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> and can't stand others being better or more successful than him. This was shown in different episodes where Eddy is jealous of Kevin's overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">success and popularity with the other kids</a>, Jimmy making more successful scams than him, and even his best friend Ed getting all of the attention as a mascot for their school.
</li><li> Pride: Eddy is very proud of being the leader of the Eds and the brains behind the scams leading to his massive ego. In one episode, Ed wanted to come up with a scam for once but Eddy quickly shot him down not wanting his own friend to make up the next scam.
</li><li> Gluttony: Though Eddy doesn't have much of an appetite or a big stomach as his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Ed</a>, the main source of his Greed comes from his obsession over jawbreakers. All of the scams in the series leads to him earning money to buy jawbreakers with. It helps that the jawbreakers of the series are massive in size and Eddy (and others) have shown to easily fit them in their mouths.
</li><li> Lust: Eddy doesn't show it much but there are episodes where he constantly tries to flirt with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeMagnet">Nazz</a>. There was even an episode where Eddy was recording a video for his brother to see and lies about Nazz being his girlfriend. He also keeps magazines that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">all but stated to be pornographic</a> under his bed (along with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a> of a <em>box of tissues</em>). In one episode, Ed misplaces the magazines, and the group thinks that they've been swept into a storm drain; when Double D tries to assure Eddy that the water will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingThePoint">wash away the writing of the articles</a>, Eddy shrieks "It's the PICTURES I'm worried about!"
