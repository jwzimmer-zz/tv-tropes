<p>A common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitCom">Sitcom</a> plot where the total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> learns his lesson, turns sweet and benevolent, or at least turns more "refined" — and becomes absolutely intolerable such that his new behavior is rather destructive, making the other characters yearn for the original personality. Eventually the character in question will revert to normal, and the reaction will either be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">relief</a>, or realization that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">he really is worse in his obnoxious form</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A subset of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowersForAlgernonSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowersForAlgernonSyndrome">"Flowers for Algernon" Syndrome</a>.

</p><p>This can also refer to a situation where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> is replaced by a new character, much to the relief of the other characters... at first. It turns out that the replacement is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">either much worse, or is so nice that nobody can stand them</a>. Luckily, the regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> will be reinstated, but nobody will ever mention this again.
</p><p>One example of building an episode around a supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justification</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>. This trope has a <em>very</em> high chance of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> if the vice that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> cured is a genuinely harmful one; what kind of friends would WANT their acquaintance to still be an alcoholic, a bully, an incompetent worker, etc. even if it means less lulz/more irritation for them? Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>, this will rarely get pointed out.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aggretsuko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Aggretsuko">Aggretsuko</a></em> after the CEO hears of Director Ton's abuse of his staff and is pushed to do something about it, Ton starts acting very uncharacteristically nice to everyone, freaking them out and leading to their hiding in the break room. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But he goes right back to old habits after finding out Retsuko was the one who complained.</span>
</li><li> Happens to Maeda in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiKora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiKora">Ai Kora</a></em>, where an experimental love potion gone awry causes him to become shy and prudish instead of his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Lovable Sex Maniac</a> self.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amagami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amagami">Amagami</a> SS</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> Tsukasa goes through a period of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">trying to become the kind, sociable personality she uses as her facade</a>. Her love interest Junichi is first confused, then upset and annoyed, as he tries to figure out what has happened to the bossy, efficient girl he had come to respect and love.

Icihko is initially freaked out and suspicious but comes to accept this new side of Momiji <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until it turns out that being in this form will actually <em>kill</em> her</span> so she turns her back to normal by dumping her into a garbage pile. Tellingly, from this point on she begins actually using Momiji's name instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyYou">calling her the Misfortune God.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>, Black Bull member Gauche gets possessed by an elf. After complaining about his usual self's character flaws, his squadmates Asta, Grey, Gordon, and Henry have this to say: "We want the old Gauche back; so we CAN COMPLAIN TO HIS FACE."
</li><li> In an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump">Dr. Slump</a></em>, an insect crawls into the circuitry of Arale, turning her into a quiet, polite, wistful girl-bot. This freaks everybody out, so when they find out the cause and have her reset to "normal", they throw a party to celebrate.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em>, type A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> Louise drinks a love potion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> as only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Saito</a> try to undo her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> transformation.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/GuardianFairyMichel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/GuardianFairyMichel">Guardian Fairy Michel</a></em>, when Salome is kidnapped, Boogy, Woogy, and Meggi just don't feel motivated without her harping on them at every turn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HappyLesson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HappyLesson">Happy Lesson</a></em>: In one episode, Chitose gets fed up with his "mothers'" shenanigans and kicks them out of his house, but then realizes that he is reverting to his old habits; by the end, he relents and returns the copies of his house keys that he'd confiscated.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDxD">High School Dx D</a></em> side-story, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac">Issei</a> loses his perversion and the Occult Research Club tries to restore him back to his perverted self, partly because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingHarem">the girls</a> want Issei <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">to admire them in a sexual manner</a> and partly because they're so used to Issei's usual perverted self that this his new personality seems weird.
</li><li> When King Dedede becomes nicer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em>, thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>, Escargo<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">(o)</a>n wants him back. Everyone else prefers him this way, however.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina">Love Hina</a></em> manga, after Motoko is humiliatingly defeated by her older sister in combat, she resolves to be more feminine, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meido" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meido">takes over most of the household chores</a>. However, she attacks them with the same zeal and discipline that she put into her swordsmanship training, and soon makes everyone miserable. It takes an emotional breakdown and another fight with her sister (with backup from Keitaro and his cursed sword) to set things right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManStarForce">Mega Man Star Force</a></em>: The "EM meteor" in two episodes of the anime makes Omega-Xis act overly polite and gentlemanly, as well as causing him to make some... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">odd</a> comments initially. Naturally, this drives Geo insane, and makes it a lot harder to actually fight for various reasons... Though this is only part of the hilarity of the two episodes, as <em>every other EM being</em> is affected in different ways. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>; a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Endeavor</a>'s fans grumble that they liked him better when he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> after he tries shaping up and acting more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">All Might</a> (such as offering autographs and genuine words of encouragement) following the latter's retirement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyMonsterSecret">My Monster Secret</a></em>: After Akari snaps off one of her horns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Akane</a> becomes genuinely nice and supportive. Not only does this creep the hell out of the cast, but the personality shift is apparently so <em>wrong</em> on a fundamental level that the universe itself can't even function and the world comes dangerously close to ending.
</li><li> This was a part of the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NanakaSixSeventeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NanakaSixSeventeen">Nanaka 6/17</a>.</em> Nenji wrestled with this dilemma when his nagging anti-social childhood friend Nanaka suffered amnesia. The amnesia regressed her personality to that of a six-year old who, while tiresome and largely dependent on Nenji, was also far more sweet and lovable than her adult self.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, three members of the Straw Hat crew, Usopp, Sanji and Franky, were, with the exception of a few close friends and followers, mostly disliked in their home towns. The latter two are told by the crowds at their departure that they will be missed and to come back soon. The former's pranks and lying routine are shown to be an accepted part of life in his village, to the point that some had taken to using him as an alarm and when he doesn't show up one day people are worried that they were too harsh to him the day prior.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PaniPoniDash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PaniPoniDash">Pani Poni Dash!</a></em>, an alien takes over Himeko at one point. The alien is less annoying to have around, but soon even Becky wants Himeko back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>
<ul><li> In an episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Ranma</a> gets hit on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdentityAmnesia">head</a>, thinks he's really a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">girl</a>, and disavows fighting. Later Akane says, "Change back. I don't care if you are rude and insensitive and inconsiderate. I know I complain all the time, but sweet and innocent just isn't you". And then goes bananas when "Fake Ranma" gently tells her s/he can't just change back, chasing her/him around with a baseball bat, though fortunately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">his real personality is restored after falling into the pond and hitting her/his head again</a>.

Seeing Stevie (whom he declared off-limits) getting bullied prompts Reese to go back to his old ways - first beating up everyone who actually deserves it.
</li><li> Subversion: Malcolm himself had an episode where he bit his tongue and resisted the urge to insult everyone for being idiotic, but everyone liked this new persona, and he often got his way. Unfortunately, Malcolm developed an ulcer in only a few weeks due to his gross superiority complex and his inability to express it.

</li><li> In one of the final episodes of the show, Hyde, following a marijuana induced freak out, cleans himself up, stops doing drugs, exercises, eats healthy, and becomes generally insufferable to all of his friends. Cue a hilarious inversion of your standard drug intervention at the end where they convince him to resume smoking pot.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted when Chandler makes a New Year's Resolution not to be sarcastic. His personality really doesn't change, but he finds that he <em>has</em> to snarkily comment on his friends' various foibles.
</li><li> Played straight with Monica's alcoholic boyfriend Fun Bobby. He's awfully dull when reformed and sober. "There is a reason Fun Bobby is so fun."
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, "Queeg", Holly is replaced by the super-strict emergency backup computer Queeg, leaving the regular cast to beg for good ol' Holly to come back.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em> , Quinn tells Masuka, the Lovable Sex Maniac, that the reason nobody came to his speech on his newly-published work is because of how perverted he is. As a result, Masuka starts dressing nicely and cleans up his act. This freaks out Debra immensely. It's only after they stand up for him in front of Miguel's brother that he eventually returns to his normal self, lampshaded by Debra's triumphant "And he's back!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickVanDykeShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickVanDykeShow">The Dick Van Dyke Show</a></em>:

</li><li> In another episode, Alan fires Mel for finally standing up to him, and Rob convinces Alan to rehire him. At first Rob isn't sure why he's sticking his neck out for Mel, who he's always found irritating. He finally decides that Mel's irritating quality is precisely what makes him good at his job.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken to an extreme <em>and</em> subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow">The Drew Carey Show</a></em> when Lewis has a religious experience and fancies himself a holy man. The thing is that he's as much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> while devout as he is normally, and in fact goes moreso, to the point of decrying official religions as not holy enough and declaring himself a new prophet. When confronted by his friends who he's been berating for their sinful ways, he shouts, "If God doesn't like it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmiteMeOMightySmiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmiteMeOMightySmiter">he can tell me so!</a>" ...whereupon he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">struck by lightning</a>. "Could have been just coincidence!" The next two direct strikes convince him, though, to the point that he breaks down and says "Fine! Fine, I'll smoke, I'll drink, I'll masturbate! If someone will help me, I'll do all three at once!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Titus">Titus</a></em>, Papa Titus decides to give up drinking. Sober, he realizes what a horrible father he's been and spends all his time crying, never leaving the house, he ignores attractive women and almost loses his job as a salesman because he stops having fun with his clients. The other characters hold a <em>reverse</em> intervention to get him to start drinking again, and he does, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">but then gets angry at the things they said and starts playing mindgames to get revenge</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dwight is fired and replaced by Andy, who is just as annoying and doesn't even have Dwight's various eccentricities that made him so much fun to wind up. Jim: "I miss Dwight. Congratulations universe, you win." A bit of a twist as when Dwight returns Andy stays in the office, becoming a little more likable in the process.
</li><li> Another episode has Dwight becoming a nice guy after suffering a concussion. Averted in that the rest of the office doesn't necessarily <em>want</em> "old Dwight" back, so much as that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">they realize his newfound friendliness is a manifestation of a serious condition that needs medical attention</a>. Pam even says goodbye to Nice Dwight when she realizes she'll likely never see him again after he gets back from the hospital.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House">House</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted in an episode in which House tricks the other doctors into thinking he has syphilis, which can cause personality changes. The rest of the cast then tries to treat him with penicillin, thinking that the syphilis is what made him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">Dr. Jerk</a> - as if the syphilis itself isn't enough of a reason. He, then, in order to mess around with them, pretends to be nicer, but also purposefully acts like a way more crappy doctor. Cue the chorus.
</li><li> Same thing happens when Foreman recovers from a near death experience and decides to spread sunshine around, since he's grateful to be just alive. House torments him (What's new?) to get him back to his familiar ways, because his doctor skills are not so useful when he's happy.
</li><li> There was also that time House switched to methadone, and while he was happier and pain-free, he ended up convincing himself that his diagnostic skills are seriously compromised as a result of being nice (he agrees to a "pointless MRI" to please the parents because he doesn't feel like being a jerk to them; resulting in the dye almost killing the dehydrated boy who otherwise would have been completely fine), and he's back on Vicodin by the end.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt">Night Court</a></em> performed an extended version of this trope during most of its 8th season and the early part of its 9th season with a subplot where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a> Dan Fielding became a virtuous do-gooder after being placed in charge of a charitable organization. Even after he left the charity job behind, Dan still remained nice, thoughtful and respectful to women... until he was slapped by a woman who had hoped to enjoy the pleasures of the old Dan. The slap awakened the long-repressed lecherous urges of the Old Dan who proceeded to give the woman what she wanted... and then some. <br/><br/>There was also once a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashback</a> scene where it's revealed that Dan (real name Reinhold) was actually a prudish gentleman, until a sophisticated (but slutty) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernBelle">Southern Belle</a> takes his virginity, resulting in his subsequent chicanery.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> when Barney tries to sleep with Robin again: after Lily points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> Ted dated Robin for a year, Barney spent the whole dinner being nice and polite, even ignoring other women. This had the opposite effect, freaking Robin out and she spent half the dinner trying to get him 'act like Barney' again. However, it's averted for the series as a whole. During the course of the show, Barney has become increasingly mature and sensitive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherTed">Father Ted</a></em> - episode New Jack City. Smelly drunk Father Jack develops Hairy Hand Syndrome and is shipped off to an old priests home. His replacement is a terrible bastard which causes Ted and Dougal to mount a rescue mission. With hilarious results!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dinosaurs">Dinosaurs</a></em> - In one episode, Baby Sinclair is named king of the dinosaurs and taken away to 'fulfill his destiny'. While the entire family is noticeably upset, Earl especially has trouble returning to a life without Baby to say "Not da mama!" and hit him with a frying pan. Robbie tries to substitute, but just can't do it right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "McKay and Mrs. Miller", McKay has a alternate reality counterpart show up. The entire cast seems to get along with Rod (even his sister), until he returns to his reality. They invite the original over to their table in the mess hall and tell him the alternate was kinda creepy and he would never be replaced.
<ul><li> And yet Rod admires his jerkish counterpart, pointing out that Rod is a people person and is obsessed with people liking him, while Rodney doesn't care and just speaks what's on his mind.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with later in the episode "Vegas". It is set in an alternate Rodney's universe. Shepard has the same personality, but as a detective his personality causes him problems. Of course, alternate Rodney knows he has potential...

<ul><li> Frasier Crane once got rid of his agent Bebe, an extremely successful but comically amoral <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath">Heroic Comedic Sociopath</a> often compared by the other characters to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a>, in favor of a nice, mellow and family-oriented agent who turned out to be utterly incompetent. In the end, he had to swallow his pride, and his scruples, and ask Bebe to come back and clean up the mess his new agent made of things. She did so with gusto, and he learned better than to ask how (murder and blackmail may or may not have been involved).
</li><li> In the episode "Love Bites Dog", jerkass and intense womanizer Bulldog steals a date that Frasier is on from right under his nose. A few days later, Frasier and Roz find out that Bulldog has fallen in love with this woman. They are both shocked at his changing personality, particularly Roz. However, Bulldog is heartbroken when she dumps him on the phone right before his sports show. Afterwards he cries on the air and leaves the station, resulting in Frasier filling in for him. Feeling out of place, Frasier realizes that he has to revert Bulldog back to his usual self and quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> This is done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Entourage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Entourage">Entourage</a></em> when they fired Ari Gold.
</li><li> Done seriously in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> where after Kate dies Gibbs becomes subdued and not nearly as much of a jerk, freaking out the rest of the team.
<ul><li> Promptly subverted when McGee timidly pipes up that he kinda likes the new Gibbs . . . only to be glared into submission by his teammates.
</li><li> This also happens during his "retirement" phase, when he came back from Mexico with a mustache. Shaving the mustache marked Gibbs' return to normal.
</li><li> And more recently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Tony</a> grows unexpectedly professional for an episode, which gets all the other characters wondering if this is an elaborate prank or if there's something seriously wrong. It's the latter.
</li></ul></li><li> At the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em> episode 424, Joel has installed "protocol modules" in Crow and Tom to make them nicer. While he notes they're easier to deal with, their incessant praise of him leaves him "kind of hollow". He removes the modules just prior to the Invention Exchange, with Tom immediately criticizing Joel's hygiene.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry">Meet the Browns</a></em>: When Mr. Brown got hit on the head his whole personality changed: suits and sweaters instead of loud 70's clothing, courteous and kind, instead of whiny and rude, and (for some reason) speaking in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishAccents">British accent</a>. At first family and friends enjoyed the new Mr. Brown, but when he began to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">brutally honest</a> about their actions and character, they decided that the original Mr. Brown wasn't that bad after all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, whenever Toby Ziegler <em>isn't</em> acting like like the abrasive, self-righteous, pompous and short-tempered jerk he usually is, people get worried fast. Of course, the nature of working in the White House means that the other characters either don't have time or don't have to worry about whether he'll switch back, because something inevitably comes up to ruin his mood anyway.
</li><li> Happens twice to Sally Smedley on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DropTheDeadDonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DropTheDeadDonkey">Drop the Dead Donkey</a></em>. The first time, in Series Two, the conversion is religious after the death of her grandmother, and increases in intensity until she ends up being jerked out of it two or three episodes later by a perverted evangelist (just as George approaches her for spiritual guidance on his marriage breaking down). The other characters attempt to shock her out of it. The second time, later on in the 1990s, she falls pregnant from a one-night-stand, decides to keep the baby, gets broody, and then miscarries, all in the space of two or three episodes. The others decide to be a bit more sympathetic to her this time round, only for her to decide the day after the grief over the miscarriage that she has given up feeling anything whatsoever and is happy to go back to being a cold-hearted slapper.

His friends don't even briefly entertain the thought of keeping this Ron — he terrifies them. When he starts expressing trust for the government, Leslie actually <em>slaps</em> him. (She herself loves the government, but coming from Ron, this is mirror-universe stuff.)
</li><li> Tom loves fancy status-symbol products and always focuses on empty flash over substance, so naturally, he drove his first company into the ground with overspending. He decided to be more serious with his next venture, but ended up taking it way too far, forcing his friends to point out that both him and his new clothing store were no fun at all.

</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeverlyHillsTeens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeverlyHillsTeens">Beverly Hills Teens</a></em> had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> Bianca trying to be nicer to people. Her chauffeur, Wilshire didn't like the change, preferring her old self.

In reality, everyone loves the excitement his over-the-top antics brings to their lives to the point where Really Old Lady starts dying of boredom and doesn't come to until Buddy changes back to his old self.
</li><li> Practically spoken word for word in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBearsUnlockTheMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CareBearsUnlockTheMagic">Care Bears: Unlock the Magic</a></em> episode "Rain Rain Go Away." After his frustrations cause his belly badge powers to go out of control, Grumpy rebrands himself as Mr. Happyface. However, no longer being grumpy means he can't use his belly badge powers at all, even when they're needed to solve the episode's problem. In the end, he gets back in touch with his "inner grump," but still apologizes to the others for taking out his frustration on them earlier.
</li><li> Totally averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em> episode "Dan Vs. Dan". When Dan's response to his identity thief is apparently to give up and reinvent himself as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> Biff, Chris is overjoyed that he has two nice friends instead of one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> friend. Elise thinks the whole thing is an act <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and of course she's right.

Chris falls to his knees weeping over the loss of his two new friends (especially because fake Dan baked him pie).</span>
</li><li> Played mostly straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>: in "Quinn the Brain", when Quinn happens more or less by accident to get a reputation as 'a brain' (while still remaining popular), Daria realizes that this is impinging on <em>her</em> self-image. She proceeds to do a turn-about on Quinn by dressing fashionably and pretending to go out on a date with The Three Js, causing Quinn to ditch the beret and black sweater and go back to the Fashion Club. Later in the series, it's established that Quinn really is intelligent and she finally lets go of her fear of embracing it. By that point, Daria has gotten over enough of her own personal issues to actually be supportive of her.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveTheBarbarian">Dave the Barbarian</a></em>, Dave's little sister Fang, known for being the single most violent, fearsome being in all the land despite being pint sized, undergoes a transformation that makes her much more sedate and ladylike. Dave and his older sister Candy appreciate this greatly for a while, but then the kingdom is threatened by giant bugs. Fang, who the bugs are terrified of and would flee from on sight, refuses to go into battle and instead settles to make clothing for the beetles, as she's been putting clothes on every animal she possibly can. Dave and Candy try to make her snap back to her usual self, but fail until Fang sees both her siblings in danger and promptly goes back to her normal homicidal rage monster self to protect them.
</li><li> While Dee Dee from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> is hardly a jerk, she does annoy Dexter with her ditzy and destructive habits. But even when Dexter manages to get rid of Dee Dee, it doesn't last because Dexter feels that it's not the same. Two major examples being...
<ul><li> "Dexter's Assistant" in which Dexter made Dee Dee much smarter so she would stop fooling around and start helping him with experiments, but she turned out more intelligent and competent than him.
</li><li> "Dee Dee and the Man" in which Dexter "fires" Dee Dee, only to realize that the chaos she causes has been helping him concentrate. Dexter holds auditions to fill the void and ends up hiring an actress in the role of Dee Dee.
</li><li> An inversion happens in "Way of the Dee Dee" when following another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">rant from Dexter about Dee Dee being stupid</a>, Dee Dee, in return, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">pitifully chastises</a> Dexter for spending his youth alone in his laboratory and not knowing how to have fun. Devastated, Dexter pleads his sister to teach him "the way of Dee Dee". She agrees, but the results are catastrophic - the reworked Dexter proves to be even more erratic and destructive than Dee Dee herself ever was. She smacks him back into his right mind.

<ul><li> Not to mention the episode that he quits the Protectorate for a glamorous job in the family restaurant sector.
</li><li> And finally, the episode where the Martian Commander removes Dodgers' brain to study why he's such a "genius", swapping in an artificial brain in the meantime. Dodgers ends up far more competent and heroic with the replacement brain and defeats the Commander easily, retrieving his real brain, with help from the Commander himself getting more than he bargained for when he managed to get into the "intelligence cortex" of Dodgers' brain. At the end of the episode, Cadet realizes that this will just turn Dodgers into a useless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> again, but can only remark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">"It was fun while it lasted..."</a>

Then it turns out they were just playing with him the whole time and hadn't really changed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents">The Fairly Oddparents</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode had Timmy saving Vicky's life, causing them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">become friends</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">hilarity that ensues</a> has Timmy and his fairies wanting Vicky to turn evil again.
</li><li> Even more so in the episode where she was kicked out of B.R.A.T. Timmy then calls her out as not being nice and therefore having no friends. She take it to the heart by becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">Clingy Jealous Girl</a> towards Timmy and forcefully turning him into her girlfriend-replacement. Timmy apparently has no choice but to make Vicky hate him again.
</li><li> Crocker ends up here when a therapist hypnotizes him to not believe in fairies anymore. Because he is needed for the sake of Fairy World's energy crisis, Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda, and Jorgen von Strangle do their best to get him back into his fairy-crazed state.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> It happened to Peter Griffin about a dozen times, e.g. when he stopped being a couch potato, when he stopped being a chauvinist, when he tried to learn how to act sophisticated (though in that one, he just became a very different kind of jerk), etc. It would seem that Lois has never heard the expression <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">Be Careful What You Wish For</a>. Given that when he has an excuse to act like more of a jackass <em>he does</em> (such as in "Petarded", when he finds out people will excuse him anything after he's diagnosed as mentally incompetent).
</li><li> It also happens to Stewie in the episode "Stewie B. Goode", when a near-death experience and a vision of hell scares him into being 'nice'. However, this makes Stewie look like a complete tool until Brian eventually snaps him out of it.
</li></ul></li><li> Long before it happened to Peter, it happened with Fred in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em>. Being hit on the head turned him into a polite, articulate gentleman... Who everyone found even more obnoxious than before. Barney suggested knocking him on the head again to try to turn him back to normal, but neither he, Wilma, or Betty could make themselves do that; but they managed to trick him into doing it to himself.
</li><li> This frequently happened to Bender on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>.
<ul><li> When he found religion in "Hell Is Other Robots", though it had more to do with Bender being obnoxious in entirely other ways (like multi-hour sermons in stuffy, un-air conditioned rooms).
</li><li> In "How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back", Bender's personality is downloaded and sent to the Central Bureaucracy. This reverts Bender to a simple "insert girder, bend girder" mode. When it is noted that Bender is now helpful and polite, everyone decides to get their jerk back. They even lampshade it by not being able to rationalize why they should.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, Professor Farnsworth in "Bendless Love", when Bender bends his spine so he continually faces upwards. This results in his brain being flooded with endorphins, making him obnoxiously cheery. By the end of the episode, Bender is so sick of listening to him he bends him back the other way, instantly making him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger">very sad</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">Everyone is fine with it.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> On an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GarfieldAndFriends">Garfield and Friends</a></em>, Garfield is hit on the head and gets amnesia, becoming a sweet, polite, cat who only eats healthy food and wouldn't dream of kicking Odie off the table. Jon and Odie are worried and take him to the vet. The vet wonders why they want to restore Garfield to normal. By the end of the episode a second hit has him back to normal. Garfield promptly eats everything in sight and kicks Odie off the table. Jon and Odie couldn't be happier.
<ul><li> Also happens in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres">U.S. Acres</a></em> segment. Orson has is tired of Roy's insults and has him fired. So Wade invokes this trope by hiring his annoying cousin Fred to replace Roy. After a few minutes of his insults Orson is yelling to get Roy back.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex">Generator Rex</a></em> episode "Robo Bobo" deals with the second version of the trope: Bobo decides to take a break and puts a robotic duplicate in his place, which unlike the original, is considerate and rule-abiding. Rex, having grown used to Bobo (and annoyed by how much of a goody-two-shoes his double is), slowly reprograms the robot to be more like the real ape. In the end, it ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">learning too well</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>:
<ul><li> "Big Bob's Crisis", with Big Bob Pataki.
</li><li> In another episode this happens to Miriam when Bob injures his back and she takes over the Beeper Emporium. Bob stays on the couch glued to the soap operas while Miriam ends up staying late at the Emporium every night, too busy to pay Helga any attention.
</li><li> In "Helga's Show," the comedic imitations Helga performs showcasing her friends' idiosyncrasies cause them to shun her. Taking Phoebe's advice, she tries a kinder approach to her humor, which falls flat. Ironically, it's Arnold who suggests that she go back to the edgier material she used before, which works.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HiHiPuffyAmiYumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HiHiPuffyAmiYumi">Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi</a></em> uses this trope in the short "Bad Manager" in which the girls have their jerky manager Kaz lose a bet and wind up with a new manager who treats them quite well and provides them with all manner of luxury. In the end they discover Kaz, down on his luck and they decide to try and get him back because he's "family".

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotelTransylvaniaTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HotelTransylvaniaTheSeries">Hotel Transylvania: The Series</a></em> used this plot in the episode "Fried Mean Tomatoes", where Mavis makes a wager with Aunt Lydia that Quasimodo can handle a cooking class, but finds herself in danger of losing the bet because of Quasimodo being rude and tactless to his chosen class. Mavis has Tiffany help her make Quasimodo nice by removing his mean streak, but has to restore it when it turns out that the mean streak has taken control of Wendy Blob and that Quasimodo will die if he doesn't have his meanness restored.

Sarah and her parents quickly get annoyed by Percy's overbearing and strict ways and try to get Ralph to slip back to his bad habits when they see that his time at Mr. Fred's Finishing School has brainwashed him into monotonously chanting "I am a good cat".

</li><li> In "Timmy 2000", all the boys take Ritalin and become dull and attentive. Mr. Garrison misses their crude behavior and Chef helps them return to normal with help from an "antidote" drug named "Ritalout".
</li><li> Averted when Cartman's goateed "evil" mirror self showed up, who, being the "evil" version of Cartman, was extremely nice and thoughtful; Stan and Kyle like him so much better than Cartman that they actively try to send their universe's Cartman back to the mirror universe instead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it didn't work</span>.
</li><li> In "South Park Is Gay" the women of South Park are at first pleased to see how neat and presentable their husbands become after catching the latest metrosexual fad, but soon the effimancy, vanity and general uselessness of males starts grating on their nerves and they are forced to take the only appropriate action in such situation: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murder the cast of the gay show that started the fad.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This has happened a number of times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants">Spongebob Squarepants</a></em> with numerous characters, sometimes as a whole episode plot and sometimes as a single sub-portion of the overarching story. A few examples are when Squidward was electrocuted by his own electric fence and developed a personality very similar to that of SpongeBob (at the end he was returned to normal by another electrocution, which also struck SpongeBob and Patrick, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">turning them both into Squidward personality clones</a>), a time when SpongeBob tried to become "normal" and lost everything unique about his personality, and when Patrick's brain was accidentally replaced with brain coral after an accident, turning him into an arrogant super-genius who does not understand the concept of fun and is too smart even to be liked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> Sandy. That one ends up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowersForAlgernonSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowersForAlgernonSyndrome">"Flowers for Algernon" Syndrome</a>, with Patrick using his newfound genius to mathematically determine his actual brain's location in the brain coral fields where he lost it so he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">become his old self again</a>.
<ul><li> A minor variation also came when Squidward, after yet another disastrous run-in with SpongeBob and a door, recovers to find himself suddenly quite handsome. He enjoys the new attention it brings him, only to then find his admirers refuse to ever let him alone. He ends up begging SpongeBob to bash him with the door again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em>: In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS3E17DoubleAgentDroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarWarsRebelsS3E17DoubleAgentDroid">"Double Agent Droid"</a>, Chopper, the obnoxious astromech droid, is remote-hacked by an Imperial specialist who plays him as being much nicer than usual. After Chopper is restored to normal, the crew is forced to admit they prefer Chopper as an obnoxious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em>:
<ul><li> An episode had this happen to resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> Raphael, when he accidentally blasted himself with a "Personality Alterator" ray, set to "Very Nice". His friends were happy at first, until they discovered that he was so nice he'd even help the criminals they were trying to capture. The episode's villain also used the ray to make the city's police and guards similarly docile and captures the Turtles with no effort. The Turtles finally get Raphael back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> by setting the ray to "Very Nasty" and getting him to shoot himself with it.
</li><li> That wasn't the first time it was used either. In an earlier episode Leonardo decides that everyone needs to train harder. The other turtles get tired of working so much and use the Personality Alterator to make Leonardo into a fun loving, laid back guy. He plays annoying pranks on the others, and doesn't care about fighting crime. Not only are they sick of him but they need the old Leonardo to help them beat the villain of the week.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em> had Buster, Plucky and Hamton trying to fix Dizzy Devil by combining their personalities and putting them in him using a machine, it works, the new Dizzy is polite, intelligent and good natured, but it is revealed that the old Dizzy was very popular with girls and said girls are rather unhappy with the new Dizzy.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> short, Tom is hit over the head with a broom and thinks he is a mouse. He immediately becomes totally harmless and takes a highly annoying liking to Jerry, who cannot stand this and spends the whole episode trying to turn Tom back into his arch-enemy.
</li><li> In the episode "Changing Gears" of the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> cartoon, the Decepticons remove a critical component they need for their Weapon Of The Week from the Autobot Gears, changing him from his usual grumpy, complaining self into being a lot nicer. The other Autobots react negatively to this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Ironhide:</strong> What did you do to Gears, you monster?! You turned him... nice!
</div><ul><li> <em>Nearly</em> inverted at the end of the episode, before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Optimus Prime replaces the component anyway, and Gears begins grumbling again only to be left behind by the other Autobots</span>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Trailbreaker:</strong> Well, we took a vote and... we decided we like Gears the way he is now.
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWeekenders">The Weekenders</a></em> episode "Sense and Sensitivity", Lor's friends finally get fed up with her jerkish behavior. She spends the rest of the episode going out of her way to be kind and thoughtful, which drives her friends crazy and makes them wish for the old Lor back. And the catalyst that starts all this? Lor losing a basketball game by being a ball-hog. They're worried that she might start passing the ball... <em>to the other team</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Jack Spicer</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em> briefly has all the evil removed from his body: however, the Xiaolin Dragons find his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">overbearingly good</a> personality even more annoying than the failed attempts at evil.
