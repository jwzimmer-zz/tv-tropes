<div class="indent">— <strong>Frank Herbert</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em>
</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>One mark that distinguishes humans from nonhumans is that humans have funeral rites; they regard something as due to the dead and have for a long time. Indeed, since burials leave archeological evidence, we know that they occurred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">as many as 300,000 years</a> ago, as a practice among the Neanderthals.
</p><p>Unsurprisingly, this has been incorporated in art as a trope, as a mark of character, and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>, with funeral rites in art from ancient civilizations. <strong>Evil</strong> characters will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishonoredDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishonoredDead">violate proper treatment</a> of a corpse by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesecratingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesecratingTheDead">mutilating</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">reanimating</a>, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eating the dead</a>, though Due To The Dead is one of the most common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">standards villains maintain</a>. <strong>Good</strong> characters will (rarely!) do the same to a dead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a> or the like, but usually are marked by their proper respect for the dead, down to even letting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a> end when the villain is dead; if they have to destroy bodies to contain a plague, or display it to prove that he is really dead, they will often find it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">Dirty Business</a>.

</p><p>A wide variety of practices are possible, as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Cremation and burial are the most common, but such practices as exposing to the dead to vultures and other unusual methods can be done in fiction as in life. Even slicing up the body  usually regarded as mutilation and proof of evil  has been done in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> as a means to free the soul from the body and has featured so in fiction. In a simmilar vein of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, even the above-mentioned eating of the dead has been a common funeral rite done in real life as a means to allow the dead to live on in their loved ones. Still other cultures have even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Zig-Zagged</a> this trope, regarding the <em>corpse itself</em> as an irrelevant lump of flesh now that it no longer houses a spirit, regardless of whatever rites they may or may not perform to commemorate the spirit that left it. Preserving parts (usually bones) of the dead can be the mark of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancer</a> or of respect, depending on how used; see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope">Sub-Trope</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay">Dead Guy on Display</a>.

</p><p>Note that some dead are due more than others. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> calls for a well-attended funeral, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">Famed in Story</a>, and perhaps even a monument. Sometimes to mitigate the effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone">Dying Alone</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatYouAreInTheDark">What You Are in the Dark</a> may threaten that the hero will die unmourned. Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishonoredDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishonoredDead">some are due less than most</a>; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a>, etc. may be dumped in an unmarked grave with minimal ceremony.
</p><p>On the other hand, some of the living owe the dead more than others. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">Family</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">friends</a> have a duty to carry this out, often through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrineToTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrineToTheFallen">Shrine to the Fallen</a>. Strangers who perform such things for the dead are acting out of generosity; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodShepherd">Good Shepherd</a> may perform such rites. Indeed, some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">ghosts</a> manifest in order to properly reward a total stranger who arranged for the burial.
</p><p>Other ways in which this trope might present itself: closing the eyes of someone who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiesWideOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiesWideOpen">Dies Wide Open</a>; sorting through the deceased's belongings (may result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalEffectsReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalEffectsReveal">Personal Effects Reveal</a>); responding with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">Manly Tears</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenderTears">Tender Tears</a>; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulFuneral">Meaningful Funeral</a>, when most characters show due respect; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyFuneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyFuneral">Lonely Funeral</a>, when few; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LibationForTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LibationForTheDead">Libation for the Dead</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatsOffToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HatsOffToTheDead">Hats Off to the Dead</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyJunior">Dead Guy Junior</a>; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChainBeyondTheGrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChainBeyondTheGrave">continuing to bind postmortem</a>; a determination to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword">carry on the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingUpTheMantle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingUpTheMantle">deceased character's work</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastRequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastRequest">Last Request</a>; people wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePoppy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePoppy">The Poppy</a>; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSpeakIllOfTheDead">Never Speak Ill of the Dead</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Avenging the dead</a> is also common, though it's viewed as less "good" than the other options.
</p><p>However, no matter how beloved the dead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">Excessive Mourning</a> may be decried. Ghosts may complain that it is keeping them from peace, or characters may be criticized for neglecting their duties to the living.

It's eventually revealed that the reason for Gauron's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">obsession</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a> towards Sōsuke stems from having seen the dignified way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Sôsuke</a> serenely dragged and threw the corpses of all his fallen enemies into a makeshift burial. There was no compassion or great emotion found in Sōsuke's eyes while he was doing that, and his reason for doing it was presumably because of his own internal set of morals.
</li><li> As for Gauron himself, he reveals that when he was around the same age as Sōsuke, he was ordered to arrange the bodies of the victims of the Khmer Rouge his Pol Pot colleagues killed. The similarities in that aspect end there, however. Although he was forced to give proper burials to the people his superiors killed, he is shown to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">sick and perverse</a>, and is later shown to have wanted Kaname's body to be raped and brutally violated by the assassin he sent after her (along with photos to be taken of it). Of course, his reason for that might be based more on his want for revenge against the girl that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">melting the heart</a> of his "beautiful" Assassin Saint.

<ul><li> In the Appendices, Tolkien recounts the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, which broke out after orcs killed Thrór, heir of Durin and desecrated his body. After the final battle of that war, the dwarves had to cremate their dead, being too numerous to bury them in the traditional stone tombs, and earth burials being unacceptable. As a consequence, to say of one's ancestor that "He was a burned dwarf" came to be a boast that he had fought and died in this battle.
</li><li> It's made very clear that in the eyes of Men, Orcs do <em>not</em> merit Due To The Dead: at one point the characters encounter a battlefield where the victorious Rohirrim have piled the vanquished Orcs' bodies up and burned them, leaving an Orc's severed head on a spike. (It's interesting to compare this to Tolkien's depiction of the siege at Minas Tirith, where the bombarding of the fortress with severed <em>human</em> heads is portrayed in very emotive terms as a particularly horrifying and barbaric act.)
<ul><li> And Orcs don't practise Due To The Dead either; as well as the example cited above, one reason why Saruman fails to beguile Théoden in the chapter "The Voice of Saruman" is that the King is irate about the mistreatment of doorwarden Hama's corpse in the Helm's Deep battle.

Cordelia's relative silence is interesting, given that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>she</em> was the one who told Bothari that, in a very different context—to help him recover after he'd saved her life by killing his sadistic commander.</span> This exchange also opened with Cordelia telling Miles that he could dig the hole in a few seconds with a plasma arc, something that Aral had told her when they dug the grave for her dead crewman, on the day they met.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a>: City of the Dead</em>, Necropolis and its people were cursed long ago and told that something terrible would befall them if they did not respect their dead. Consequently they bury bodies instead of incinerating them, and insist on burying anyone who dies on Necropolis, tombstone included. They have elaborate traditions built around these things, even though most half believe at best. A villain takes advantage of these traditions to make zombies; he's killed fighting the protagonists, and his assistant dies mysteriously.

The soil on the farming deck isn't deep enough for a proper burial, and he worries that the goats will dig it up and drag it around. He ends up burying it as deep as he can, and placing bent springs and broken glass around the body to keep the livestock away. Later, another character shows considerable disrespect to a dead body by punching it in the face.

The hero Tavi realizes there is nothing to morn, for they died doing their duty and their sacrifices will save thousands if not millions of lives.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> franchise shows many different funerary customs for the various races.
<ul><li> Spock's funeral has his body <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurialInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurialInSpace">shot out of the torpedo tube</a>, in a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurialAtSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurialAtSea">Burial at Sea</a>. The full context (both in the movie itself and over the entire franchise), and especially what happens in the following movie indicate that this is <em>not</em> the traditional Vulcan burial rite. Starfleet has been around long enough to build up its own customs and traditions about burial while serving.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudMerchantRace">Ferengi</a> dice up and sell the bodies of their dead as a souvenir. From the perspective of a society motivated primarily by the acquisition of profit and the belief that absolutely everything worth having has monetary value, <em>not</em> selling off the deceased's body would be an admission that the person literally had no worth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Klingons</a> will hold open the eyes of a dying warrior and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWail">howl at the moment of death</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHerald">as a warning to the afterlife</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">a Klingon warrior is about to arrive</a>. After keeping watch over the body for a night (to protect it from predators), once the spirit has had time to make the trip to Sto-vo-kor, they then just dump the body, believing it to be an empty shell, but will celebrate the honorable dead with feasting, drinking and singing. The episode "The Sound of Her Voice" explicitly likened the celebrations to an Irish Wake.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> touched on Klingon death customs a couple times. First, a Klingon can engage in an act of glory to "pay the way" for one who would not otherwise be worthy of Sto-vo-kor (Worf did this for his late wife Jadzia<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3oqwa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3oqwa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3oqwa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">by successfully destroying a sizable Jem'hadar base</span>; she normally wouldn't be worthy because she was a Trill who was not killed in honorable battle, but blindsided by Dukat). A later episode featured Kor, an old Klingon warrior who wanted to find a way to avoid dying in dotage; he manages to do so by taking Worf's place in a suicide mission. His sacrifice clears the way for a convoy of Klingons to escape. So Martok (who <em>hated</em> Kor in life) begrudgingly gives him due: opening a bottle of bloodwine and issuing a toast to "a noble warrior to the end".
</li><li> On the other hand, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> introduces a Klingon house that gives their dead a proper funeral, which ends with the coffin being placed on the hull of their flagship.
</li></ul></li><li> The Romulan commander in "Balance of Terror" orders the dead Centurion's body dumped into space along with a bunch of debris to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingPossum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingPossum">make it seem that his ship has been destroyed</a> — but he is clearly distressed about it, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToTheDead">asks his late friend to forgive him</a>.
</li><li> In "The Next Phase" Ensign Ro, who is presumed dead after a transporter malfunction (but is just rendered invisible and intangible), worries that Picard will hold a Bajoran funeral, which includes a funeral chant that goes on for two hours.
<ul><li> In the same episode, Data takes on the task of arranging a memorial for Ro and Geordi La Forge (who is in the same situation as Ro for the same reason), and ends up with something resembling a party more than a traditional funeral. Apparently aware of his deviation from tradition, he briefly asks Dr. Crusher if he's made a mistake, but she tells him it's just fine. (For their part, Ro is a little taken aback, but Geordi thinks it's great.)
</li></ul></li><li> The DS9 episode "Ties of Blood and Water" doesn't touch much on traditional Bajoran funeral practices, but still demonstrates the essence of the trope. When Kira's father dies, she immediately begins to dig his grave. The episode ends with the death of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> of hers (a Cardassian ironically enough), and reveals that she has buried him next to her father, under the same tree.
</li><li> In "Unnatural Selection", the crew of the <em>Lantree</em> are infected with a rapid aging disease that kills everyone aboard. To keep the disease from spreading, a quarantine transmitter was initiated to play a recorded message for anyone else finding the ship to stay out. When it was concluded that retrieving the bodies for burial would only cause the disease to spread further, the <em>Lantree</em> was destroyed by a photon torpedo fired by the <em>Enterprise</em>, but not without Picard requesting everyone to stand in quiet respect for the deceased.

</li><li> In "Emanations", the crew discover a cobweb-filled cave filled with bodies, and Chakotay insists they avoid disturbing the bodies even with scans as it may violate the beliefs of whatever alien race left them — he cites how how he once removed a rock as a souvenir on an away mission, only to find it was a sacred stone placed in commemoration of the deceased. Turns out he disturbed the bodies anyway, as the cobwebs were created by their decomposition. Then Harry Kim finds himself on the planet where the bodies came from, and they complain about him <em>not</em> running any scans, as it could have told them what happens after death (they'd assumed that on dying their bodies entered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream">The Lifestream</a> instead).

In certain areas, it's also possible to encounter a person's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">other ghost</a>, who will also likely be pissed off if they didn't receive a proper funeral.
<ul><li> The reason non-hungry ghosts value funerals being that even the most basic rites allow one to "live" like a king in the Underworld (paper and wooden effigies carry over as luxurious and possibly magical treasures, food items become never ending, sacrificed animals will be loyal and virtually indestructible sources of food, fur and labour and so on).
</li><li> The grand funerals given by the Dragon-Blooded to appease the ghosts of the Solars after the Usurpation actually saved the Underworld, if not all of Creation. All of the death and destruction associated with the Usurpation caused the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Neverborn</a> to rise from beneath the Underworld with their spectre armies, but since the Solars had their panoplies from life as grave goods, they were able to drive the invasion back.

Creon, the new ruler of Thebes, has declared that Eteocles will be honored and Polyneices disgraced. The rebel brother's body will not be sanctified by holy rites, and will lie unburied on the battlefield, prey for carrion animals like worms and vultures, the harshest punishment at the time. Antigone and Ismene are the sisters of the dead Polyneices. In the opening of the play, Antigone brings Ismene outside the palace gates late at night for a secret meeting: Antigone wants to bury Polyneices' body, in defiance of Creon's edict. Ismene refuses to help her, fearing the death penalty, but she is unable to dissuade Antigone from going to bury her brother herself. Tragedy ensues.

<ul><li> Humans, city elves, and presumably surface dwarves burn their dead. Spirits occasionally cross the Veil and possess corpses (or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">maleficar</a> can summon them to do the same). Cremation is thus the primary way to prevent this. Dalish elves, meanwhile, bury the body and plant a tree over the remains; Alistair calls this "life springing from death."

The Priests of Arkay oversee all funerary and burial rights, which include bestowing Arkay's Blessing and Law. These prevent the soul or body (respectively) of the deceased from being used in necromancy. However, when Mannimarco <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">ascended to godhood</a> as the God of Worms during the Warp in the West event, he became a celestial body that orbits Arkay.

</li><li> Despite Arkay being one of the deities of their official religion, Imperial law was always a bit more flexible, considering the body and soul of a person to be possessions. This allowed them to be sold, traded, or willed away as any other property. Necromancy wasn't even illegal in the Septim Empire, as long as the dead being used was a willing volunteer.

If a Giant dies elsewhere, other Giants will carry the body to one of the burial grounds.
</li><li> This is part of the reason given for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety">Mages Guild</a> putting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanOnMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BanOnMagic">ban on necromancy</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>.

<ul><li> In parts of Iran and the west coast of India near Mumbai, the Parsi Zoroastrians take dead bodies to dakhmas, also known as towers of silence, where the body is left for the vultures to scavenge, because the corpses cannot be buried in the earth, cremated or thrown into water, which would desecrate earth, fire and water which the Parsi Zoroastrians regard as sacred elements.
</li><li> Social animals other than humans, such as elephants, cows, apes, monkeys, magpies, ravens and others have been documented to mourn their dead, or at least to consistently behave in ways very similar to human mourning.
</li><li> It is traditional in Europe and the United States at public gatherings, particularly sports matches, to mark the passing of someone notable in that field or a notable tragedy with a minute's silence or, at times, applause. An adult breaking this silence can lead to anything from evil looks to public vilification to near lynching, with a few very rare exceptions - for instance, the AC Milan fans spontaneously singing 'You'll Never Walk Alone', the club anthem of Liverpool FC, during a minute's silence a matter of days after 96 Liverpool fans were killed at the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_disaster">Hillsborough Stadium disaster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> A fallen boxer is sometimes remembered by what's known as "The Final Ten Count". The announcer states the memorial and cues the timekeeper, who then rings the bell ten times to signify the fighter falling for the last time.
</li><li> Military funeral traditions are about as old as militaries. In the West, various tributes to fallen warriors persist such as the Riderless Horse (for colonels and other important leaders) and the Missing Man Formation (for pilots).
</li><li> After his skeletal remains were rediscovered 530 years after his death, left in a pauper's grave at Greyfriars in Leicester and in modern times forgotten and paved over with a parking lot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Usefulnotes/RichardIII">Richard III</a>'s exhumed remains were reinterred at nearby Leicester Cathedral with the full honors befitting a king of England, including the presence of the Archibishop of Canterbury. Surprisingly, there were still some who saw this as controversial - given that for five centuries Richard III had been vilified as the evilest king in English history (though the Richard III society insists this was Tudor propaganda).
</li><li> After the massacre of forty-nine people at the Orlando nightclub Pulse and the slaying of the mass murderer, the Orange County coroner's office did something unprecedented. When it came time to autopsy the killer, they didn't do it in the building as where his victims lay in wait. The doctors refused to allow the man to in the same building as his victims out of respect for those who were killed.
</li><li> Starting in the mid 2000s with police and moving through the ranks of many other first responder professionals like firefighters and EMTs, there is the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_Watch_Call">End of Watch Call<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

The mission patch for Apollo 12 had an extra star in his memory. Furthermore his replacement, Alan Bean, laid his [Williams'] aviator badge and astronaut pin on the moon.
</li><li> When his close companion Hephaistion died, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander The Great</a> staged a funeral that was estimated to cost the equivalent of $2.5 billion. The funeral pyre alone was seven stories tall and took six months to complete. After the cremation, Alexander also ensured that Hephaistion was counted among the divine heroes and had the sacred flame in the temple of Babylon extinguished, a rite reserved normally only for the king himself.

<ul><li> In horror films, the classic reason why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mummy">mummy</a> stirred was to avenge itself on those who broke into the tomb. Indeed, more generally this trope is a persistent theme in horror films.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Charade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Charade">Charade</a></em> plays this for laughs: Audrey Hepburn is attending the lying-in-state of her husband when three former associates show up, one by one. One begins sneezing violently, causing the widow's best friend to remark that he must've known the dead man very well: he's allergic to him. Another holds a mirror to the corpse's nostrils to check for breathing. And the third slams open the church door, strides in fiercely, and jabs a pin into the dead man's hand.

<ul><li> In the Expanded Universe, Predators without honor are hunted, their bodies dismembered and desecrated, and their heads disposed of, as opposed to being kept as a trophy. It seems that the Predators see keeping a skull as an honor not just for prey but for themselves as well.

What makes this more complex is that Meti had remarked that she wanted her body disposed of this way when she died, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCynic">The Cynic</a> (in the philosophical sense). Hence, her student might have done this as a mark of respect for Meti, though her second student (and only actual apprentice) disagrees heavily on that point.
