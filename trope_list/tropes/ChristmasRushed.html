</div></div><p>Christmas Rushed is the practice of rushing a product's development in order to coincide with a major holiday shopping rush (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCreep">Christmas</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">naturally</a>).

Whatever the case, the fact that the product was rushed often leads to a poorly made product. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithLicensedGames">The Problem with Licensed Games</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a> usually occurs due to this, as the developers are rushed to have the game released at the same time as the licensed property's premiere/launch/kickoff.

Worse are those products that do manage to be released on time, since it's often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">obvious</a> that they're rush jobs.

<ul><li> In this modern age of easily-downloadable bootleg fansubs, many American anime licensees will compete with the pirates by rushing out a quick-and-dirty sub-only streaming version on either their own web site or sites like Hulu or Crunchyroll to give fans an official version to watch while they wait for a full-featured, English-dubbed DVD release or TV showing. Depending on just how much of a rush they're in, the streaming version may include translation errors, typos, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">Adaptation Induced Plot Holes</a> that are corrected in later releases.
</li><li> Each <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime is out when the games they're representing are released, and must end just before the release of the new generation of games. Because of this, we often got situations such as the incredibly rushed finale for the Sinnoh League, where, to prevent Ash from winning, the writers made him fight a trainer who used exclusively legendaries. The saga after was more brisk all around, but it was rushed even further with the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pokémon Black 2 and White 2</a></em>.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> gained a lot of buzz through (bootleg) fansubs, U.S. licensee Bandai made the controversial decision to push out a sub-only DVD release as a stopgap rather than wait for an English dub to be complete and possibly lose business to piracy. They did eventually release a version with a (very well-regarded) English dub some time later.
</li><li> Chapter 182 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> was a rush order before Golden Week of 2018, which didn't give time for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KoheiHorikoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KoheiHorikoshi">Kohei Horikoshi</a> and his assistants to do touch up on the artwork. So when it was released, a few of the panels were still in their sketch phases.
</li><li> The television anime adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em> was a produced with a six month period of development. Typically a series will have a development time of ten or more months. And it showed, to the point that the series eventually got cancelled and the remaining arcs were adapted as OVAs.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> OEL manga <em>Graystripe's Adventure</em> - the first of the manga spin-offs of the series - was originally meant to be a single volume manga called <em>The Lost Warrior</em>. Then somebody at HarperCollins had the idea to release it on the same day as <em>The Sight</em>, the first book in the upcoming new arc. The artist was only a third of the way done, so since he was unable to finish it in that amount of time, it ended up being split into three shorter volumes with the first one being released on that day. Later manga in the series followed suit by splitting the story into three parts as well.

<ul><li> The comic's adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> included Jabba the Hutt, looking much different from his appearance two films later.

The trade paperback redid the panels to make him closer to the Yoda in the film, but he was still clearly too big.
</li></ul></li><li> As the final part to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em> storyline, <em>KnightsEnd</em>, was beginning right before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZeroHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ZeroHour">Zero Hour</a></em>, virtually every <em>Batman</em> title was tossed in to complete the storyline, including the usually-not-in-modern-day <em>Legends of the Dark Knight</em> just so the Bat-titles could be involved in <em>Zero Hour</em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliensVsPredatorRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AliensVsPredatorRequiem">Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem</a></em> was timed to be released in 2007 on Christmas Day, and had an appropriately-themed marketing campaign ("This Christmas, there will be no peace on earth."). In addition, the film was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotScreenedForCritics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotScreenedForCritics">Not Screened for Critics</a>, and debuted to negative reviews and box office apathy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> had expected the film to be released in the Summer of 1978, but a debt-laden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaPictures">Columbia Pictures</a> insisted he have it ready for Christmas 1977. The film was a success, but Spielberg was unhappy with the way it turned out because of its rushed production. He was given the chance to re-edit the film years later.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield">Cloverfield</a></em> had to be rushed into production (which started in August 2007) to be ready in time for its stone-set date of January 18th, 2008 (the trailer, which was released a month earlier, came out while the film was still in pre-production).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986">The Fly (1986)</a></em> had an August 1986 release date locked in by 20th Century Fox; principal photography didn't begin until December 1985. The visual effects team thus had to create makeups, animatronics, etc. within two months rather than the usual six this kind of production would receive. Luckily, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCronenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCronenberg">David Cronenberg</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductionPosse">Production Posse</a> had years of experience working together and the actors and visual effects artists were there because they <strong>really</strong> wanted to be there, so everyone pulled together and pulled it off. The rush may or may not have helped its box office prospects because it was able to take advantage of the wake left by Fox's biggest release for Summer '86, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em>, which appealed to a similar demographic. In any case, <em>The Fly</em> ended up a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleeperHit">Sleeper Hit</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FleischerStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FleischerStudios">Fleischer Studios</a> adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GulliversTravels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GulliversTravels">Gulliver's Travels</a></em> was given less than two years of development, starting May 1938 and with the deadline being Christmas 1939. The result was an enjoyable film that did well at the box office, but it had an obviously rushed, unpolished feel to the animation as a result.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters (1984)</a></em> had an early script treatment by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAykroyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAykroyd">Dan Aykroyd</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IvanReitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IvanReitman">Ivan Reitman</a> saw potential but wanted it more grounded and suggested a massive rewrite. From there he pitched the idea to Columbia Pictures, who really like working with him and gave it the greenlight but set a due date 13 months away without a page of a shooting script. Reitman, Aykroyd and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldRamis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HaroldRamis">Harold Ramis</a> locked themselves in a cabin for two weeks to put together something plausible, but they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">storyboarding and rewriting all through production to make their deadline</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween5TheRevengeOfMichaelMyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halloween5TheRevengeOfMichaelMyers">Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers</a></em> was rushed through quickly to be released in time for Halloween the year after <em>Halloween 4</em>. As a result, shooting started without a completed script, and numerous re-writes, cuts, and changes were made on the fly during production.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AHardDaysNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AHardDaysNight">A Hard Day's Night</a></em>: Rushed to capitalize on what was assumed to be a passing fad. It was filmed quickly and on the cheap, but has aged surprisingly well and is considered a classic in its own right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastActionHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastActionHero">Last Action Hero</a></em> was rushed to open for the 1993 big summer movie season, to the point that post-production on the film was only finished a few weeks before its initial release because early test screenings went <em>much</em> worse than expected, requiring reshoots. To make matters worse Columbia Pictures execs refused to change the release date under any circumstances, even when it became clear that Universal's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> was scheduled to open the weekend before their film, figuring that the latest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArnoldSchwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> movie could easily draw audiences away from it in its second weekend. Instead, <em>Jurassic Park</em> proved too big to dethrone that soon.
</li><li> Mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastStarfighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastStarfighter">The Last Starfighter</a></em>, a movie about an alien race who recruits pilots through video games:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rylan Bursar</strong>: Return the money, Centauri. <br/><strong>Centauri</strong>: Return the money! Are you delirious? Do you know how long it took to invent the games? To merchandise them? To get them in the stores by Christmas?
</div></li><li> The post-production on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The Last Airbender</a></em> was rushed so the film could be converted to 3-D in time to meet an Independence Day weekend release.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeatherfaceTheTexasChainsawMassacreIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeatherfaceTheTexasChainsawMassacreIII">Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III</a></em> began production in August 1989 in order to make a November 3rd release date (trailers shot before the film was were shipped out with that date before prints of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet5TheDreamChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreet5TheDreamChild">A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child</a></em>). Despite finishing production just days before the original date, issues with the MPAA forced a delay to January 1990 and the film flopped due to said delays and the cuts to get an R rating being very obvious.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> rushed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Munich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Munich">Munich</a></em> into production and post-production in just five months so he could open it in time for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">Oscar qualifying</a>. Though the film was a box-office disappointment (due to advertising not being ready until two weeks before opening), it did get some Oscar nominations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsFromSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetsFromSpace">Muppets from Space</a></em> was planned for release in early 2000, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyPictures">Sony Pictures</a> wanted it to be part of their summer 1999 lineup, resulting in this trope.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> films are usually given release dates even before production starts, starting right with the first sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FromRussiaWithLove">From Russia with Love</a></em>, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> lasted only four months (getting behind schedule and over budget) to be completed by the already set October 1963 premiere.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JusticeLeague2017">Justice League</a></em> was originally on track to meet its November 2017 release date, but things fell apart when the studio demanded extensive reshoots after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZackSnyder">Zack Snyder</a>'s departure, in order to alter the film in the wake of the disastrous critical reaction to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a></em>. There was talk of pushing it back to Spring 2018 to accommodate the massive changes made to the film but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> execs demanded that it still be ready by November, which directly led to the many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">instances of dodgy, unfinished-looking CGI</a> that critics and viewers pointed out. The real kicker? Apparently, the reason the movie had to be released by November was so WB execs could get bigger bonuses before the year's end. To compare, the work on the special effects of the unaltered version, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackSnydersJusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZackSnydersJusticeLeague">Zack Snyder's Justice League</a></em>, has a leasurely pace before release as no formal date has been given for its release apart from 2021 (the annoucenement came in May 2020), though it's also due to the VFX people having to work from home because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/COVID19Pandemic">COVID-19 Pandemic</a>.
</li><li> In an inversion, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WonderWoman1984">Wonder Woman 1984</a></em> was going to be rushed to meet a November 2019 release against the creative team's wishes. They wanted more time to polish the project and felt like they might run out of time. When a new studio head came on board, he agreed to give the time they wanted and pushed the movie back seven months to June 2020 (although it was later pushed back again a further four months due to the coronavirus pandemic).
</li><li> Proving that this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision">Older Than Television</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSonOfKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSonOfKong">The Son of Kong</a></em> was put into production immediately after the success of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1933" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong1933">King Kong (1933)</a></em>. Movie sequels were still a new concept at the time and the studio wanted the sequel fast-tracked so the first movie would still fresh in the public's mind, and before competitors could swoop in. <em>Son of Kong</em> was released only nine months after the original, recycled many of the same props as the first film, and is one of the few Hollywood sequels to be released in the same year as its predecessor. Needless to say, <em>Son of Kong</em> is nowhere near as acclaimed as the original film, being considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a> at best.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekTheMotionPicture">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a></em> had an absolutely non-negotiable December 1979 release date, and was still being edited and re-edited up to the very day it was due to premiere. For the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">Director's Edition in 2001</a>, director Robert Wise stated that they were simply completing a movie that had gone unfinished for decades.

Thanks to its smaller budget the film did relatively well at the box office, it was considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyImprovedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurprisinglyImprovedSequel">massive improvement</a> after the lackluster results of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVTheFinalFrontier">Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</a></em>, and rivals <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em> for many fans as their favorite film in the series, proving that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>. The rushed postproduction period may have been the reason the movie was changed slightly for home video. The VHS and laserdisc releases had remade end credits and included some explanatory dialog that was missing from the theatrical release (which wasn't seen again until 2009).
</li><li> Oliver Stone had to rush the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/W" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/W">W.</a></em> (which began development in late 2007 and began filming in April 2008) so he and Lionsgate could have it out before the 2008 election (the original plan was to release it in January 2009 to get more post-production work done but Lionsgate was wanting Oscar nominations so it was moved up).
</li><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">many</a></em> things that went wrong with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>. Even though filming was way behind schedule, the executives wouldn't delay the movie for fear of missing its lucrative December release date. This is at least in part because the accompanying action figures by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Hasbro">Hasbro</a> were due to hit shelves on Black Friday, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">meaning the movie had to come out just a few weeks later</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLittleShopOfHorrors">The Little Shop of Horrors</a></em> has earned recognition for having the shortest production schedule of any major motion picture. Its entire production was squeezed into the last week of December, 1959, with all photography completed within 48 hours. The most likely story for this schedule is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCorman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerCorman">Roger Corman</a> wanted to get one more movie made before a new law on actors' residuals went into effect in the new year.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmallSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SmallSoldiers">Small Soldiers</a></em> is not itself an example, but features an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> case — the primary cause of the entire mess is the (by the designers' statements) incredibly short development window to get a revolutionary toyline on the shelves (three months). The result of that is that the toyline is made from apparent off-the-shelf parts with the designers too busy to look at the actual source (the Department of Defence), based on sloppily combining two toyline concepts with incompatible backstories and with no time for product testing. The actual mechanical functioning of the toys is surprisingly good for all this. Their programming and how it interacts with their chips' learning ability, on the other hand...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla (1998)</a></em> was fast tracked with just a year long production cycle, in part because Roland Emmerich promised the studio he could have it done by the summer of '98. This contributes largely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">his own misfeelings</a> about the movie, thinking they didn't fully develop Godzilla as a character (hero, villain or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">Gaia's Vengeance</a>) and that contributed to its' lackluster reception.
</li><li> The 2019 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cats">Cats</a></em> film adaptation was rushed to be released just before Christmas, which is resulted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">unsatisfactory</a> or downright incomplete visual effects such as Judi Dench's human hand being visible in one shot. This prompted the studio and the director to rerelease the film to correct some of these issues, an unprecedented move for a movie so soon after its initial release.

Wright was frustrated at the decision, presumably gave Waters a hard time about it, and Waters decided to tell the band and management that either Wright would be fired or Waters would leave, taking <em>The Wall</em> with him. As Pink Floyd were in desperate financial straits at the time, were already a little agitated at Richard's behavior and needed a hit album to restore their fortunes, they fulfilled Waters' wishes and let Wright go <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dwgc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0dwgc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dwgc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though Richard stayed as a salaried member of Pink Floyd for the Wall tour, and as a result was the only member to make any money from it, as the other three pitched in their own earnings to finance the elaborate (and expensive) production</span>.

</li><li> It is presumed that this is why Natsume's translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon64">Harvest Moon 64</a></em> was released at the end of November, with so many on-screen typos in the in-game English-language text.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em> had a very tight schedule, and the game was released only 8 months after it's announcement. Even though it re-used the engine, gameplay, props and even a portion of the map from Arkham City, it was very glitchy when it was released. Although it did receive multiple patches, and is generally considered to be a bit better now, it didn't help that the developers outright stated that they would stop patching minor bugs in favor of developing the story DLC.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords</a></em> suffered this fate, with a horrible ending that tied up very few loose ends capping off a game that could have been Legendary Good. LucasArts just <em>needed</em> it to be out by Christmas, and damn the players' satisfaction with the game. Obsidian has stated that they were under the impression that they were to be given more time by Lucas Arts but unfortunately they didn't get it in writing and still had to release the game by the end of 2004 which led to even more rushing, and even with the rush, it didn't reach Europe until February. And the worst part about this example is that LucasArts then specifically told Obsidian they couldn't restore the cut content in a patch. After years of effort in pulling the unused audio and video files and rendering their own gameplay and animation to fill in the gaps, some fan groups have finally created their own mods so that a "complete" game can be played (on the PC version, at least).

Despite that, it wound up on the opposite end of the spectrum and is considered one of the best <em>Sonic</em> games produced.
</li><li> <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. The developers were simply too ambitious for both their time limits and the limitations of the system they were making the game for, so the game had to be split into two, the first part being released on February 2nd, 1994, or "<em>Hedgehog Day</em>", and the second part, <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em>, released eight months later, allowing players to combine the two parts to play the two back-to-back (with a few added features) as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicSpinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicSpinball">Sonic Spinball</a></em> was a holdover until <em>Sonic 3</em> was released. It was completed in six months and had a distinctly unpolished feel to it, but was well-received nonetheless.
</li><li> In Japan, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> was rushed out to meet the high demand and capitalize on the 1998 holiday season. Sonic Team USA then spent an additional year polishing it and fixing various bugs and glitches for its Western release, and this version was also re-released in Japan as "Sonic Adventure International" in October 1999.

As a result, the team couldn't get the game to run smoothly and had to release an earlier, more stable build, which was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">Obvious Beta</a>, widely considered as one of the worst entries in the entire <em>Sonic</em> franchise.
</li><li> The 3DS version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>, which was rushed out in about 6 months or so, compared to the console versions which were in concept since at least 2008. While the final product certainly wasn't a disaster by any stretch, it lacks content compared to the console versions and it's obvious that some corners were cut (including the rival races, which take place on improbable stages).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a>: Rise of Lyric</em>, which suffered, among other things, from underpowered hardware, trouble with CryEngine 3, and limited development time. To say that the game had a turbulent production period is an understatement. It was released mid-November 2014 (reports say it went gold in Mid-July) and since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">it's obvious the game wasn't finished</a>, gamers and fans have already been calling it the next <em>Sonic 2006</em>. It was critically trashed; it currently has the worst Metacritic score for any Sonic game (even trumping the infamous Sonic 2006), and it was a total flop at retail, outsold by Sega's own <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation">Alien: Isolation</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager">Football Manager</a> 2015</em>, and not even breaking into the top 40 sales chart in the UK.
</li><li> Inverted with <em>Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice</em>. It was originally scheduled for a holiday 2015 release, but Sega decided to <a class="urllink" href="http://blogs.sega.com/2015/09/14/sonic-boom-fire-ice-moves-to-2016">delay the game to a 2016 release<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, likely not wanting to repeat the same mistakes they made with <em>Rise of Lyric</em>.
</li><li> Inverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em>, which almost fell victim to the same problems <em>'06</em> had. Having learned from their mistakes, Sega delayed both games, so that, instead of debuting in 2016 for Sonic's 25th anniversary, they came out the following year (<em>Mania</em> in mid-August, <em>Forces</em> in early November).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16h4s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16h4s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16h4s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Not that it did any good for <em>Forces</em>, since it eventually came out to a rather mediocre reception.</span>

The game was supposed to have 120 dragonflies instead of 90, feature both Gnasty Gnorc along Ripto as villains, over 25 levels with several homeworlds (instead of 9 levels and <em>1</em> home world), high framerates and low loading-times. It was rushed for Christmas and all we got was a glitchy mess with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfLoading">Loads and Loads of Loading</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">the loading screens have loading screens</a>), bad animation, and tons of lag.

However, the news that only the first game would be on the disk, with the other two games having to be downloaded from online stores made the developers convince Activision to delay the game's release to November to polish the game a bit more. To clarify, up until nearly a year after the PC and Switch release where new prints of the discs were released, <em>you still required downloading 2 out of the three games</em> on PS4 and Xbox One. Even the Switch port requires a patch to download the games's cinematics. So what was the delay in service of?. Well, we never found out, and the only port to escape this criticism was the PC port, which was digital only. Sanzaru Games was eventually brought on to work on <em>Year of the Dragon</em> while Toys for Bob worked on <em>Ripto's Rage</em> - and as revealed in 2020, while they were working on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot4ItsAboutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot4ItsAboutTime">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a></em> <em>as well</em>.

It even advertised itself as a simpler version of <em>Soul Calibur 4</em> for players new to the game, which is a way of the makers admitting they couldn't make it as good as they wanted to.
</li><li> An odd example occurs with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> series, as Activision orders their various studios to have games ready by Veterans Day. That the series has two different developers making every other new game in the series means nothing truly game-breaking slips through - but once the newest game is out, the other team basically have to drop their previous game entirely to shift focus entirely on their next one, so any glitches that aren't patched within a year of release will <em>never</em> be patched. As of 2014, the situation is lessened, now that <em>three</em> different studios are rotating development of new games in the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CarTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CarTycoon">Car Tycoon</a></em> was literally Christmas Rushed for Christmas 2001. It ended up not simply having a few bugs, but being borderline unplayable, something that even two bugfixes couldn't repair. For example, the cars sold by the four companies clogged the streets to the point of total gridlocks so it became impossible to even deliver new cars to the stores because the number of cars in the game, their lifespan, and the overall length of the streets were badly balanced. And if new cars couldn't get to the stores, they couldn't be sold, and you didn't make any money anymore.

The Spanish translation for the game wasn't going to make it in time, so to avoid having to delay the release date for all Europe (and miss the holiday season at it), it was not programmed into the game. Instead, a 150-page guide was printed and bundled with all copies of the game in Spain, which included all the English lines of text with their respective Spanish translations. While a creative workaround, the guide was certainly not handy to use for the players, especially with how non-linear the storyline is.

Reports are conflicting, but it seems clear that its hardware problems were known (although their full scope might not have been) and it was pushed out the door anyway on the theory that a year unopposed would balance out the cost of manufacturer-warranty repairs. There was also the issue of nVidia's contract to produce the original Xbox's graphics chip expiring, so Microsoft had to rush its next-gen console or else go an entire year without any console on the market.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ICO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ICO">ICO</a></em> was Christmas rushed, but curiously only in the NTSC region.

First of all, it meant that only six Saturn games were available at launch, and all of them were made by Sega. When Sega told everyone the thing was coming out in September, that included <em>the developers making video games for it.</em>"
</div></li><li> An aversion: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SWAT3">SWAT 3</a></em> was to suffer this, but the devs demanded more time to properly finish the game or else they'd cancel the project outright. Thankfully, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sierra">Sierra</a> budged and was lenient enough to give them a few months more to properly finish the game. In the end, it was a good decision, since the game became one of the most critically praised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FPS">FPSs</a> of the late 1990s.

Originally BioWare was working on a more direct sequel to <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> but due to the development of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em> taking way more time than expected, <em>EA</em> demanded BioWare to release a major game for early 2011. BioWare then was forced to scrap the <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> sequel and started working on the smaller <em>Dragon Age: Exodus</em>, <em>EA</em> then demanded the game to be renamed to <em>Dragon Age II</em> and to advertise it as a sequel to <em>Origins</em> against BioWare's wishes. Presumably the fallout this caused and the reputation hit caused to EA, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a>, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> franchise is (one of) the reason(s) why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em> was delayed to autumn 2014.
</li><li> According to some of the developers themselves, this was why <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> seemed to lack the depth of story that was present in the other games of the franchise, and why the ending of the game seems so arbitrary. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">Electronic Arts</a> wanted their cash cow, and they wanted it <em>now</em>, instead of the months it would have taken to wrap everything up properly. The irony here is that the game's March 2012 release date was <em>already</em> a delay: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.shacknews.com/article/68332/mass-effect-3-delayed-to">it was originally scheduled<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to be part of the 2011 holiday season. Apparently even this wasn't enough to truly polish the game up, however the game did have the most content-filled DLC of all three games to help bolster it post-release.

The official reason was for the games to have more time to be polished up, but gaming journalists and commentators have speculated that it was more so they wouldn't be overshadowed by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em> and so there wouldn't be a first-half-of-the-year game drought like in 2013 that would once again kill momentum for hardware sales (indeed, sales analysts have noted that February 2014 hardware sales for Wii U were significantly up over February 2013 thanks to <em>Tropical Freeze</em>).

Released in November 2005 - but the all new soundtrack was unfinished (the final boss used the standard boss theme, the secret area used the main map theme, unlike on SNES, the various Kong and Bear buildings shared one theme instead of having one each) and the character roll call was removed from the ending.

The game was also released with a noticeably barren (that is to say, three dungeons and a raid) endgame.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">3DS version</a> included these things.

</li><li> When first announced, the developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Defiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Defiance">Defiance</a></em> made a lot of pie-in-the-sky promises that unfortunately they were not able to implement because they were under a deadline to launch the game at the same exact moment the show began broadcasting.

</li><li> Phoenix, a very small video game company that was founded in the United Kingdom did this to nearly all their games, rushing the development to 3-5 months rather than 18 months just to give them an edge towards their competitors.

The former even had the added bonus that Microsoft knew it would be the Xbox's last blockbuster given the 360 was coming the following year. Both had the developer getting ambitious (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios">Retro Studios</a> refused to just recycle the features from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime">Metroid Prime</a></em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> had to discard the engine used for a <em>Halo</em> trailer because they discovered the Xbox couldn't handle it!) and choking on time constraints (Retro had only 30% of the game ready by June, Bungie cut so many features the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> list on a whiteboard <em>ran out of space</em> and the single player campaign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">ends in an abrupt</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a>).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJungleBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJungleBook">The Jungle Book</a></em> video game averts this. According to the holiday 1993 episode of the British video game review series, <em>Bad Influence!</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36ngx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note36ngx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36ngx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Series 2, episode 15</span>, it was scheduled for a 1993 holiday release. However, due to programming problems, the game was delayed until June 1994. Thanks to this decision, the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/NoProblemWithLicensedGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/NoProblemWithLicensedGames">a fun, polished platformer, with sprites looking just like the movie</a>, as with many of Disney's licensed games.
</li><li> It is very possible that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em> suffers from this. When fans looked at the game-files with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor">Level Editor</a>, it was revealed the creators planned to implement complex quests and scripts that sadly did not make the final cut. Examples are a dynamic civil war, an arena in Windhelm and quest to kill one of the Jarls. This is probably cut because the game had to be released on November the 11th 2011, so the creators did not have enough time to implement all of their plans. As a result, many of the storylines in the game feel rushed when compared to earlier installments of the franchise.
</li><li> While Bethesda was busy with Skyrim, they commissioned Obsidian Entertainment (a company composed of many of the original Fallout's developers) to make <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em>. The game clearly suffered from a lack of time (Obsidian had originally been given a somewhat loose promise of 2 years of development time, but Bethseda eventually cut it down to 18 months) as it recycled a lot of assets from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, reused a lot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> music, and with a ton of planned content cut out and plenty of bugs to go around. Even the part which shined the most- the story- was hurt by the rush as some storylines couldn't be fleshed out in time and were left rather simplistic. Fans didn't look kindly on the game recycling so many assets while critics were more positive- though not enough to earn a bonus for receiving a specific score from Metacritic. New Vegas was ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">Vindicated by History</a> thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4's</a></em> much divisive reception which established an undeniable pattern of Bethesda rushing games out the gate before they were ready. As such, many fans look back on New Vegas with more appreciation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordOfMagnaMaidenHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LordOfMagnaMaidenHeaven">Lord of Magna: Maiden Heaven</a></em> wasn't quite <em>Christmas</em> rushed, but the second half of the game was hastily put together because of difficulties with making the game itself and the future of the studio. They figured it would be better to release the game in such a state than risk not releasing it at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em> wasn't rushed for Christmas (or any holiday, really), but was pushed out early in February 2016 to get the basic multiplayer in the hands of players to practice for EVO and other tournaments in the summer. This came at the cost of various features not being available in the game until March<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4qz4d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4qz4d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4qz4d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Challenges/Trials, Lobbies bigger than 2 players, and the in-game shop.</span>, and the game's story mode not being available until June. And this is not even getting into Arcade Mode and endings, which wouldn't see the light of the day until <em>Arcade Edition</em> arrived in January 2018.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperNintendoEntertainmentSystem">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em> came out in Japan exactly one month after the console's 1990 launch and just four days before Christmas. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoOpMultiplayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoOpMultiplayer">Co-Op Multiplayer</a> mode, one of the stages and one of the three playable characters were lamentably removed, but such compromises probably helped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a> achieve their release date.
</li><li> The infamously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsGalaxies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsGalaxies">Star Wars: Galaxies</a></em> resulted in numerous delays before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> finally put their foot down and demanded that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyOnlineEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonyOnlineEntertainment">Sony Online Entertainment</a> release the game in summer of 2003. Unfortunately, the game was nowhere near ready and the lead developer later described frantically removing reams of incomplete code, to the point where the only incomplete code he wasn't removing was things that the game actually needed to run. With the benefit of hindsight, the end result of this rush could charitably be described as disastrous. The game was bug-ridden and largely devoid of content on launch, numerous promised features - like space travel, player-owned towns, and vehicles - had to be delayed to later patches and most of the underlying systems of the game were horrendously imbalanced and broken. Despite the best efforts of the developers, the game never truly recovered from the problems created by its early launch and most of the game's subsequent problems had their roots in the decision to gun for a Summer '03 launch window. <br/>Apparently not learning their lesson, SOE wound up doing this a second time in 2005 with the New Game Enhancements (NGE), a particularly reviled update that completely rewrote the game code from the ground up and dramatically changed the way the game was designed and played. A long-awaited Combat Upgrade launched in May of that year had gone over poorly with the community and the developers decided they needed something bigger to draw in more players. A conceptual mock-up of what would become the NGE was created and shared amongst the developers and producers. SOE gave the project a tentative go-ahead and the devs were given a mere six months to put together a complete rewrite of all of the game's core systems, all while putting together the game's third expansion pack AND maintaining the current code with regular updates. Several of the developers would later claim that those six months involved some of the highest workload they'd ever had to deal with and because SOE still hadn't fully decided to use the new system, they had to effectively code for two different game systems at once. The NGE was finally launched with two weeks warning to the players and managed to turn the game into an even buggier mess than it was at launch, resulting in an enormous exodus of players.
</li><li> According to then-president Tatsumi Kimishima, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> aimed to avert this with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Switch</a> in order to give it a stronger/more consistent lineup following launch, which is why it was released in March 2017 instead of November or December 2016. In the opinion of many gamers and analysts, and in light of the console's commercial success, it worked.
</li><li> A couple of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em> games have gone through this:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Up Your Arsenal</a></em> only had a year of development time (3 months preproduction, 9 months of actual production) and a good chunk of its development was spent on the new online multiplayer mode and getting the Galactic Rangers AI to work at all, and while the final game is far from unpolished, its obvious that they cut quite a few corners in design. The levels are much shorter and have fewer branching paths, the enemy variety was extremely downsized to save on art and animation time, several assets from the previous games (i.e. enemies, vehicles and music) are recycled, and a lot of content from the previous games (i.e. racing or fighting tournaments, space travel, grinding on rails, Giant Clank) got heavily scaled down or axed altogether. A few of the levels just flat out recycle the multiplayer maps to pad out the games length.

In the end the game turned out great and its production was surprisingly smooth (thanks to access to the original PS2 assets), and it became a critically acclaimed title and the fastest selling game in the series (likely due to not too many great exclusives on PS4 at the time). Averted twice thanks to the movie's release being a few months later than anticipated, giving a skeleton crew extra time to patch bugs and add in new features.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZDokkanBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZDokkanBattle">Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle</a></em>, to celebrate 200 million downloads, decided to push out two new characters for both the Japanese and Global versions of the game - Omega Shenron and Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>. However, Global players discovered that their Omega and Gogeta were broken - they did not come with Leader skills as the Japanese version used a system that hadn't been released on Global. Players were angry and memes were born.
</li><li> The NES port of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> was released in time for Christmas 1987 in Japan. It had some noticeable bugs due to them rushing to get it done before the holiday season. It's no surprise this port is commonly called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a> in hindsight compared to the MSX2 original.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatchBlasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatchBlasters">Yo-kai Watch Blasters 2</a></em>. Despite scoring slightly higher than the first <em>Blasters</em> in Famitsu reviews, it is considered by fans as the worst in the series because of several glitches (there are missing dialogue and models, you could get stuck on some dungeons, or you could not recruit some Yo-kai due to the heart ring suddenly dissapearing). Even after several patches, some glitches weren't fixed and others were created in the process. Fans think it was rushed because it had a minor delay (one week)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note550tw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note550tw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note550tw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It was unveiled in september, shortly after the last <em>Yo-kai Watch 3</em> update, and it was originally set for december 7th</span>. Likely due to this and the poor sales (it only made a third of what the first Blasters did in its first week, and less than most of the main games -except the first one- in the same time frame), it never got a third version update unlike <em>Yo-kai Watch 2</em>, <em>Blasters 1</em>, and <em>3</em>. It's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">not getting localized for Western markets</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokaiWatch4">Yo-kai Watch 4</a></em> taking the spotlight (that and the 3DS is basically retired in 2019).
</li><li> The PlayStation Classic was announced in September 2018 and was pushed out in December of the same year. The games listed were met with either disappointment or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoOkayItsAverage">So Okay, It's Average</a>, with some truly bizarre choices indicating a lack of thinking things through<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note618gc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note618gc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note618gc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona1">Revelations: Persona</a></em> - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekre</a> that has become irrelevant due to a PSP remake with much more faithful localisation and could have been substituted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a>: Eternal Punishment</em>, a game never released in PAL territories on any platform - and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a></em> - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortingDisaster">Porting Disaster</a> that almost anything else credible would have been better than</span>. People also discovered that the console was running on an open source emulator, which made Sony look incredibly lazy to some. On top of that, nine of the games ran in PAL mode, meaning those games ran slower at 50 hertz instead of 60 hertz that American gamers grew up on; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken3">Tekken 3</a></em> has been particularly found to suffer. When it eventually came out, the emulator settings weren't quite right for the hardware, resulting in shaky performance that the PAL games especially suffer from. Not only that, but plugging in certain USB keyboards allowed users to access the debug settings and one of said settings can force the PAL games to run in NTSC, and it was hacked to run non-stock games within days of release. On a less technical level, it should also be noted that the PlayStation's library is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSizeFitsAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSizeFitsAll">One Size Fits All</a> affair age rating wise like the NES and SNES libraries mostly are, which Sony clearly failed to consider, resulting in the K-A or E-rated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MrDriller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MrDriller">Mr. Driller</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rayman1995">Rayman</a></em> being in the same package as the M-rated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoClassic">Grand Theft Auto</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a>: Director's Cut</em>, with the PlayStation Classic's age ratings obviously reflecting the latter rather than the former, alienating parents whose kids were interested in the former; had Sony actually considered this, perhaps they would have released different models representing the kid-friendly fare and the more mature titles the PlayStation made popular, perhaps even one representing its JRPG library. With all the above issues, it certainly feels like Sony wanted to cash in on the classics hype without taking the time to refine their console.
</li><li> Believe it or not, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em> suffered from a <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171003014426/https://www.nintendo.com/super-nes-classic/interview-super-mario-world">rushed production schedule<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in a bid to compete with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>. It didn't stop the game from going on to being hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time, but the metric truckload of <a class="urllink" href="https://tcrf.net/Super_Mario_World_(SNES)">unused leftover content<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> makes it pretty clear there was a <em>lot</em> of things they simply didn't have time to make a part of the game.
</li><li> A very infamous example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarCraft">WarCraft</a> 3: Reforged</em>. While Activision and even Blizzard itself gained criticism due to rushing game releases even when they were not ready, no other game unleashed backlash for it on the same level as <em>Reforged</em>. The game was supposed to launch somewhere on late 2019, but the year passed by with no words from Blizzard on the release date, only for them to quickly come out in December to delay it to January 2020... Only for the game to be released in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">an egregiously unfinished state with an alarming amount of bugs that made it past beta</a>, and despite being a remaster of the original, it was missing about half of the online features the original game had since Day One (clan support, ladders, profiles, automated tournament, custom campaigns, being able to play offline and save the game in that case, and more) and the rush was so blatant that the game still said <em>Warcraft 3 Reforged Beta</em> in many parts of the menu/UI on release, no real keybinding support via the menu (you had to edit the controls by going to a TXT file in the game folder), and the game would disconnect or crash players at random, on top of placeholder models and being met with instant defeat screens on campaign mode. The backlash was so severe that Blizzard allowed refunds in less than a week since the game release.

Then their fully animated series would also fall into this as they often just finish the episodes the week of release. Miles Luna recalls he and Kerry Shawcross would downright sleep in the studio when finishing the early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webanimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webanimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>, and former employees <a class="urllink" href="https://rwbyconversations.tumblr.com/post/185614440311/rooster-teeth-glassdoor-crunchovertime">posted anonymous reviews on Glassdoors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> complaining about excessive and unpaid crunch time during 2018's production of both <em>RWBY</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webanimation/GenLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webanimation/GenLock">gen:LOCK</a></em> (it would later come out that <em>Gen:Lock</em> creator Gray Haddock - <a class="urllink" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EEr7KXjWwAA6hK-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">who said<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> seasons 9\10 of <em>RVB</em> and 1 of <em>RWBY</em> forced him to see his wife only 2-3 nights a week - was the one slave-driving everyone to get that series' premiere out on the same day as the <em>RWBY</em> season 6 finale).

It didn't hinder the quality of it compared to the rest of the show, but the characters' shading was scrapped except for scenes with dramatic lighting, and there are a few After Effects layering errors.
</li><li> Charles Schulz &amp; Bill Melendez were given only six months to complete <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ACharlieBrownChristmas">A Charlie Brown Christmas</a></em> in time for the holiday season, and Melendez couldn't start animating it until the third. As a result, the special is rife with stiff animation that goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a> several times (most notably Lucy phasing <em>through</em> her psychiatric booth and Linus's head vanishing in one frame) and stilted voice acting that was very clearly stitched together from numerous takes (remember that it was almost entirely done by real children at a time when child voice actors didn't exist, meaning that these kids lacked any professional experience). Luckily, the special was appealing enough to remain a holiday classic since it premiered; in fact, the shoddy quality of the special was able to gather a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NarmCharm">appeal</a> that permanently stuck with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> franchise.

This gave Lola just <em>four months</em> to design and build their car, which was nowhere near enough time. The result was a car with too much drag on the straights, not enough downforce in the corners, and a Ford engine that was outdated and underpowered but was all they'd been able to procure at such short notice. Lola failed to qualify for the first race by over <em>five seconds</em>, at which point MasterCard cut their losses and pulled the plug on the team.
