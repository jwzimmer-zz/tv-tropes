<p><span class="asscaps">Film</span>
</p><ul><li> In a scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NorthByNorthwest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NorthByNorthwest">North By Northwest</a></em>, Thornhill (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaryGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CaryGrant">Cary Grant</a>) is shot in the Mount Rushmore visitor center. After the scene was filmed, one could see that a little boy had put his hands on his ears <em>before</em> the gunfire. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlfredHitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> proclaimed that after this, he'd just work with people who were either adult or deaf.
</li><li> The aliens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></em> were played by young girls, who were hyperactive and incredibly difficult to control. In Bob Balaban's production diary, he said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> often began takes by yelling "Girls, stop disco-dancing!".
</li><li> In 2009, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColumbus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColumbus">Chris Columbus</a> talked about the progress of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> kids:
<div class="indent"><em>"My biggest pride is seeing the pictures now, and watching the three of them from a distance, and seeing them do an entire scene in one shot. Seriously, I know that sounds funny, but in the old days — and, you know, the old days meaning eight years ago — and in that first picture in particular, it's filled with cuts because they couldn't really get beyond the first line without either looking into the camera, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing">laughing</a>, or looking at the lights."</em>
</div><ul><li> There are two moments in <em>Philosopher's/Sorcerer's Stone</em> where one of the kids is silently mouthing the lines of a speaking co-star. During the jinxed broom sequence in the Quidditch match, Rupert Grint is mouthing "He's jinxing the broom!" when Emma Watson says the line, and when the kids are going to Hagrid's hut during the day towards the third act of the movie, Watson is mouthing all of Daniel Radcliffe's exposition as they walk side-by-side.
</li><li> A minor example at the end of <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>. Hermione was down in the script to hug Harry and Ron, but Emma Watson was too embarrassed to hug both boys in front of a set full of people (it's in the Great Hall). They came up with the compromise that she would only hug Harry and give Ron an awkward handshake. In post-production, they even had to slow down the film when Hermione is hugging Harry - because Emma kept breaking it too quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1994 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen">Little Women</a></em> had a two-fer for a scene in which the fourteen-year-old Claire Danes had to hold a crying baby. The baby was screaming quite loudly, and Claire has admitted she was so freaked out by the noise she nearly burst into tears as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedMethodActing">Thankfully that worked for the context of the scene</a> (Beth getting ill from the Hummels' young baby).
</li><li> Several examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>:
<ul><li> Filming was often delayed by having to calm down the twin babies who played Sunny, as they often burst out crying at inopportune times. One funny outtake also has one of the babies fall asleep during a take, much to the amusement of the rest of the cast, who try to gently wake her up.
</li><li> Also, Liam Aiken (Klaus) started filming the film shorter than Emily Browning (Violet), but hit a growth spurt, finishing the film <em>taller</em> than her. They had to keep filming with Browning standing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScullyBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScullyBox">boxes</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> During the production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersInc">Monsters, Inc.</a></em>, the crew was having difficulty getting Boo's toddler voice actress to sit still in a booth and read her lines. They ended up just following her around the studio with a boom mike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">and working with what they got.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MamoruOshii">Mamoru Oshii</a>'s crew just couldn't get the performance they wanted out of the child actress who played the ghost in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avalon">Avalon</a></em>. They ended up faking it by morphing several of her performances together.
</li><li> It took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCagney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesCagney">James Cagney</a> to set the Dead End Kids straight on the set of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelsWithDirtyFaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelsWithDirtyFaces">Angels with Dirty Faces</a></em>. They threw off other actors with their ad-libbing and went so far as to terrorize Humphrey Bogart.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent">Maleficent</a></em>, the scene that kicked off the title character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> was when 2-year-old Aurora approached Maleficient in the woods and wasn't afraid, as the child's innocence still saw the good in her. Unfortunately, the toddler actresses they tested were too frightened by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a>'s costume to go near her. They found the perfect solution by getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeRelative">Jolie's daughter Vivienne</a> to play the part, since she still recognized her mother and was naturally calm around her.
</li><li> Most of the child actors from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WillyWonkaAndTheChocolateFactory">Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</a></em> were well-behaved. That is, except for Paris Themmen (Mike Teevee) who was an absolute nightmare while filming. Themmen opened a glass dome containing the wasp colony for the inventing room scene, which led to the set having to be evacuated and him getting stung multiple times. At one point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneWilder">Gene Wilder</a> (Willy Wonka) himself said, "I'm going to shoot [him] in the head tomorrow."
</li><li> The opening scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSantaClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSantaClause">The Santa Clause</a></em> <em>2</em> had to be reshot several times because the actors playing the elves kept pinching and hitting each other. Eventually, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimAllen">Tim Allen</a> lost his temper and let out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Precision F-Strike</a>, shocking the kids.
</li><li> In the final scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartIII">Back to the Future Part III</a></em>, one of the child actors playing one of Doc's sons standing behind him is making pained faces, looks like he's about to cry and is subtly pointing at his crotch, indicating he really needs to pee.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Live Action Television</span>
</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenColbert">Stephen Colbert</a> interviewing the oil industry on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a></em> - it agreed to speak only if it could be represented by an eight-year-old girl. The girl was Madeleine Colbert, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeRelative">his daughter</a>, and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/zorse42/video/14238441">the outtakes are adorable.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In an example <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">that made it into the show proper</a>, infants Winnie and Nelson on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow">The Cosby Show</a></em> would frequently look at the studio lights, boom mike, or other overhead machinery. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a> (as Cliff Huxtable) would look in the same direction and ask what was so interesting about the ceiling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway">Project Runway</a></em> occasionally has challenges featuring children.
<ul><li> One season the designers had to make complementary mom-and-child outfits, and in another designers had to make outfits based on paintings from students at Harlem School of the Arts. The designers' reactions are often just as fascinating as the kids', as even the designers with really temperamental and drama-prone personalities tend to be on their nicest behavior.
</li><li> And episode 11 of season 10 forces the designers to take care of baby dolls that cry (the type given to high schoolers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">Scare 'Em Straight</a> sex ed classes) while working on their garments to simulate taking care of an actual child (not to mention being a fairly obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatingsStunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatingsStunt">Ratings Stunt</a>) but the actual babies are more cooperative, minus Dmitry's, who falls asleep and has to be carried by his mom while "walking" the runway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopChef">Top Chef</a></em> has had kids on as well. Though the kids are usually well-behaved and happy to taste the food, several contestants had trouble coming up with dishes that the kids <em>and</em> the professional chef judges will all like. They either make their dishes too complicated, or they assume kids don't eat anything but chicken nuggets and make a dish the adults hate. Season 1's Tiffany in particular was adamant about her dislike of cooking for children.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DickAndDomInDaBungalow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DickAndDomInDaBungalow">Dick &amp; Dom in da Bungalow</a></em> ran on getting a bunch of kids to play silly games and throw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInGunge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInGunge">gunge</a> over each other, live. It's not surprising they sometimes got a bit <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM6J_P3APXk&amp;t=0m25s">overexcited.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> One boy, Raja, almost broke the hosts — he wouldn't stop running round and hitting them. Dom stopped being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcitedKidsShowHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcitedKidsShowHost">Excited Kids' Show Host</a> and started just telling him off and asking the producers what to do next; they even got him on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaDickAndDomDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaDickAndDomDiaries">Da Dick And Dom Diaries</a>, four years later, to explain himself. ("I'm a really nice guy when you get to know me".)
</li><li> The little girl of perhaps ten or eleven (Melissa Wilkes, who went on to play Jackie Wright in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrangeHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GrangeHill">Grange Hill</a></em>), on a Saturday morning zoo show, who was innocent of the subtleties of French pronunciation. Given a link to do concerning the afternoon's sporting attractions, she read off the autocue:
<div class="indent"> And this afternoon at two, we go to Murray Walker who will commentate on the Grand Pricks of South Africa..
</div><div class="indent"> <em>(Producer):</em> I think you'll find it's pronounced "Grond Pree"...
</div><div class="indent"> <em>(Little Girl, after a second's consideration):</em> Well, it says "Grand Pricks" here!
</div></li><li> On an episode of the kids' game show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyChallenge">Family Challenge</a></em>, host Ray Combs learned the hard way something that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">Bob Barker</a> once told him: "never let the contestant hold the microphone." He handed the mic to a five-year-old contestant who socked him in the head with it hard enough to make him bleed. He had to get stitches during the next break and spent the rest of the episode with a band-aid on his head.

<ul><li> Even the act of a baby tearing up a cake is too much: one segment had a competition to see what baby would make the biggest mess, with cakes provided by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CakeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CakeBoss">Buddy Valastro</a>. The babies were evidently distracted by the cheering crowd and camera/lighting equipment and barely touched the cakes.
</li><li> There also have been several times when they had babies involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">viral videos</a> on the show to repeat what they did in the video, like for example the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JmA2ClUvUY">arguing twin babies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who would either start crying or look around confused.
</li></ul></li><li> It's not always a bad thing. While filming one scene of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BreakingBadS5E14Ozymandias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BreakingBadS5E14Ozymandias">Ozymandias</a>", the baby who was playing Walt's daughter Holly started crying for her mother (who was standing just off-camera). In context — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Walt had gone on the run after a vicious fight with Skyler and had kidnapped the baby as he left, and the script called for him to spend a few moments with her before deciding to give her back</span> — it worked <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">brilliantly</a></em>, and a bit of reactive improvisation from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanCranston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanCranston">Bryan Cranston</a> allowed them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Throw It In!</a>.
</li><li> According to Robert Singer, the director of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS02E21AllHellBreaksLoosePartOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS02E21AllHellBreaksLoosePartOne">"All Hell Breaks Loose, Part One" (S02, Ep21)</a>, getting blood into the baby's mouth was the most difficult special effect in the whole episode. The baby was evidently having a bad day and started crying even before they started trying to drip fake blood into the baby's mouth.
</li><li> Several examples in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> series:
<ul><li> For the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS01E16IfWishesWereHorses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS01E16IfWishesWereHorses">If Wishes Were Horses</a>" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, Hana Hatae, playing Molly O'Brien, had to run in the room and exclaim to her parents that Rumpelstiltskin was in the room (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>). On the day that was supposed to be shot, Hana had a cold and was being uncooperative. The director begged her and eventually promised her one of her character's toys if she performed (disregarding whether they could be given away). Hana ended up performing the scene well, which impressed the camera man so much he screwed up the take. To paraphrase the book <em>Deep Space Nine Companion</em>, "the shot was completed in 6-7 takes... and 6-7 toys."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> had a problem in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS2E16QWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS2E16QWho">Q Who</a>": the baby playing the baby Borg kept chewing on its cable. While some crew thought it was cute, the director kept at it until he got a take where the baby left it alone.
</li><li> Other than the previous examples, <em>Star Trek</em> usually averts this trend despite children making several appearances across the franchise (although Rick Berman once joked to Adam Nimoy, director of the kid-centric "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS6E7Rascals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS6E7Rascals">Rascals</a>", that the TNG producers owe him an episode with just adults). In short, the only problems are following child labor laws when using them. (In <em>TNG</em>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E5Disaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E5Disaster">Disaster</a>", the baby playing newborn Molly O'Brien was specifically not allowed to be covered in strawberry jelly because of allergies she may have had. The filmmakers had to use cherry.)
</li></ul></li><li> One early segment on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> was supposed to involve Kermit the Frog and a young girl named Joey singing the Alphabet Song, but when Joey starts singing, she keeps shouting "Cookie Monster" at random parts and laughing. Jim Henson stays in character, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">decides to run with it by having Kermit react and try to correct her.</a> The result ends up being very funny and adorable at the same time.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em>, the twins playing baby Lily became increasingly difficult to work with as they became toddlers.

<ul><li> Cole Sprouse was quite a difficult child on set when doing the episode where Ben learns pranks from Rachel. As he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurningBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadTurningBeauty">so in awe of Jennifer Aniston's beauty</a> he was often left speechless. They had to just going for retakes until he spoke in their scenes.

<ul><li> One child actress was confused by the other actor's line being "where's your mother?" and kept pointing to her real mother instead of the actress playing her mother. She was confused when her mother said "pretend that lady is your mommy for now", so they solved it by placing the real mother just off camera - so that when the girl pointed, it would seem like she was pointing at her co-star.
</li><li> A classically trained method actor who was more used to being in dramas struggled to react to a cartoon that hadn't been animated yet for a commercial. He was literally unable to laugh like a normal child (something his co-star had no trouble with).
</li><li> Thankfully subverted in the story of a pilot that never got picked up. It was about a monster who befriends children, so of course on set the children had to act opposite a green blob. They told the child actors the following:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> 'Jody told the girl, "This is a nice man pretending to be a big kitty, but we haven't put the rest of him on yet ... He doesn't feel good about himself for not looking like the others. Can you make him feel better when you see him?" The girl ran to the homunculus, hugged him, and said, "You're pretty to me." The show never got picked up, but that take was gold.'
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNutters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNutters">The Nutters</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first film has a scene where a child intimidates Eoin as soon as he arrives. Jordan Lennon jokes that they knocked on a bunch of doors to find a child to do the scene, and bribed him with sweets to say yes. The child struggled to do the simple stunt of walking up to Eoin and kicking his suitcase, but his mother then suggested he just run off with the bag instead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">That was the take they used</a>.
</li><li> For the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">Christmas Special</a>, Greg Young's nine-year-old sister was going to be featured in the scene where Eoin Facetimes Jake. Presumably for this reason, it was changed to his dad instead.
</li><li> And of course, the fact that the film was made by a group of fifteen and sixteen-year-olds is an example of the trope. The boys have since described it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieMakingMess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieMakingMess">Movie-Making Mess</a> - as they had barely any script and admitted some of the plot made no sense.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>, a large bird walked on to the set during the filming of one of the scenes. At one point, it's clearly visible extending its wing... however, it was a silhouette, and it was hard to tell it was a bird... and not the corpse of a Munchkin.

One is that Johnny Weissmuller was advised to keep a sock full of quarters handy when dealing with the chimp, just in case it tried to attack him. Sure enough, Cheetah attacked him and Johnny hit him with the quarters and legend has it from that day on Johnny and Cheetah were the best of pals.

Whole books have been written about the horror stories of over 1200 animals refusing to obey directions, including ducks forgetting how to swim and needing to be rescued, a goat that ate a script, a parrot yelling "Cut!", a squirrel that refused to sit still until it was rendered drunk, a piglet that had to be replaced multiple times due to outgrowing its own role, and a giraffe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">that stepped on Rex Harrison's crotch.</a>
</li><li> Quite famously the film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cujo">Cujo</a></em> experienced some major difficulties with working with its St. Bernard actors. Namely, the dogs (St. Bernards are basically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFriendlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFriendlyDog">Big Friendly Dog</a>) were, in perhaps the ultimate extreme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanCharacterNiceActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanCharacterNiceActor">Mean Character, Nice Actor</a>, unable to behave aggressively to the human actors no matter how they were coerced. For many scenes, a cunningly disguised Rottweiler had to be used. A few scenes were ruined because the dogs would stop to lick the rabid blood and drool goop (in reality cream and egg white with red food dye) off their faces. For other shots "Cujo's" tail had to be taped down or kept out of frame because the dog kept happily wagging it whenever they saw the actors or their trainer.
</li><li> During the filming of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheElusiveAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheElusiveAvengers">The Elusive Avengers</a></em>, the crew had a lot of trouble making the horses stand still for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandInTheSaddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandInTheSaddle">Land in the Saddle</a> scene. In the end, they just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliciousDistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliciousDistraction">smeared some sugar syrup on the walls in front of them</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Roar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Roar">Roar</a></em> is largely known for this, being a film focused on big cats with some <em>very</em> reckless production. Most of the cats (including around 150 lions) involved weren't actually trained. It's estimated that over seventy people were injured on-set, and some of the actors claim that this was lowballing it. One of the main problems was that the film heavily involved people being scared of and running away from big cats, but ultimately learning that the cats aren't dangerous... but the thing is, acting terrified of a predatory animal and running away from it is a good way to make it interpret you as prey. The kicker? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TippiHedren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TippiHedren">Tippi Hedren</a> adopted most of the animals used in the shoot!
</li><li> Tippi Hedren had experienced this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBirds">The Birds</a></em> for the famous sequence in which Melanie is attacked in the attic. Lied to by the director that they'd be using mechanical birds, she arrived on set to find that she'd be getting live ones thrown at her. When that didn't work, they tied them to her costume. She became so distressed by the end of that week, the studio doctor overruled Alfred Hitchcock and gave her a week's bed rest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RebeccaMader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RebeccaMader">Rebecca Mader</a> tells the story at conventions about a horror film she once did - not mentioning the title (though possibly she meant <em>Mimic 3</em>) - which was filmed near a dog shelter. As a result most of the audio was filled with the sounds of dogs barking, so she had to ADR all her lines. Or as she puts it "three weeks of screaming in six hours".
</li><li> For the scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfOfWallStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfOfWallStreet">The Wolf of Wall Street</a></em> where Jonah Hill has to eat a goldfish, PETA were on set with about four goldfish wranglers to make sure he only had the fish in his mouth for four seconds apiece. Despite this, a fish urinated in his mouth.
</li><li> The giant octopus Oodako in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKongVsGodzilla">King Kong vs. Godzilla</a></em> was at times played by live octopi on a miniature set. But according to the assistant special effects director in an interview many years later, it took forever to get the cephalopods to actually crawl around. They didn't move when poked with sticks and cigarettes, splashed with water, or getting air blown on them, but eventually they figured out that aiming a beam of light at them got the animals moving.
</li><li> The 1964 film <em>Giant Horde Beast Nezura</em> was canceled because the <strong>untrained sewer rats</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Daiei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Daiei">Daiei</a> used for the titular monsters were spreading disease and parasites among the filming crew and there were worries they would escape into nearby towns. But not giving up on making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">kaiju</a> movie, they opted for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleInRubberSuits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleInRubberSuits">suit approach</a> in their next production about a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gamera">fire-breathing flying turtle</a>... and the rest is history.
</li><li> Noted animal trainer, Mel Hurtig, noted an aversion of this trope when dealing with an incontinent duck during the shooting of one film. One male lead complained loudly about it and resisted working with it, but the female lead insisted on having the duck with her near-constantly during shooting, messy business and all. The male lead was eager to let her do that, until a crew worker explained why she did that: by playing with a cute duck, that leading lady drew more attention by the camera crew and editors and thus had more screen time for herself for the film. Obviously, being able to hog the spotlight was worth dealing with the mess.
</li><li> The 'horse of a different colour' in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> kept licking the dye turning its coat different colors in between takes (which was jello powder).
</li><li> The cat playing Claude in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackChristmas1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackChristmas1974">Black Christmas (1974)</a></em> proved difficult for the scene where he jumps on Clare's corpse in the rocking chair and licks her face. After trying to coax the cat multiple times, director Bob Clark physically threw him onto Lynne Griffin. They also sprayed her face with catnip so the cat would lick her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummy1999">The Mummy (1999)</a></em>, according to the director's commentary, the struggle that Beni is having with his camel towards the end wasn't planned—the camel itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodyMount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodyMount">decided not to move</a> and that wasn't the only time they had trouble with the camels, which are generally notorious for being hard to work with.

</li><li> <em>Late Night With Conan O'Brien</em> once did a sketch that briefly involved a duck. The duck did several unexpected things, most notably pooping on the studio floor and then eating it. Conan reacted with genuine shock, including an unusual instance of swearing that had to be bleeped (even though the show isn't aired live, he usually avoids certain words). "We've got a sh**-eating duck out here!" They capitalized on this incident in several follow-up sketches, in which the duck became known as "Quackers, The Sh**-Eating Duck."
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> Smeg-Ups had two instances of animal trouble:

In the show itself this happens a lot as well, such as in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiVndB8bFlw">this montage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the most memorable animal moments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEponymousShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEponymousShow">The Tony Danza Show</a></em>. Tony for a time had this parrot named "Rocky" on the show and he would constantly try to get it to do tricks and it <em>never</em> cooperated with him.
</li><li> Gerald Durrell had no <em>choice</em> but to work with animals for a few TV shows. There are probably retired TV station employees still walking a little funny after Delilah the porcupine.
</li><li> Likely to occur on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a></em> whenever animals are involved.
<ul><li> Jamie's immortal line: "Quack, damn you." They needed to get a duck to quack for testing if a duck's quack echoes, but their ducks were very silent. Luckily, they eventually figured out the formula: make two ducks face each other and they start quacking like mad.
</li><li> During a segment in the <em>Shop Till You Drop</em> special, Jamie jokingly brings upp this trope while talking about animal suppliers at the same time as he is struggling to hold a huge varan lizard that clearly does not want to be there. This scene is later shown in an extended form during <em>Mythbusters Revealed</em> where this trope is also invoked.
</li><li> The Build Team tried to make the famous fainting goats faint but they failed. The goats did faint in reaction to everything else from a passing car to the nearby cameraman.
</li><li> They also once attempted to test the theory that running in a zig-zag will help you dodge a crocodile... but couldn't get the crocodiles to actually chase them or the rig they built carrying a chicken carcass as bait. At one point the crocodile (regularly fed by the sanctuary where the episode was being filmed, mind you) looked at the chicken as if to consider it for a moment, and then seemed to go "nah, not worth it" and ignored it. Incidentally, this helped bust the myth since crocodiles are ambush predators and don't tend to chase their prey much beyond the water, and the myth was busted not because it didn't work, but because it wasn't <em>necessary</em>. (Of course, if the croc/gator hasn't eaten awhile or it's mating season, when the males get territorial... there's a reason the show's motto is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTryThisAtHome">Do Not Try This at Home</a>.)
</li><li> One of the earlier episodes had Adam and Jamie trying to test out cures for skunk spray. They had everything figured out, except for how to get the skunks to actually spray them. Eventually they bought some in a bottle, and subsequently used a room that the skunk had sprayed for testing.
</li><li> Their attempt at herding cats also went exactly like you'd expect, and even the sheepdog they brought in had no luck. Adam eventually resorted to picking them up and manually placing them in the corral, and even <em>that</em> didn't work as the cats just ran out again.
</li><li> Averted in the "Bird Balance" myth; Kari says that despite what they say about working with animals, the birds were all very cooperative.
</li><li> To their surprise, real actual bulls busted that bulls in a China shop would prove disastrous for the shopowner: they were all smart enough to recognize that it was probably not a good idea to approach displays the Mythbusters built in their pen <em>and</em> agile enough to <em>trot</em> around them. The crew also commented on how nimble and careful the bulls were even when moving fast. (The most destructive creature during the episode? Tory, whose bumbling, both accidental and deliberate, broke several items.)
</li><li> One more gruesome example occurred when testing a myth about whether the cereal box is more nutritious than the cereal. One group of mice were given cereal to eat, another group of mice were given cardboard to eat... but the mice given cardboard instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">ate</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">each other</a></em>. Understandably, this particular myth ended up unaired.

<ul><li> In one episode, Gonzo tried to do a dancing chicken act and got a real-live hen on stage. The chicken didn't dance, much to his annoyance, but it did do an okay split at the end.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeBurns">George Burns</a> once related to Rowlf the time he did this vaudeville act of holding a dog in his arms while singing a song. The dog bit him halfway through.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidAttenborough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidAttenborough">David Attenborough</a> recalled in a preface to some of his <em>Zoo Quest</em> books the 1950 weekly BBC TV programme of the same name with George Cansdale of London Zoo. Cansdale would bring an animal, put it on the desk and talk about it. Since film was expensive, all broadcasts were live, and misbehaving animals were part of the programme's charm. Most troubles involved either an animal relieving itself on the table or Cansdale's trousers, or less often trying to escape or biting. However, taking photos of animals seems to be the least of Attenborough's problems in the <em>Zoo Quest</em> books.
<ul><li> Attenborough himself has ended up on the receiving end of this, though <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJaNDBI87s">he seems to take it in good humor.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> On one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightOutOfTenCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EightOutOfTenCats">8 Out of 10 Cats</a> Does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Countdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Countdown">Countdown (2017)</a></em>, Jimmy Carr attempted to distract the panel by bringing out two baskets of kittens.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Edmonton</a> weatherman Mike Sobel learned this the hard way while trying to do <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ntWcpw0esE">a live forecast featuring a dog named Ripple from the local animal shelter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> One television reporter <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okJL4x8NWrs">learned the hard way<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> why it's a <em>very</em> bad idea to get up close and personal with a dog who doesn't know you (especially one who, in this case, had been through a very traumatic event where it had to be rescued from a frozen lake only the day before).

But, at least, looking back, he can laugh about them.

</li><li> During the London run of <em>Serena Blandish</em>, Constance Collier had to make a dramatic entrance with two colossal greyhounds. Perhaps unwisely, Miss Collier and the dogs waited to make their entrance immediately behind the doors through which they were going to enter. When their cue came, the doors were flung open and the hounds, accustomed to starting races in this manner, tore off across the stage (dragging their holder behind them) and out through the fireplace, allowing Collier only a split second to duck to avoid decapitation!

Outtakes also show that the human and animal actors tended to botch their scenes in about equal proportions.
</li><li> The video for "End Love" also featured several geese that wander in and out of the shots at various times, and one in particularly named Maria (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTomcatIsPregnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTomcatIsPregnant">which is actually a male goose</a>) was initially hostile to them but eventually seemed to adopt them over the course of a few days, and follows them through a large part of the video.

Unfortunately, the birds had been cooped up in dark drum cases and would not fly away. Most of them did leave their confines, but congregated on the field and refused to leave. The Chief Judge scared some of them away by firing his timing pistol at them. Corps members had to return to the field and pick up the doves that they couldn't shoo away, often resulting in soiled uniforms. They were able to remove the birds before the next corps (the Sunrisers) took the field <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14mro');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14mro" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14mro');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> had they taken too long, they would have incurred a costly penalty</span>.

</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Professional Wrestling</span>
</p><ul><li> Professional wrestlers have been taking on animals in the ring since the 1930s. In North America, the animal was traditionally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bearsarebadnews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bearsarebadnews">bear</a>, whom would used to sell a "bear handler gimmick" of a wrestler who would sometimes get his opponents to wrestle the animal in his place. Ginger was one of the first bears, "Terrible" Ted was the most famous, and Smokey was the most dangerous. In Asia, the animal was usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSmileAtACrocodile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSmileAtACrocodile">crocodile</a>, where two wrestlers would have a match and the loser would then have to wrestle the animal, as Big Japan Pro Wrestling continued to do well after everyone else started phasing this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GimmickMatches">gimmick match</a> out. No one actually liked doing this for anything other than the pay check. Either the animal was borderline diseased and hard to get anything out of, like "Terrible Ted", or it wasn't and thus was extremely dangerous like Smokey, who actually managed to maul someone to death. A bear can at least be pinned for three seconds, even if a more docile one doesn't realize a match is going on, or that the match is over in the more hostile specimens. It's never <em>easy</em> but pinning a crocodile is a lot trickier(and you'd be hard pressed to find a "docile" crocodile)
</li><li> Ada Ash mixed things up by being a crocodile handler. And by handler we mean she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse">carried the things around</a> in public. Not sure being crazy was just a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGimmick">gimmick</a>" there.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a> has tried to work with animals on a few occasions. It has never worked out.
<ul><li> During the early 90s, the British Bulldogs were given a mascot in an actual bulldog named Matilda. Bulldogs are normally very placid and safe for using even on live television, but Afa <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWildSamoans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWildSamoans">the Wild Samoan</a> had gotten her a big drink just before the British Bulldogs match. Matilda took a gigantic pee in the ring, infuriating the wrestlers who had to work on the urine-soaked mat, and getting WWF banned from Boston for several years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> once had to chase a chicken in a training scene for a match with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>. Problem was it was cold and snowy out. The chicken wasn't having any of it, and refused to do anything at all. Vince actually belly-flopped into the snow and flailed around trying to make the chicken run from him, to no avail. Eventually he and Shane just picked the poor chicken up and laughed about the whole thing not working.
</li><li> In the execrable Kennel from Hell match (from the 1999 <em>Unforgiven</em> pay-per-view), the gimmick was that in between the two cages that make up Hell in a Cell, there would be two ferocious guard dogs. The problem was that the dogs (two rottweilers) weren't remotely ferocious. They defecated at ringside, mated, tried to get petted by the fans, and generally acted like overgrown puppies.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>:
<ul><li> They booked a match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts">Jake "The Snake" Roberts</a> where the finish was for Jake to sic a (real, but devenomised) cobra on Sting, only to have it turn on him. But Jake couldn't get the snake to bite him, so he ended up holding it to his face while it flailed stupidly.
</li><li> You'd think they'd have learned what a bad idea this was from Jake's run in the WWF, specifically the time where he'd sicced his cobra on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a> while the Macho Man was tied up in the ring ropes. That time it had worked <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">too</a></em> well, as the (devenomised) snake sank its fangs into Savage's arm and wouldn't let go, forcing Jake to desperately try and dislodge the annoyed reptile from Savage while doing his best to preserve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">The cobra later died after biting Savage.</a>
</li><li> While they weren't exactly "working" with the animal since it wasn't supposed to do anything but be there, the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/WrestleCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/WrestleCrap">WrestleCrap</a>-worthy) match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk">Terry Funk</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisCandido" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisCandido">Chris Candido</a> almost went horribly wrong when the WCW staff thought there was no problem having the two men brawl their way into a stable which contained a real live 400-pound horse. Funk had insisted the horse be tranquilised to make sure it was calm, but it wasn't enough, and when Funk gave Candido a piledriver in the stable right next to the animal (which wasn't even tied up) the horse got spooked and kicked Funk in the arm. Candido <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">panicked</a>, stopped selling the piledriver and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">scrambled out of the stable</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Funk</a> just shouted <em>"You fucking horse! I'll kick your ass!"</em> and went on to finish beating Candido down for the win, despite the fact that if the horse had aimed about six inches higher it might have <em>ripped his head off!</em> Funk even later stated that if the horse hadn't already been tranquilised the kick might actually have killed him.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron">Lisa Marie Varon</a> introduced a pet tarantula called Poison when she showed up in TNA as Tara, but wisely kept her locked in a cage that she just brought with her to the ring and gave to a stage hand during the match. She did however occasionally let her out of the cage to crawl on her opponents. Perhaps for this reason, Poison was phased out after she'd been there about a year. Additionally, TNA were legally obligated to provide a handler at ringside whenever the spider was used. According to Lisa, the handler was paid "more than the wrestlers".

However, Shakespeare never included a dog in a major role again, and scholars speculate that he learned this trope the hard way.

</li></ul></li><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam">Space Jam</a></em>, where Daffy, after escaping Michael Jordan's dog with the help of his children, quips "This is the last time I'm working with dogs or children!"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonIsaacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonIsaacs">Jason Isaacs</a> (Hook/Mr.Darling) says "Never work with children or animals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsBreadedEggs">or animal like children</a>" on a behind the scenes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> when the kids are mucking around, seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGGD6AlJiRU">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> cited this trope in his review of <em>Picture Perfect</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ebert</strong>: It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WCFields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WCFields">W.C. Fields</a> who hated to appear in the same scene with a child, a dog, or a plunging neckline—because nobody in the audience would be looking at you. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferAniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> has the same problem in this movie even when she's in scenes all by herself.
</div></li><li> Zig-zagged in-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willow">Willow</a></em>. The first time Willow performs his "disappearing pig" trick, the pig escapes, revealing that the trick was mere slight-of-hand. Everybody laughs, and Willow is shamed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the climax, Willow performs a "disappearing baby" trick with the much more immobile Elora Danan, and Queen Bavmorda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDisposingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDisposingVillain">falls for it</a>.</span>
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Live Action Television</span>
</p><ul><li> This trope is exploited in-universe on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap">Quantum Leap</a></em>. Al was supposed to appear in the form of a hologram that only Sam could see and hear, but since animal and child actors couldn't just be asked to ignore him, they actually made it a plot point that they had special neurological features that made Al visible and audible to them. Al even made use of this trope to save lives, such as when he warns a black children's choir in the 1960s that Klansmen were approaching to burn down the church and to get the adults to leave with them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorstWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorstWitch">The Worst Witch</a></em> (1998 series) was about a girls' school for witches, where each student gets her own pet cat. So it was a cast full of child actresses <em>and</em> one cat for each of them:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FelicityJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FelicityJones">Felicity Jones</a> talks about the difficulties of working with cats on the show. It was incredibly difficult to make it look like the cats weren't trying to claw the actresses' faces off.
</li><li> Thankfully this wasn't a problem in scenes with Mildred's cat Tabby - who is meant to be difficult and afraid of flying. Still it's telling that whenever the witches were shown flying, the books' tradition of having the cats ride on the back of the brooms wasn't kept. In the one scene where it was (adapting <em>The Worst Witch All At Sea</em>) it was a plot point that the girls just had the cat baskets hanging off the brooms (as Mildred is trying to hide Tabby).
</li><li> In the first episode it's quite obviously a blue-screened tarantula crawling over Mildred's hands. Presumably to spare thirteen-year-old Georgina Sherrington having to hold a live spider - as Mildred is meant to love them.
</li><li> Mildred's pet bats are mostly shown sleeping upside down, allowing the show to use dummies with bat sounds dubbed in. The one time the bats are shown in flight, it's obvious CGI.
</li></ul></li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Theatre</span>
</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoelCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NoelCoward">Noël Coward</a> once attended a play featuring an irritating child actor, in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadApples" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadApples">a horse also defecated onstage</a>. Supposedly, he quipped, "If they had shoved the child's head up the horse's arse, they'd have solved two problems at once."
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discussed</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a>'s book <em>Leonard: My Fifty-Year Friendship With a Remarkable Man</em>. He was talking with Steve Guttenberg about the play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeMenAndABaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeMenAndABaby">Three Men and a Baby</a></em> and asked him if the adage among actors that the hardest thing to do was to work with animals and babies was true. Guttenberg smiled, shook his head, and told him "That's not true at all. The hardest thing is not working."

There have been some who have heeded this advice. They include:
<p><span class="asscaps">Film</span>
</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NatalieWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NatalieWood">Natalie Wood</a> was known for being very easy to work with on set, and was so good at remembering her lines that they nicknamed her "One Take Natalie".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringingUpBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BringingUpBaby">Bringing Up Baby</a></em> was quite an achievement in film, considering it was a 1930s comedy with a live leopard on set. There was only one incident involving the (tame!) animal; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatharineHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatharineHepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> wore a skirt with lots of metal rings to make it swing beautifully, and at one point she twirled too quickly and the leopard lunged at her (saved by the trainer's whip however). Overall, Katharine Hepburn was quite fearless around the leopard while Cary Grant was less so - requiring doubles for lots of scenes where David interacts with Baby.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoneyIShrunkTheKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoneyIShrunkTheKids">Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</a></em>, is at least knowledgeable about it, as they have Quark do VERY little in the show. Though, at least one episode includes quite a lot of reaction shots from him...
</li><li> In <em>Gorillas in the Mist</em>, Dian Fossey described one of her early attempts that resulted in her then-best photos. When she approached a group of sunbathing gorillas, they hid in bushes. She decided to climb a nearby tree to get a better view. Since she had little experience climbing trees, wasn't in her best shape and was encumbered with cameras and other stuff, it took her a lot of time, and the process has been quite noisy. She expected the noise to scare the gorillas away, but instead "I was amazed to look around and find that the entire group had returned and were sitting like front-row spectators at a sideshow. All that was needed to make the image complete were a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThePopcorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassThePopcorn">gorilla-sized bags of popcorn and some cotton candy</a>!" She quickly learned to use the apes' curiosity to overcome their fear and keep them where they are best visible.
