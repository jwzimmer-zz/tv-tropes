It could also be a prominent fringe benefit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">broader power</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">telepathy</a> to directly reveal deceptive intent or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a> to detect subtle variations in the speaker's heartbeat, breathing, etc.
</p><p>Some characters get the added bonus of being able to <em>force</em> people to tell the truth (as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">just remaining silent</a>) rather than just detect deception.
</p><p>In some situations, this becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> power.

This is because most people fidget, look away or do something else when they lie. So if a character is a Living Lie Detector, (s)he could just know what to look for. A police officer being able to tell when a witness is lying after years on the force is a common example of this.

A character may exploit a weakness of the detector: he does not detect "the" truth, but if the tested subject considers something to be true or not.

One being a baseline observation of the individual's behavior, someone who is naturally jittery means slight twitches don't really mean anything.

<ul><li> Nunnally Lamperouge/Princess Nunnally vi Britannia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, a blind young girl who has gained the ability to tell if someone's lying to her (presumably to being able to sense pulse rate, transpiration or body temperature changes), if she's touching their skin. Volume 4 of the <em>Code Geass R2</em> novel explains the origins of Nunnally's ability. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marianne conducted experiments with her own egg, giving Nunnally some powers derived from C.C. which allowed Nunnally to detect lies. The novel also reveals that it was Marianne's idea to blind Nunnally because Marianne had thought removing one of the five senses would strengthen Nunnally's ability, which Marianne determined wasn't powerful enough.</span> The R1 anime also has a few scenes that imply Nunnally's abilities aren't restricted to merely lie detection — she can seemingly sense Code Bearers. Or perhaps NOT sense, as it's a Geass-derived ability, that only C.C. and V.V. would be immune to, thus explaining why she mistakes one for the other. There's also that she detects Lelouch arriving in an earlier episode, well before he gets close enough to open the electric door.
</li><li> Kuga Yuuma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WorldTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WorldTrigger">World Trigger</a></em> inherited his father's ability to detect lies.
</li><li> The character Angel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YamiNoAegis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YamiNoAegis">Yami No Aegis</a></em> was born with a condition that means if anyone (including herself) lies, she will feel pain, even if the lie is small. Combined with her sad history, it's no wonder <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">she becomes bitter about humanity in general</a>.
</li><li> Holo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SpiceAndWolf">Spice and Wolf</a></em> claims that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEars">wolf ears</a> can tell if a person is lying or not most of the time. Given her lifespan and her inability to track down exactly what was being lied about in the first example, this is probably just a learned skill of knowing what to look for.
</li><li> Karin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> can notice someone's chakra being disturbed when they lie.
</li><li> Nodoka of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> becomes this with her pactio artifact <em>Diarium Ejus</em>. It manifests as a book that taps into the mind of her target with a great deal of detail, so long as she knows his/her identity.
<ul><li> This trope gets played for laughs briefly as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>: She tried to use the artifact on herself when she was thinking of an adequate situation to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> she was in. Turns out that her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryThemAll">desired solution</a> reinforces the fact that she is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert">Covert Pervert</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the advantages of Melody's powers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> is to detect lies with her supersensory hearing. If she hears your heartbeat go abnormal just a bit when you say anything, she can tell if you're lying or not.
<ul><li> Kurapika develops this ability with the Dowsing Chain.
</li><li> Kurapika's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> Senritsu possesses an <em>extremely</em> acute hearing sense, allowing to hear even the slightest changes of heartbeats. As a result, she is really useful when interrogating people. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It backfires horribly when she interrogates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Chrollo</a>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">lack of change in his heartbeat</a> drives the poor woman to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a></span>.
</li><li> Phantom Troupe member Pakunoda has her own unique way of determining if someone is lying to her by checking their memories through physical contact. Trying to trick her with a false memory won't work, because she always uses a loaded question to bring the true memory forth, meaning you either have to tell her the truth or legitimately not know the answer to her questions.
</li></ul></li><li> Some incarnations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> have this ability (though you couldn't really call him alive in any biological sense of the word).
</li><li> Joe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> was this due to his advanced soul perception. It's said to be the reason he broke up with Marie - he feared 'seeing through' her as his perception increased - and is likely why he worked with Shibusen's Internal Investigations. Highly likely Maka's own advanced soul perception will go this way.
</li><li> The main character of the manga <em>Kimi ga Uso o Tsuita</em> gains the ability to detect lying after she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">gets into a car accident</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>: This is only one of the reasons why Ranma Saotome thought Satori was annoying. It only made matters worse when Ranma realized that the kid was using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a> to get back at him, because he was upset over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Ranma and Akane's engagement.</a>
</li><li> Asashi Yuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IrisZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IrisZero">Iris Zero</a></em> sees a devil tail growing out each time someone is lying. Because people around her were doing this all the time, she isolated herself from the others. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Toru showed her that people can also lie not to hurt somebody or to protect their secrets. Thanks to his help Yuki opened herself up to the others once more.</span>
</li><li> Tsukimiya from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloodyCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloodyCross">Bloody Cross</a></em> can sense lies due to her being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dhampyr">half vampire half angel</a>.
</li><li> This is one of the powers Violet's Devil Fruit granted her in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>. Because she can see through people both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XRayVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XRayVision">literally</a> and figuratively, she can easily read people's minds and memories, making it obvious to her when a person is lying.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstructed</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan">Kotoura-san</a></em>'s Haruka—it's why she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">a social outcast</a>. Having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a> with a side order of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a> will do that.

He uses this to beat Jotaro and his team at various video games until they figure out the trick: his ability only works on yes-or-no questions. Jotaro manages to defeat him by having Joseph secretly reach into the game console with his Stand Hermit Purple and alter his inputs. Thus when D'Arby asks questions like "Are you going to throw a fastball?" Jotaro's soul might answer "Yes", but Joseph turns it into a curveball instead, completely frustrating D'Arby.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, thanks to her enchanted lasso, is probably one of the most well-known examples. The Lasso is able to force people to tell the truth, as mentioned above - it takes godlike willpower to prevent this, and the subject will not be able to lie, only avoid saying anything at all.
<ul><li> As she is the living embodiment of truth, being around Wonder Woman at all makes people slightly more truthful but this effect is easier to resist than being in contact with her lasso.
</li><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a> pointed out in her introduction to "The Circle" trade paperback, the lasso doesn't just make its captive <em>tell</em> the truth, it makes them <em>see and confront</em> the truth.
</li><li> Wonder Woman's creator, William Moulton Marston, also <em>basically invented the polygraph</em> ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LieDetector">Lie Detector</a>").

This is airbrushed out in almost all modern comics and screen adaptations, though some of them may retain "You will forget this interrogation ever happened" as a valid power.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">Wonder Woman (1942)</a></em>: While Marston's Wonder Woman was not considered an avatar of the truth, nor was the magic lasso yet the "Lasso of Truth", through her low level telepathy Diana was still usually aware of it when she was being lied to. If a villain was hiding their true nature and making benevolent claims, she could generally tell if their actual intent was nefarious.
</li><li> Wonder Woman's sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Troia</a> also has this ability, but in a lesser form.

Their power made someone fall so deeply in love (to the point of destroying whoever they may have been before) that they would obey whatever the Confessor asked of them. One of their chief duties is determining if someone sentenced to death really committed the crime.
<ul><li> Some sorceresses are shown to have that power. One of them is so eager to constantly say "Lie!", even about small things, that Richard mentions his friend must have had a very difficult time telling her his stories. Her response? "True."

And once you took it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">you couldn't get rid of it</a> unless someone voluntarily took it (though tricking someone into taking it worked) and it would always reveal the lies in every statement it heard, even lies of omission.

</li><li> In Sharon Shinn's books <em>The Safe-Keeper's Secret</em>, <em>The Truth-Teller's Tale</em>, and <em>The Dream-Maker's Magic</em>, Truth-Tellers can detect lies <em>and</em> tell if a statement is objectively true, but are also incapable of lying themselves (to be fair, they tend to be honest by nature and not inclined to lie even if they could). At least once, a Truth-Teller stumbles on information — that her friend's brother, presumed drowned, is alive — by absentmindedly saying it and realizing that if she can say it, it must be true.

(Not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> intelligence contributes to this)

If a wizard looks into the eyes of someone particularly evil, it can scar him for life. However, it doesn't necessarily tell you whether they did something, but simply gives an impression of what sorts of things they're capable of. It also only works once, so the information gathered is not necessarily going to be up to date.
<ul><li> Although the soulgaze allows the <em>other person</em> to look into the Wizards soul just as easily. Even for a nice guy like Harry, seeing the depths of his soul is horribly disturbing, even to Muggles who can't process exactly why. Wizards have a particularly difficult skill of being able to look people in the face without actually making eye contact to avoid accidentally setting it off.
</li><li> Also, in <em>Changes</em>, Dresden meets an FBI agent named Tilly, who can do this.

<ul><li> Force-sensitives have some insight on the emotional states of the people to whom they are speaking. They can feel when someone flinches or has an emotional reaction, even when those are carefully hidden. However, they have more trouble when the person they're speaking to is of an unfamiliar alien species, and it's <em>very</em> hard to tell if someone with a massive degree of self-control is lying. This is used the most in '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurvivorsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurvivorsQuest">Survivor's Quest</a>'', during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> in the first third of the book, when everyone is hiding something.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsAllegiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsAllegiance">Star Wars: Allegiance</a></em>, where the pirate leader called the Commodore floats in a pool with his eyes covered, the better to focus on the voice of his guest. He believes that doing this, damping down all of his senses but hearing, makes him more able to tell if he's being lied to and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeByAnalysis">pick out hidden things about the speaker</a>. But he's trying to gauge Mara Jade, who is able to subtly stir the air and water to interfere with his senses without his knowing, and so he misses the fact that she's an Imperial agent sent to find connections between these pirates and corrupt officials.
</li><li> Gotals are a goat-like species with conical horns on their heads that allow them to sense electromagnetic fields, including those emitted by living creatures' neural networks. This makes them natural bounty hunters and diplomats, as they're not only able to detect their quarry, but sense subtle emotional changes that indicate someone's lying. It's not foolproof, though—in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Wedge's Gamble</a></em>, Gavin Darklighter is nearly executed as a bigot after a Gotal sensed his relief that a Bothan woman stopped hitting on him at a bar. What he was mainly worried about was drawing attention to the rest of Rogue Squadron during a covert operation on the Imperial capital, and also he's just shy.
</li><li> Lorrdians are a race of humans who have developed a sophisticated language of signs and subtle face and body movements, due to their history of being slaves forbidden to speak. Many Lorrdians, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsRazorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsRazorsEdge">Razor's Edge</a></em>, Arak tukor Viest, can read truth and lies, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">other aspects of a person</a>, off of his or her face and body.

As a result, the protagonist has a habit of telling the strict literal truth where possible.
<ul><li> A very, very small number of werewolves learn how to tell lies to other werewolves: the trick is to convince yourself that you aren't lying, to buy into your own propaganda. Those few who figure it out keep the secret under heavy wraps, so as not to ruin the game for everyone.

Some mages who can do it are employed as "truthsayers" by courts and law enforcement (districts that can't afford one or an artifact equivalent use the old standby, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a>).

</li><li> The Trout Of Truth in the <em>Monster Hunters</em> series has this ability, and will eat (and then spit out) anyone who lies in its presence. Very unusually, it sense not whether the subject <em>believes</em> what they're saying is true, but whether it actually <em>is</em> true. This leads to its use as a way to sort out new Hunter cadets into Banishers and Nethermancers. You stand on the shore of the Lake, shout out "I am a Banisher!". If the monster eats you, you're a Nethermancer. If it doesn't, you're a Banisher.

However, this is ultimately deconstructed, because the spider-priests ability doesn't actually detect <em>truth</em>, just <em>certainty</em>; you can utter falsehoods to one of the priests all you want and so long as you <em>believe</em> it to be true, the priests' powers won't detect it. Furthermore, they're not immune to their own Compelling Voices, and so over time come to believe their own opinions represent objective truth. If you say something that goes against a spider-priest's beliefs, but genuinely believe it to be the truth, they'll be psychologically unable to reconcile the situation and will fly into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">an irrational berserk rage</a>.

It does have drawbacks, such as lies of omission, and non-verbal communication.
</li><li> <em>Lie To Me</em> by David Martin: A detective can always tell if someone is lying. He goes to investigate a reported suicide, and doesn't doubt that it was suicide, but is certain that the dead man's young wife is lying when she says that she doesn't know why he did it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The dead man took it badly when his wife told him that she was his long-lost daughter.</span>

They can hear it from the person's voice - the main character Byx describes hearing a lie as being like hearing a cat barking. In the story, she's been declared the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">last of her kind</a>, which would make her ability extremely useful to anyone who would take advantage of her. It's complicated, however, by the fact that her species has been declared extinct. Also, because dairnes can detect lies, some believe that they themselves are incapable of it. This is false, though it's true that they don't lie among their own kind, as it would be pointless, and thus aren't in the habit of it.
</li><li> This is, essentially, the role played in courts by ghatti in the <em>Ghatti's Tale</em> series. They actually had some difficultly understanding the concept of a lie at first, as they are incapable of lying, most likely for the same reason as the Clan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthsChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EarthsChildren">Earth's Children</a></em>, namely, they have a gestural language, in which lying would be impossible.

As Buffy says at one point, "I can't fool myself. Or Spike, apparently." Later on he easily sees through Willow's pretence that she is coping after Oz leaves. And he accuses Buffy (and, by extension, all Slayers) of having a secret death wish in season five.

While that's useful as a lie detector, as always context is everything. For instance in "The Self-Preservation Society", Homelander cites Starlight's accelerated heartrate as proof of her guilt but she's just terrified, as anyone would be if a psycho with superpowers was shouting in their face.
</li><li> Kiera Cameron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Continuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Continuum">Continuum</a></em> can detect lies though in a sense her ability works more like a traditional lie detector. The combination of the CMR computer chip in her brain and the cameras in her eyes read respiration, heart rate, body temperature changes, etc. and tell her when someone's reactions are abnormal. This means that she can nearly always tell when someone is lying (or even just withholding information) but she doesn't exactly know what the truth is or what information is being withheld.

<ul><li> Plus there was the lobster-like creature that could detect "cognitive dissonance". Fortunately John Crichton was able to fool it by sending his identical clone, who was able to truthfully say that he hadn't been running around doing things the local Ruler didn't approve of.
</li><li> Scarrans have this ability too (Scorpius is half-Scarran), though it appears to be based more on actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a> than ES reading.

</li><li> He can also only compare what the person is saying to what they're thinking. While that is enough to tell a liar in most cases, Noah Bennet once managed to trick him by <em>thinking</em> something that wasn't true.
</li><li> Sue Landers, a minor character and office worker, is revealed to have the power to tell when someone is lying. Unfortunately, it's revealed because Sylar is standing in her office, lying about why he has come to see her. He kills her and touches her brain, thus absorbing her lie-detection ability; unlike Matt, though, he can't dig around in the person's head for the truth. Ironically, Sylar's known to lie his way out of situations, but gets violent when discovering that he's being lied to.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LieToMe">Lie to Me</a></em> is about a behavioral scientist who studies facial expressions, body language, and so on to determine if people are lying. The rest of the main cast uses the same science, and one is a "natural" who can do it without training. The show is based on the work of real life psychologist Paul Ekman, but its accuracy and usefulness is exaggerated for the sake of fiction. Ekman advises using a high-speed video camera to detect microexpressions (as they last fractions of a second) and notes other explanations for microexpressions, whereas characters in <em>Lie to Me</em> almost always detect them with the naked eye and rarely address explanations other than lying.
<ul><li> One episode has Lightman speak to a college class about his research. When one student manages to fool him, Lightman immediately declares him a sociopath and does his best to prove that the guy is a serial killer. At the end, the guy is holding him at gunpoint and points out that he wouldn't have done anything if Lightman had not hounded him.

Monk then discovers that Marty is actually faking it: he knew about it all along as his mother, a quality control operator, overheard Dial and his partner Vic Blanchard talk about the crime while on hold to buy plane tickets, and fed all the information to Marty.

Bra'tac does it again later when the Jaffa council was being subverted by Ba'al, though it took him a bit longer.

</li><li> Jesus displayed a similar ability in his encounter with the woman at the well, although this one is more open to interpretation. When questioned about her marital status, the woman replies "I have no husband"; she's lying, as she's been married several times and is currently wed, but Jesus, who knows she's speaking falsely, tells her that she unknowingly spoke the truth — the laws of that region stated that divorce was impossible, so technically, she doesn't have a husband as she's not living with the first man she married. Unlike the above example, Jesus does not punish the woman, and she rushes back to town to tell everyone about her conversation; some Biblical scholars have argued that this makes her the first Christian evangelist.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Scott Adams, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em>, claims his training in being a hypnotist gives him the ability to tell when most people are lying. Along with complete mastery of persuasion. According to his blog he tried to tell them that when he was called for jury duty, and they patiently explained to him that <em>that's not how that works</em>.
</li><li> According to Malcolm Gladwell's book <em>Blink</em>, a particular scientist was not just a Living Lie Detector but could discern things about a society just by looking at the facial expressions of various members for a few seconds. The book claims (and while Gladwell's science is often erroneous in the book, the individual anecdotes themselves are usually true) that he was able to do so by understanding micro-tics, twitches of facial muscles that everyone sees but doesn't interpret because they go too quickly.
<ul><li> He's probably referring to Dr. Ekman who, in fact, advises the use of a high speed video camera (microexpressions lasts less than a second) and says that everything else should be ruled out before deciding that a statement is a lie.
</li><li> The same book also had an anecdote about a different psychologist who created a computer program that uses data from a fifteen-minute conversation between a couple to tell whether or not they'll still be together in fifteen years. The accuracy? 80%.
</li></ul></li><li> There are classes that teach you what people do when they lie. So they're being taught how to become a living lie-detector. Unfortunately, most people are only slightly better than chance at determining truth from falsehoods. Since most judgments never go challenged, people also tend to think of themselves as much better at detecting lies than they actually are. Police, citizens, and a coin all scored close enough to each other to not be considered statistically significant despite the officers having had training.
</li><li> The problem with this trope in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> is that although you can tell what emotion a person is feeling by looking at the body language, you can't tell why they are feeling it. A person who is showing signs of fear may be afraid you'll see through the lie, afraid you'll think they are lying when they aren't, or afraid they left the stove on.
<ul><li> Also, this often does not help you distinguish what is fact from what is <em>believed</em> to be fact. When your body language tells "truth", it merely confirm the person's <em>belief</em> in that statement, not its factual veracity. A die-hard Flat-Earth theorist could swear to the Earth being flat with his last breath and no lie detector, living or otherwise, would ever so much as twitch.
</li><li> Then there's the matter of people whose body language and/or emotional responses don't fit the human norm, e.g people with a variety of personality and/or mental disorders.
</li><li> For that matter, classes on how to fake these things are available in most schools. They call it "acting".
</li></ul></li><li> Humanity as a whole. It is thought that what allowed humans to form larger social groups and establish trade for mutual advantage ages ago when other primates just as intelligent were inherently distrustful, is that humans were good at telling who to trust and who not to trust allowing them to trust strangers from other human groups.
</li><li> Inversion and subversion: in 1993, then president Bill Clinton called up KMOX radio in St. Louis and said on the air "after I get off the phone with you today, Rush Limbaugh will come on and will have three hours to say whatever he wants and I won't be able to defend myself. There's no truth detector." Limbaugh countered: "We need no truth detector. I <em>am</em> the truth detector." Subverted in that at least two books have been published consisting almost entirely of listing things Rush Limbaugh has said and then contrasting those statements with the contrary actual facts.
</li><li> Here's a tip: if you want to tell if someone is lying, look at their eyes. If they glance away just before, during or directly after a statement there's a chance they're lying. Liars have trouble looking their interrogators in the face and will try and divert their gaze when they can. This is harder with women (who tend to be more socially adept than men) and easier with children (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">who are obviously more naïve and inexperienced than adults</a>). But it can backfire too — many people are aware of this test, and will therefore make absolutely sure to look their questioner right in the face. Of course, if they suddenly stare directly after a conversation of only occasional glances, that's a giveaway as well. As with a polygraph test, the thing you're really looking for is a sudden change. And anyone with a form of autism has trouble with eye contact in general, so it won't work on them. Plus eye contact is considered rude or aggressive in many cultures, so they might just be uncomfortable.
