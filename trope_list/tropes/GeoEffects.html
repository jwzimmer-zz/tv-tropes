</li><li> In the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal">Blade of the Immortal</a></em>, Magatsu's main schtick is taking advantage of his surroundings to overcome his (usually more dangerous) opponents. An early quote of his is "He who controls the land can conquer Heaven."
</li><li> Likewise for Serpico in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> manga, who tends to attack his opponents on specifically chosen ground that works in his favor. For example, he chooses to ambush Guts (who could cut Serpico in half in a second on an open battlefield) on a cliffside where Guts doesn't have room to swing or even draw his BFS, has very precarious footing and the morning sun in his eyes.
<ul><li> Serpico does this again in a second battle with Guts, choosing a room filled with pillars to stop his large sword. Guts cuts through them anyways.
</li></ul></li><li> Lelouch does this pretty regularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> - it's the finishing touch on a maneuver that would have won the war no problems if he hadn't been called away, and is so successful that he does it again in the second series. His preferred tactic is luring enemies into position and then causing structural damage on the battlefield to collapse the ground under the enemy units, or crush them with debris from above.
<ul><li> Nothing's stopping his enemy du jour Xingke to use it on him. In a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a>, Lelouch thought about drying the dam before the fight. Unfortunately, the water that is left certainly couldn't flood his army off, but it did make the soil muddy and sticky, reducing them to easy pickings.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Duelist Kingdom arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, this is used for certain battles: Water monsters placed over the sea or bug cards in the forest gained attack and defense points. In the French translation of the manga, this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">hilariously translated</a> as "Field Power Sauce".
<ul><li> This eventually became the basis of Field Spell Cards in both the anime and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">Tabletop Games</a>, which give certain monsters (usually ones of a certain Attribute, Monster Type, or Monster Archetype/Name Group) bonuses, regardless of who controls them, and go into their own unique card zone.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Hollows and Arrancar are much more powerful when fighting in Hueco Mundo because there is a much higher concentration of spirit energy in the air than in the real world.
<ul><li> Uryu and Chad also get a boost for the same reason (the latter moreso because of the particular type of spirit energy and the nature of his powers).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Holyland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Holyland">Holyland</a></em> mentions how judo and other wrestling or grappling styles can be very effective on the street because getting thrown or taken to ground on concrete or asphalt is a very different - read: more painful - beast from falling on the mat in training or competition. Also, being on soft ground like grass allows the wrestler Tsuchiya to go all out without fear of hurting himself from a whiff.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnlineAlternativeGunGaleOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SwordArtOnlineAlternativeGunGaleOnline">Sword Art Online: Alternative Gun Gale Online</a></em> LLENN achieves this by accident: she made her gear pink because she wanted a cute avatar, but eventually discovered that her choice of armor color also makes for excellent camouflage in the desert, giving her a big advantage over opponents by allowing her to ambush them with ease.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> by Pantyhose Taro.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> is all over this, being about tactical tank-on-tank combat.
</li><li> The environments and surroundings was a big factor in battle during the first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em>, as Kira would have to numerous opponents in machines adapted for the current landtype or space, and he would need to adjust his Operating System to do the same.

The first day both sides fear the other will march on the high ground (the Union did). The second day is the CMOA defense of Little Round Top. The third day they talk about the Union artillery on the high ground commanding the battlefield.
<div class="indent"><strong>Buford</strong>: When our people arrive, Lee'll have high ground. There'll be the devil to pay.
</div><ul><li> The Union had the high ground at the very start of the battle, but did not possess the strength to defend it. Buford's choice was to defend a position three hills <em>in front</em> of the best ground on the field, so that when he was inevitably driven back, he would reform on the next hill in the line and fight again. It's a delaying tactic known as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth">defense in depth<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> In the Warhammer 40000 Ultramarines novel <em>Nightbringer,</em> a PDF company has the high ground, which initially is considered an advantage in their favor.

Unfortunately for them, they turned out to be wrong about it on several levels, and when they put it into practice, Aram's armies were defeated once again.
<div class="indent"><strong>1 Kings 20:23</strong>: Meanwhile, the officials of the king of Aram advised him, "Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were too strong for us. But if we fight them on the plains, surely we will be stronger than they."
</div><ul><li> This HAS proven to be good strategic advice for several enemies of Israel. The Israelis of the time had a decent grasp of guerrilla tactics, but no way to counter chariot charges—except for fighting in places where chariots were ineffective.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Judges 1:19</strong> And the LORD was with Judah; and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.
<ul><li> They did go on to defeat the people in the valley, iron chariots included, in chapter four. Their earlier loss was because they weren't right with God.
</li></ul></div><ul><li> Israelites were also notoriously poor sailors and considered falling into the sea to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">instant death</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In addition to the standard terrain tactics, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedStormRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedStormRising">Red Storm Rising</a></em> features a rare seaborne variant for the NATO amphibious fleet off Iceland, which causes navigational nightmares when it stages its landing in a rock-filled harbor.

Additionally, there's the ground-rule double, which treats the ball being hit into a certain feature of the field as being a double (i.e., the batter and any baserunners on base are permitted to advance two bases). These include:

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeoEffects">Geo Effects</a> basically originate in tabletop and miniatures wargaming. The cardboard chit and hexmap wargames of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AvalonHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AvalonHill">Avalon Hill</a>, SPI, and others had movement penalties and defensive bonuses for woods, hills, rivers, cities, and so on.
</li><li> Owing to its origins as a tactical wargame simulator, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has cover, concealment, and various modifiers based on terrain, varied in different editions.
<ul><li> <em>Player's Options: Combat and Tactics</em> provided more detailed model for tactics, so it considered more terrain effects than core AD&amp;D.
</li><li> The Horizon Walker from 3rd Edition gets "insight bonuses" to various things when he's on a terrain he's previously mastered.
</li><li> An optional class feature for the ranger class introduced in the 3rd edition sourcebook <em>Unearthed Arcana</em> was "favored environment", which did the same thing as the horizon walker's ability. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>, this became a standard ability for all rangers.
</li></ul></li><li> Based on <em>D&amp;D</em>'s <em>Unearthed Arcana</em>, "favored environment" was brought in as a buyable feat for anyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em>, although the bonus is capped as with all other bonuses, meaning that a character with it is just as good as everyone else in their given terrain, but a bit worse everywhere else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has a class of creature abilities collectively known as "landwalk", which makes a creature with it unblockable if the other player has a land of that type (plainswalk, forestwalk, etc.). There are also some creatures that can't attack unless the opponent had an appropriate land type (like <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?id=129719">Sea Monster<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), but this is much less common. There are some other spells that may fall under this, like <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?id=13191">Familiar Ground<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Because what land a player controls determines what kind of mana he has access to, abilities that only work if the player controls certain kinds of land are often used as a proxy for an actual mana cost, such as in <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=159067">the Hedge-Mages<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <em>Eventide</em> and Naya's <a class="urllink" href="http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/CardDetails.aspx?&amp;id=174989">Wild Nacatl<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Given that lands are the basic resource that fuels all your spells, you could say the <em>entire game</em> centers around controlling the right terrain.
</li><li> The Planechase game mode uses Planes which apply a global effect to all players. Naturally, different environments benefit various decks differently, and players have the ability to roll the planar die for a chance to switch to a different random plane... or trigger a spectacular effect tied to the plane itself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, units get 'cover saves' for being in cover, either in area terrain or behind obstructions that partially block the enemy's line of fire. In addition, most units and vehicles are impeded when moving through certain types of terrain, with a rare few special units that are unaffected.
<ul><li> Also, both the Kroot and the Catachan jungle fighters get extra bonuses when fighting in a jungle or forest terrain.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> units in cover are harder to hit, and ranged units may fire in two ranks if they are at a higher elevation than the target.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, terrain is one of the main factors in battle. Most all cover hinders line-of-sight, and in cases involving a series of mountains or valleys between two combatants, advanced rules explain how to draw a graph to simulate whether or not line of sight is present.
<ul><li> Terrain restrictions also play a part. For instance, being actually in a woods hex instead of just behind it lets a unit enjoy those woods' defensive benefits without being hindered by them in turn, but not all units can actually <em>enter</em> woods. Part of what makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">BattleMechs</a> "kings of the battlefield" is, in fact, their ability to handle virtually every kind of terrain the game has to offer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> has cover, cover DR, concealment, visibility, attack from above/below, g-force gradients etc. Even the effects of fog on the damage done by laser weapons have official stats.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroScape">Hero Scape</a></em>, height advantages are a major part of combat, and one character being just one level higher than another can make a <em>huge</em> difference. Some units, like the Dumutef Gaurd and Marro Drudges, also get special bonuses in a certain kind of terrain.
</li><li> The old hexmap-and-cardboard-chits wargames of the 1960s-80s by Avalon Hill and SPI have rules for improved defense by woods, mountains, rivers, road movement, and so on.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTop/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTop/YuGiOh">Yu Gi Oh</a></em> has Field Cards, cards that effect the entire field. There are series of cards that will power up various types of monsters (Such as Umi for Fish, Sea-Serpent, Aqua and Thunder Monsters) but since cards don't typically stay on the field very long in the current metagame, Field Cards with more than just attack power ups are typically preferred, such as The Sanctuary in the Sky, which keeps a player from taking damage when their Fairy type monsters are attacked.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a></em>, some terrains provide better cover than others, and many characters are more effective in certain terrain. For example, Kindle has higher attack in cities, while Koal operates better than others on roads. Terrain bonuses are increased with Lash, Jake has the edge on plains, etc. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherOfWar">Weather works similarly</a>. Everybody has much lower mobility in the snow, except for Olaf, whose attack, defense, and mobility are all increased. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a> puts everyone in a bad situation but Sonja, as well. Finally, bonuses of this type (such as stronger attack on the sea) can be given to any character with the abilities system used in <em>Dual Strike</em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires">Age of Empires</a></em> series takes into account cliffs (projectiles are more lethal if fired from the top), high ground (same), makes units slower when going uphill and faster when going downhill, and allows units to take cover in some buildings like town centers and castles (which, if they are villagers or archers, will boost the building's attack against the enemy).
<ul><li> In some campaign scenarios of <em>III</em>, units' health will decrease from the cold and only recover after taking shelter in a cave or near a fire.
</li><li> <em>Imperium III</em> reduces the health of units and eventually kills them unless they are routinely provided with food wagons. In the Egypt scenario, several places in the Nile Delta carry malaria and will also damage your troops if you march them through there, and keep damaging them after.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfMythology">Age of Mythology</a></em> expansion <em>The Titans</em>, choosing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasRevenge">Gaia</a> causes "lush terrain" to grow around your buildings, which provides a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buff</a> to your units fighting in it.
</li><li> Terrain is a major strategic consideration in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientEmpires">Ancient Empires</a></em>, affecting movement and defence. Bare ground and wooden bridges have no effects, grass/snow slightly increases defence, forest and hills moderately increase defence but also slightly reduce movement, mountains greatly increase defence and reduce movement, water greatly reduces movement (except for amphibious or flying units), and buildings greatly increase defence and (if an allied building) heal units each turn.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWonders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWonders">Age of Wonders</a></em> (at least second and third) games unit standing higher/lower than target gets to-hit bonus/penalty for ranged attacks. But sometimes standing behind elevation may be safer due to miss chance for cover. Also, different attack abilities use different trajectories, so catapult can lob stones at ballista while completely shielded from its javelins.
<ul><li> Also, if playing for the elves, it is better to build your city in a wooded area and then add a structure that hides the entire city from the enemy. The only way to find it is by dumb luck or by looking if any roads are leading to it. You can build a dozen cities in the enemy's backyard, and they wouldn't even know it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Archon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Archon">Archon</a></em> is (partly) a virtual board game version of this trope. In the original version and <em>Archon Ultra</em>, light-side pieces are stronger on white squares, dark-side pieces are stronger on black squares, and on top of that, about a third of the tiles on the board cycle back and forth between white, black, and shades of gray. <em>Archon Ultra</em> spiced things up further in the real-time combat sequences - swamps on a gray square would slow down non-flyers, lava would injure most units, and if you were fighting for a power point, you could park yourself over the power point to regain health.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BahamutLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BahamutLagoon">Bahamut Lagoon</a></em> loves this. Structures heal, swamps and spikes hurt, and a ton of stuff slows the characters down. And they all be affected by the right element.
</li><li> This is one of the major factors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth">Battle for Wesnoth</a></em>, which has varying defensive bonuses and movement rates for each unit type on each terrain type. Elves are best deployed in forests, merfolk really have no business being out of the water, and may the Gods help you if you try to fight a dwarf on a mountain tile!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> has a host of various terrains with positive and negative effects for either moving through or being in a space with that particular terrain under your 'Mech. For instance, Swamp terrain decreases your movement speed, but to compensate you take less stability damage from missiles and ballistic weapons. Being in a forest or sand cyclone gives you partial cover, but also prevents you from scouting as efficiently by reducing your line-of-sight. Some terrain is universally positive (high ground in general, ice) while some terrain is universally negative (rough terrain, lava). Managing the battlefield you're on and knowing how to control the various terrains is a large part of doing well in the game.
</li><li> Using the high ground in <em>Blitzkrieg</em> is a very good strategy. First, units on top of a cliff can attack units below without being seen. Second, to be attacked, an attacker would have to circle around the cliff and come up the back. The only drawback is cliffs are such obvious places to base ambushes from, the enemy can respond to this by shelling the area with artillery fire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Brigandine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Brigandine">Brigandine</a></em> has a few such effects, including better defense in the forest (IIRC), but the powerhouse placement is during sea battles... especially one in which the ocean tiles take up almost the entire map, and the land units are restricted to a couple small connected islands. On ocean tiles, water-class creatures can heal over time, have boosted stats (again, IIRC), and can make use of some abilities that they can't make use of on land. You do <em>not</em> want to be sitting next to a Hydra unit who's found a piece of water to camp on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em>:
<ul><li> Since the first game, certain terrain types slowed down units and granted defensive bonuses, and of course strategic resources like oil or luxuries like silk can only appear on certain types of tiles. <em>Civ IV</em> introduced the notion of unit promotions, allowing veteran units to gain bonuses when fighting in hills, or negating the penalty for attacking across a river. And depending on the game, some units like chariots or catapults cannot enter terrain like jungles or hills unless there's a road built through them.
</li><li> The similar <em>Colonization</em> made terrain types about the most important factor in building a colony. To simulate the asymmetrical warfare of the American War of Independence, in <em>Colonization</em> the player's units are all much weaker than the regulars and cavalry of the expeditionary force sent by the King, but they gain large terrain-related bonuses, while the European troops have difficulty fighting in the wild frontier of the American continent. This forces the player to get his units out of his cities and fight a terrain-conscious guerilla war, which is different from what fighting a defensive war in a Civilization game is like.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em> has a whole bunch of terrain modifiers. Xenofungus makes Mind Worms faster and stronger; on the other hand, ground units moving through xenofungus become painfully slow. Rover units get an attack bonus on open ground. Infantry get one when attacking a base. Artillery gets one when on higher ground. Bases get more or less rainfall depending on which side of a mountain you put them on... the list goes on. Terraforming units ("Formers") can construct a whole bunch of additional structures to give squares extra bonuses (or remove their penalties).
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> games, units that are on higher terrain tend to be harder for enemies to hit, although the exact percentage this is isn't revealed in the game or manual. It can be a source of annoyance, though, as sometimes putting a unit or defensive structure by what looks like a small enough rock or some other terrain feature renders it blind to attacks coming from that direction since the programming of game has said feature be tall enough to be a blind spot, visuals be damned.
<ul><li> In <em>Tiberian Sun</em>, GDI has amphibious units that can attack on land and then retreat to water, while Nod has burrowing units whose advantage lies in being able to bypass terrain completely for sneak attacks.
</li><li> Likewise again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAlert">Red Alert</a> 3</em> where each faction has at least two amphibious units and practically all mobile structures are amphibious as well; the Empire of the Rising Sun's virtual entire military force is amphibious in some form or another.
</li></ul></li><li> Infantry in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CompanyOfHeroes">Company of Heroes</a></em> use the "cover dots" system. Any place chosen as a destination is rated for the cover it provides, indicated by a colored dot. As in real ranged warfare, it's absolutely vital.
</li><li> Dave from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CosmicStarHeroine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CosmicStarHeroine">Cosmic Star Heroine</a></em> has a skill "Envirohack" which effects an effect that depends on the area you're in, such as healing your party in jungles of Rhomu, poisoning enemies on dirty streets of Araenu or electrifying them inside high-tech facilities.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em>, one disadvantage of using an Ultra Greatsword is that it's just too big to wield in confined spaces. The Royal Rat Vanguard and his pack of rats' boss arena is full of unbreakable statues that deflect your attacks. In addition, getting wet (walking through water, standing in rain, breaking water-filled jars) will reduce your lightning resistance while increasing your resistance to fire effects. Similarly, in some places you can be covered with tar or pitch, which will make you burst into flame if you come in contact with fire... like the torch you might happen to be carrying.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em>, you can use the Geo Effects to your advantage. The effects range from stat boosts to making evil clones of your team to kill every round to outright invulnerability. You can also destroy the Geo Effects, and doing so will change the colors of the squares they're on to match the destroyed Effect, or destroy the squares if it's a Null. Setting up a chain that destroys all the Geo Panels will injure every enemy onscreen and earn you a massive bonus at the fight's end.
<ul><li> Geo effects also appear in the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponIchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NipponIchi">Nippon Ichi</a> tactical RPGs, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LaPucelle">La Pucelle Tactics</a>,</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a>,</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulNomadAndTheWorldEaters">Soul Nomad &amp; the World Eaters</a></em>.
</li><li> The Geo Effects get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsYourPremiseOnDrugs">pumped up with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">eleven drugs</a> in the Item World, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">where it is piss-easy to set up a combo that wipes out all enemies and maxes out the bonus gauge.</a>
<ul><li> At least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">sometimes</a>. The main difference from plot maps is the randomness - plot maps are either set up for an easy chain, or an impossible chain. Item world maps average on being possible, but still requiring a lot of movement, with easy chains or useless short chains being the extremes.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DivinityOriginalSin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DivinityOriginalSin">Divinity: Original Sin</a></em>, player and enemies are all affected by terrain. Be it via a spell (like Midnight Oil) or natural, its effects will affect every unit. Both can also interact with the terrain condition using spells or scrolls. A puddle of water could be turned into a static cloud if one were to use a lightning spell on it, whereas using a fire spell on an oil puddle will set it ablaze, damaging units that stand in the fire.
</li><li> Placing enough terrain block tiles in an area of The Isle of Awakening in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a></em> will change the terrain shown on the minimap. This has a function other than looks: It also changes what type of monsters will spawn on those tiles. This can be used for getting resources.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalSonata">Eternal Sonata</a></em> has this in the form of it's light and dark battle system. Standing in a lighted portion of the arena gave you access to different special attacks than when standing in shaded portions, and some enemies changes forms when moving between light and dark areas.
</li><li> As the name implies, the Geomancers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> are based entirely around this.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> allows the weather to affect spells. It's most apparent in Dynamis or Limbus, where double dark weather can cause 400+ HP healing Cure 4's to get cut down to about 310...
<ul><li> The day of the week and the moon phase can also affect spells. Especially notable in that, during a full moon, a certain werewolf boss can singlehandedly fend off <em>30 players and over 40 allied NPCs</em> (which are actually stronger and last longer than players in this game) while not breaking a sweat, due to being able to fully heal every few seconds. This turns campaign battles into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckBasedMission">Luck-Based Mission</a> in the San d'Oria areas, because an attack by the werewolf squad is either a moderately easy win or a nearly guaranteed loss depending on the moon phase.
</li></ul></li><li> The battle grids of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> include elevation. Furthermore, weather affects some elemental attributes: if it's raining, use Thunder spells (which do more damage) rather than Fire spells (which do less). If it's snowing, use Blizzard spells for a similar boost. Further furthermore, weather can grant penalties for moving through already-rough terrain, namely slogging through swamps in the rain.
<ul><li> Furthermore one class, the Geomancer, actually had an attack that was different depending on what terrain he or she was standing on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsA2">Final Fantasy Tactics A2</a></em> also has its own version of Geomancer. Not only the terrain type, but the weather also influences what they can do.
</li><li> Elevation has a very large effect on common magic, summoning, and ranged attacks. Crossbows, while having higher damage than bows, have a range limit. Bows receive better range the higher you are, but fire in an arc. A limit to the height difference between where one is standing and their target is a given with most spells. The game has <em>many</em> less obvious ways to turn things to your advantage. This is before glitches or a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> are added to the mix...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> doesn't deal with weather, but the elevation of certain locations can be a real problem depending on where you are. There are some battlegrounds where all the opponents are at the top of a mountain, and you're stuck at the bottom, out of range for nearly everything, even with magic and ranged attacks.
</li><li> Not as much of a problem if you had the right skills. Jump has the same accuracy regardless of your height (but sadly nerfed in the later games for no reason). A lot of your weapons don't work but combos never miss. Illusion magic is also quite powerful (especially when combined with Magic frenzy in later games) with Totemas rounding it out. You always can use Assassins that are fast enough to always go first and can have their movement range increased. With the right skills, Assassins can evade and kill everything in the first game (but sadly, not the second).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>, the weather in a given area can affect the effectiveness of certain weapons and spells. During rainy weather, for example, bows and crossbows are less accurate, while thunder and water spells do more damage and fire does less.
</li><li> Mog of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> is based around this. But his Dance ability, instead of conforming to the local environment, simply <em>changes</em> the background to the relevant one. ie: You're fighting in a cave? Mog wants to fight underwater. ...and now you are. There is a failure chance for these background changes, so there's an advantage for using the dance native to the current terrain, which will always succeed.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>, units receive defensive bonuses for standing on terrain features like forests, towns, and mountains.
<ul><li> The final levels of <em>FE 10</em> has <em>only</em> effectual cover terrain—some that gives mad defense bonuses, some that give mad evasion bonuses, and some that <em>increase magic resistance</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the <a class="urllink" href="http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Vein">Dragon Veins<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: the characters with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicLineage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicLineage">Heroic Lineage</a> (like the Avatar, the Royal Siblings, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their children</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> those without Royal Blood but who have consumed the <a class="urllink" href="http://fireemblem.wikia.com/wiki/First_Blood">First Blood<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> item., <em>and</em> their kids whose other parent isn't a Royal either, as long as the kid's recruited after the FB was consumed</span>) are capable of using some specially marked parts of the maps to alter the outcome of the battle, as effects vary from creating new paths, drying up rivers to create more terrain, creating regeneration spots, freezing enemies, or consuming their weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freelancer">Freelancer</a></em> backstory, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower">Gas Mining Guild</a> managed to defeat the <em>entire Rheinland military</em> by using their knowledge of their home <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClouds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceClouds">nebula</a> against the Rheinlanders. The nebula's explosive gas pockets took out more Imperial ships than the GMG itself did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FrontMission">Front Mission</a></em> does this with terrains. There are three leg types (bipeds, quads, hovers), and each goes with inverse suitability in terms of terrain navigation vs. jumping ability (eg, bipeds suck at navigating swamps but can jump to top of buildings etc.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GadgetTrial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GadgetTrial">Gadget Trial</a></em> has similar effects with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Advance Wars</a></em> above, but with the addition that air units also receives terrain defense bonus.

Foot units is advantageous in most ground terrain and marine units are very strong in water. Castles, summoning circles and mana crystals give defensive bonuses to most units.
</li><li> In the Elemental Lighthouses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> and its sequel, any party member who matches the lighthouse's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">element</a> will recover some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">PP</a> at the end of each turn in battle.
</li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GroundControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GroundControl">Ground Control</a></em> and more so in its sequel, where certain icons light up to tell you if you have extra cover provided by trees or buildings. Additionally, ground vehicles in the first game have weaker armor on top, meaning units firing on them from a higher elevation do extra damage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></em> has something like this, as different troops have different native terrains and have no penalty when moving on them.
<ul><li> The third game of the series, troops actually have <em>an extra</em> movement point on their native terrain, in battles. As movement also decides in what succession the units get their turn, this can be crucial even in the late game, because somehow it seems as if <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightMakesMight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightMakesMight">Angels are just one point faster than devils</a></em>, and other such ridicules.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>, there's the concept of "brush" or "bush", which are patches of vegetation that confer invisibility. And a few characters can also fiddle with the ground itself, to hinder opponents, benefit themselves or both. The prime example of this is Trundle the Troll King, who can freeze the ground in a targeted area which gives him massive movement speed and attack speed buffs as well as bonus health regeneration when he stands in it. He can also summon a pillar of ice on a target area, which blocks the area and slows units around it, as well as disrupting the movement of enemies standing on the area the tower is placed at. This makes Trundle exceptionally deadly to fight in tightly enclosed areas as he can completely block of access points and makes getting away from his frozen domain incredibly difficult.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfMana">Legend of Mana</a></em>, each Artifact has an inherent mana level that spills over to its neighbors when planted onto the map. Good luck figuring out what this actually means for gameplay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">without a walkthrough</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Majesty">Majesty</a></em> spinoff (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfMagic">Master of Magic</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a>) <em>Warlock: Master of the Arcane</em>, the environment of the normal plane has all the usual effects - being in a forest grants you a defensive bonus, unless you're fighting wild beasts. Attacking uphill gives you a penalty. Walking across either slows you down. However, the environment is far more important to your cities' production - desert terrain is best for producing Mana, and icy terrain is best for producing Gold (for some reason), while neither are very good at producing Food (which is what you want the basic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenHillZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenHillZone">Green Hill Zone</a> terrain for.) However, if you find a portal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">Another Dimension</a>, watch out - the terrain there can be MUCH more hostile, including a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalLavaLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalLavaLand">Lethal Lava Land</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld">Dark World</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>. Fortunately, being a master of the arcane, you can alter terrain to suit your needs - to a somewhat limited degree normally, but if you find favor with the gods, you can even make hell freeze over...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> has various elemental panels which, depending on your element and chipset, may cause you to heal, slide around, take ongoing damage, etc. Using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">rock attack on a scissors panel</a> increase the damage dealt, and usually removes the panel effect as well.
<ul><li> Panels ranging from grass panels, on which wood-elementals regenerate, ice panels, where non-water types slide, sand, which slows movement, lava which damages non-fire types, poison which drains the health of everything (including anything wearing Float Shoes), holy panels which halve the damage intake of anything on it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">and a gate to hell.</a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has various weather effects and day cycles. When it is daylight outside, monsters can't spawn and undead monsters (zombies and skeletons) catch fire from the sunlight. When night falls, all the baddies come out to play, making exploration in the fields more dangerous. When it rains, the sky grows dark enough for undead not to burn up, and the rain also extinguishes wild fires. Thunderstorms do the same thing, but make the sky even darker, to the point where hostiles can spawn, and the lightning bolts can strike mobs for damage (including you), set flammable blocks on fire, change pigs into zombie pigmen, or make a creeper super charged for more explosive damage to everything.
</li><li> The landscape can be a hindrance or an advantage to the player. With enough height, you can strike mobs below you while they cannot reach you. If there's a huge drop off nearby, you can attack a mob and push them off a cliff for major damage or outright kill them.
</li><li> Endermen simply hate water. If they are outside when it is raining, they will teleport all over the place trying to seek shelter. Rainstorms are good if you want the Endermen to stay away.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nectaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nectaris">Nectaris</a></em>, rough terrain restricts movement range, but it also gives units defensive bonuses. Mountains provide a whopping 40% bonus, though they're inaccessible except to infantry, artillery and aircraft.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive">Paradox Interactive</a> games:
<ul><li> Most titles have this to a greater or lesser extent, ranging from attack penalties in forested or mountainous terrain or when crossing a river in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EuropaUniversalis">Europa Universalis</a></em>, to the detailed system in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeartsOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeartsOfIron">Hearts of Iron</a> 2</em>, where most terrain types except flat plains inflict penalties on the attacker and benefits to the defender. Said penalties vary from the fairly minor (a 10% or so penalty for attacking forest terrain) to the extreme (50% penalties for attacking jungle terrain, <em>66%</em> penalties for attacking urban terrain). Furthermore, the latter game <em>also</em> had a penalty for night combat. The weather penalties are even more unpleasant (-80% for frozen). Woe betide you if you end up fighting in, say, mountains in the winter, making your units essentially worthless without specialised troops and some <em>very</em> good commanders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> implemented this in an update that restricted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel">FTL Travel</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceLanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceLanes">Hyperspace Lanes</a>, which made picking which systems to fight in or fortify much more important. Nebulae block sensors, allowing fleets to spring ambushes or hide their strength. Black Holes greatly reduce damaged ships' ability to withdraw from combat before being destroyed, leading to more losses in battle. Neutron Stars cut ships' sublight speed in half, allowing fleets to capitalize on their weapons' range. And Pulsars completely negate any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a> within their system, which can cripple fleets that neglected to invest in armor or hull points.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, the terrain affects very little in battle (just a few moves, like Nature Power, Secret Power and Camouflage). What does affect battle is weather. The weather at the start of the battle is determined by where you are (clear is the default), but it can be changed by certain moves and abilities. A full list of weather effects can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Weather">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but the most common ones are damage to certain types of Pokemon and increased or decreased damage from certain move types.
<ul><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">particularly weird one</a> is the move Moonlight in generations III and IV having its effect <em>boosted</em> by bright sunlight (because moonlight does not have a weather condition).
<ul><li> The fact that moonlight is really just sunlight reflecting off the moon makes this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>.
</li><li> In the original Japanese, Sunny Day is called Clear Sky. That's why it works at night and helps Moonlight.
</li></ul></li><li> The environment also determines Burmy's form (and the form that female Burmy will take when they evolve into Wormadam).
</li><li> And there's Castform, a pokemon with the special effect to change type (AND appearance) depending on the weather (Sun, Rain, or Snow). It also comes with the attack Weather Ball, which works the same way.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> games, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.serebii.net/games/combo.shtml">you can make your own<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> geo effects, by using three specific moves in different combinations.
</li><li> Pokemon XY added a new class of terrain moves that work similarly to weather, but their effects can only be used by non-flying Pokemon.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonGatesToInfinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonGatesToInfinity">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity</a></em>, these show up in treasure rooms and randomly in any dungeon once you've cleared the main story. Effects include causing thrown items to pierce targets, causing heavier Pokemon to get a boosted critical rate, or causing attacks to be used twice in a row.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rimworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rimworld">Rimworld</a></em>, the biome and climate of your colony is a very important gameplay element that dictates much of your strategy. Temperate Forest offers fertile soil for crops, abundant lumber and lots of small and big game to hunt as well as cool winters and pleasant summers, ensuring thriving conditions for any colony. Tropical Rainforest has abundant resources but also combines intense heat, choking undergrowth, thick mud, conducive conditions for disease and aggressive venomous snakes combine for a "Green Hell" that will put any survivors to the test. Tundra represents sweeping grassland with few trees, along with cool summers and freezing winters; food will mostly come from hunting migratory megafauna and the predators that prey on them, and any farming will require greenhouses. Extreme Desert represents an extremely hot and dry area devoid of life or arable land, where farming is a pipe dream without hydroponics and moisture pumps. The silver lining to living in harsh conditions is that it is also harsh to any invading tribes or raiders, who will likely be half dead of hypothermia or heatstroke by the time they reach your defences.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations">Rise of Nations</a></em>, rocky terrain provides a 33% defenisve bonus to infantry units standing on it, and can't be built upon (with the exception of oil wells). It also has an "attrition" mechanic that deals damage to forces inside enemy territory, unless they have a supply unit nearby - the Russian special ability, "Russian Winter," boosts this damage by 50%.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier2">SaGa Frontier 2</a></em> allowed you to use the terrain you were standing on for magic. Standing on grass allowed you to use tree magic, snow allowed you to use water magic, etc.
</li><li> The core of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>'s gameplay involves shooting ink in your team's color to cover as much as the map as you can. While spreading ink alone <em>is</em> the objective in the game's main Turf War mode, players can also walk freely on and swim through their own ink while having their movement slowed down on enemy ink, making it essential for mobility in both Turf War and Ranked Battle.
<ul><li> The ink also serves another purpose in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em>'s Clam Blitz mode, making all clams on a team's ink appear on the map for that team only. This gives a strategic upper hand to teams that can better control the stage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftI">StarCraft I</a></em>, higher elevation increases a unit's range when striking at lower terrain. The expansion Terran campaign displays this very well, since one notable mission has higher terrain forming "gates" to your starting zone. Camp a few Siege Tanks on the higher zones, give them some Anti-Air support, and they'll never get anywhere near your base.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIIWIngsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftIIWIngsOfLiberty">Wings Of Liberty</a></em> campaign for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em>, several missions have hazardous terrain effects which can be used to one's advantage. In one, <em>The Devil's Playground</em>, there are periodic lava surges, which will quickly kill anything on the low ground. One of the game's achievements is to use one of these lava surges to kill a Brutalisk.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> loves these. They even have tiles of the HP/EN-regenerating sort. Mostly, however, they're there to discriminate against ground units - anything without a flight system has to spend an extra turn or two slogging through mountains or water, and winds up not being able to kill as many enemies once they actually get to the fight.
<ul><li> In later games, the movement penalties are mitigated somewhat by the units' own terrain ratings - a unit with an overall S-rank in a terrain isn't as bogged down - or their movement types.
</li><li> Recovery and defense tiles are actually invaluable in any of the several missions that start you out with a few units and ask you to survive until your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Cool Ship</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunshipRescue">shows up</a> with your proper army. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a> team is routinely subject to this.
</li><li> The game also uses this against you as well. One of the final missions in Original <em>Generation 2</em> had two boss-level characters appear on tiles that gave a 30% restoration to their HP and EN.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsDestiny">Super Robot Wars Destiny</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment">Judgment</a></em> have small battle puzzles that task you with surviving and/or destroying a few enemies within one or two turns. In many of them, half the puzzle is finding out exactly where you can stand that lets you soak/evade the enemy attacks and counterattack.
</li><li> It should be noted that (at least from the third game onward) flying units aren't always better. Flying units won't receive HP and EN bonuses from the aforementioned regen tiles or gain valuable cover, and moving a unit in the air will drain a bit of the unit's energy, while moving along the ground will not. And to top it all off, it traditionally costs flying units 5 EN per turn to stay in the air, plus 1 EN per flown square.
</li><li> And then you have space battles, where it typically costs everyone 1 EN to move a square, there are fields of debris, and the occasional terrain with HP/EN regeneration. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Alpha 3</a></em> even includes one space stage with a large -%20 EN (thanks a <em>lot</em>, Buff Clan!).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Steve's</a> unique gameplay style requires him to mine resources from the stage itself and what items you get are dependent on what materials make up said stage. For example, mining on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox64">Corneria</a>, which takes place above the spaceship Great Fox, will almost always result in large quantities of iron, which can be converted into durable blocks and weapons. Conversely, a place like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1">Kongo Jungle</a> that entirely consists of wooden platforms will only hand out weak, basic wood. This gameplay aspect is averted in the Omega and Battlefield variations, where every material type is accessible in a preset order, keeping things fair.
</li><li> A less conventional version appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgreTheKnightOfLodis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgreTheKnightOfLodis">Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis</a></em>. In this game, every <em>single</em> terrain tile has an effect on your party members. Lakes and rivers increases the effectiveness of Water spells, while reducing Fire. Standing on rough rocky terrain increases Earth power, and can boost your physical attacks. Each tile affects the power and resistances to each of the four elements in some way, and certain tiles can increase your offensive and defensive output overall.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, map environment fully defines the fight. Small chokepoints put fragile and mobile classes at a great disadvantage while making explosives, an good entrenched sniper, and sentry guns extremely powerful, while wide areas put all of those at varying levels of disadvantage against fast, mobile attackers. And high ground can make taking a capture point fiendishly difficult because it lets the defenders fire from cover without exposing themselves for too long, whereas attackers need to rely heavily on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rushing</a> fireteams with sniper support or sustained bombardment from rocket-jumping Soldiers and artillery-like stickybomb spam. This is even more brutal with multiple levels instead of a single slope, as exemplified in maps like Egypt and Badlands, both of which have capture points raised well above the battlefield and with scant cover on the way up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TenMinuteSpaceStrategy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TenMinuteSpaceStrategy">Ten Minute Space Strategy</a></em>, where you fight can easily decide on the outcome of the battle; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeFieldAdvantage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeFieldAdvantage">fighting above your colonies</a> (especially ones that have ancient defences on them), fighting within a radius of your military space stations and fighting in deep space with "space aces" trait all add to your effectiveness in battle.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToukenRanbu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToukenRanbu">Touken Ranbu</a></em>'s era 6 onward, battlefield conditions are introduced. "Nighttime" buffs small swords (tantō and wakizashi), debuffs big ones (tachi, ōdachi, yari and naginata), and has no effects on uchigatana; all swords have the ability to evade projectiles. "Urban areas" disables horses. "Indoor areas" disables horses, disable archers and catapults, and narrow the ranges of ōdachi and naginata. "Rain" disables musketeers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mountains, forests, rivers, bridges, fords, etc. all play a big part in positioning, both on the strategic or battle map. Entire armies, or individual units in them, can hide in forests to launch ambushes. River crossings form chokepoints on the world map and bottlenecks on the battle map, and units can try to bypass them through fords, but will move slowly as they wade through the water and will be more vulnerable to missile fire.
</li><li> Elevation has marked effects on battles. Units will move faster when charging downhill, and will slow to a crawl when marching uphill - telling a unit to run up a steep slope will rapidly deplete their stamina. Height advantage allows archers to shoot farther, and more importantly shoot over intervening units to deal direct damage rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoArcInArchery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoArcInArchery">arcing</a> their shots over the battle line. Telling units like slingers or musketmen to shoot through your lines <em>without</em> a hill to stand on is a good way to cause casualties in the rear of your own units.
</li><li> On the strategic map, marching your armies through the winter snows or blistering deserts is a good way to take attrition damage... though the latter can be traversed safely by factions like the Numidians, Egyptians or Moors. On the battle map, some units like Woodsmen or Desert Cavalry receive a combat bonus when fighting in their favored terrain.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on what Electronic Countermeasure/Support Aircraft or Facilities are snooping around the airspace in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VectorThrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VectorThrust">Vector Thrust</a></em>, the battle conditions can change significantly. Aircraft can be hidden with a 'stealth barrier', mirrored to grant the illusion that there are more of them than there really are, receive targeting information from an allied scout, receive detection range boosts and take advantage of other electronic support systems. Negative effects can range from mild inconveniences like having your map taken out to catastrophic events during the heat of battle like having their missile targeting systems taken offline or their IFFs disabled.
</li><li> One of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalAnnihilation">Total Annihilation</a></em>`s innovations was doing this before its Blizzard and Westwood counterparts - units on higher ground can shoot and see at a longer range, and mountains can also block the sight range of a unit on the ground.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> fighting spin-offs <em>Scarlet Weather Rhapsody</em> and <em>Hisoutensoku</em>, each weather type has a specific effect that can turn the tides in a fight. Example? Typhoon: all knock-back is ignored.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em>, your conscripts have various attributes that give them bonuses (or penalties) depending on various conditions, and the type of ground they're walking on is one of those conditions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> 3</em>, ranged units who are at a lower elevation than the units they are attacking have a chance of missing said attacks, though spells and whatnot are exempt from this rule.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> video games:
<ul><li> In the <em>Rites of War</em> turn-based strategy game, terrain affects both defense and movement. Interestingly, the effect on movement varies based on the movement mode of the unit in question. Flying units ignore terrain altogether, while hovering units ignore most terrain, except hills or mountains, which force them to divert power to lift, slowing them down. Large walkers can simply stride over most obstacles, but still have trouble with swamps, and of course cannot pass over lakes or seas. Heavy infantry has to move in formation, which is generally the slowest and most impeded by terrain, while light infantry can more easily negotiate obstacles.
</li><li> In ther RTS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>, units take less damage and regenerate morale more quickly when in cover, using an alternate crouching animation. They take more damage when in 'negative' cover, such as crossing a river. Several units take advantage of this by having weapons that ignore cover or move through it without losing speed. <em>Dawn of War II</em> uses a system closer to the one in <em>Company of Heroes.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarlockMasterOfTheArcane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarlockMasterOfTheArcane">Warlock: Master Of The Arcane</a></em> has variety of effects. There are standard movement and vision limits, but also some special areas that provide special resource and/or damage the units on the tile.
</li><li> The wave patterns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WaveRace">Wave Race 64</a></em> are essential to know to make the track work in your advantage. <em>Wave Race: Blue Storm</em> takes this up a notch with weather patterns and more randomly-generated waves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldInConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldInConflict">World in Conflict</a></em> is actually all over this trope. Not only can infantry hide in houses (giving them crazy defense, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingBreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingBreaks">as long as it stands</a>) and woods (rendering them invisible as long as they don't open fire), but tanks can shoot further and more precisely down from slopes; all units move faster downhill (and vice versa); anti-air batteries, while unable to enter the forests, can stand on its edge, rendering them invisible from one direction. Obstacles are also correctly limiting the shooting range (even mobile units: a heavy tank can easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">take a shell</a> for an AA unit just by standing in front of it), so it's actually a good idea to hide your AA in the depths of a nuclear blast crater once the radiation dissipates.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WrathUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WrathUnleashed">Wrath Unleashed</a></em>, each character has a specific "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">element</a>", and each stage has at least one element associated with it. Characters whose elements match the stage they are fighting on are damaged less by stage hazards and receive greater bonuses from powerups.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em>, having height advantage over the enemy - whether from standing on a roof or hovering with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack">Jet Pack</a> - grants your unit bonuses to accuracy and evasion. This effect can be boosted by Snipers' "Damn Good Ground" ability or, in the <em>Enemy Within</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">Expansion Pack</a>, by "Depth Perception" gene mod.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YggdraUnion">Yggdra Union</a></em>, some units have a "specialist" terrain type (e.g., forest specialist). Units gain an advantage when fighting on this type of terrain and are much more likely to win duels.
<ul><li> Some maps have stationary catapults on them. The army that includes catapults in their formation gains an advantage and their units are more likely to win duels.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeCover">Take Cover!</a> is essential to modern infantry tactics.
</li><li> The Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union in 1939-40, which ended with a ceasefire and Finland losing only a small part of its territory to the Soviet Union while retaining its sovereignty, is a prime example of how this trope can be applied in real life. Despite being outnumbered 3 to 1, the Finns made full use of the winter season, forested terrain and long nights to wreak havoc on the Soviet troops, who were more used to fighting in warmer climates and were still reeling from a lack of leadership and morale due to Joseph Stalin's Great Purge two years earlier. An additional bonus was that the Finnish soldiers wore white snowsuits to blend in with the terrain and were excellent cross-country skiers.
<ul><li> The Swedish plans against ground invasion relied on Finnish tactics. Just like the Soviet's overwhelming advantage in tanks was cancelled out by forcing them into narrow roads which were the only way through the forests so the Finns only faced a few at any one time, the famous Swedish S-Tank was designed around that strategy: a low profile that made it hard to hit, a fixed gun designed to deal with tanks forced into narrow forest roads, and the ability to drive backward just as fast as forward (and a second driver specifically for that task) so the tank could engage an enemy force, then quickly scoot back to another position and do it again.
</li></ul></li><li> The greatest Russian military commander of the Napoleonic and Second World Wars was General Winter, ably assisted by his cousin Major Mud. Crossing the Russian countryside in winter, late fall, or early spring without the use of a paved road was essentially impossible, and played havoc with the movement of troops and supplies for both the Grande Armee and the Wehrmacht.
<ul><li> General Winter did not always help Russians. Mongols were able to crisscross the Russian plains and conquer at will thanks to frozen rivers and swamps. Even during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, frozen ground on which tanks could maneuver easily gave the Germans an excellent chance to capture Moscow at the end of 1941, during which they penetrated into outskirts of the city, even if they failed at the end.
</li></ul></li><li> Much of Switzerland's ability to remain neutral is based on the fact it's surrounded by mountainous terrain and trains its army to specialise in mountain combat (even the tanks they use are more or less perfect for defending Switzerland and nothing else).
<ul><li> Switzerland also controls a large amount of the water supply for several countries.
</li><li> The main reason that Switzerland has been able to remain neutral for so long is savvy diplomacy; this trope really only gives insight as to why they've been able to fight off or at least deter anyone whom diplomacy couldn't placate (with the notable exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoleon</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Knowing the terrain and using guerilla tactics in Vietnam gave the Vietcong such an advantage that the US was unable to gain a conventional victory. Combined with pressure at home to leave, rising costs and lack of local support, the US was forced to withdraw and leave the south Vietnamese government to fend for itself... and perish.
<ul><li> The US tried to remove this advantage by spraying liberal amounts of airborne defoliants on the jungles the Vietcong were so fond of hiding in- which only succeeded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">giving people spinal cord injuries and birth defects, which are still happening in the year 2014, nearly 40 years since the war ended in 1975</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Sun Tzu's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtOfWarSunTzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheArtOfWarSunTzu">The Art of War</a></em>, the oldest tactical and strategic manual in existence, includes chapters on how to use terrain to best military advantage.
</li><li> One incident during the wars between the Spanish and the Dutch saw a Dutch army led by William the Silent breaking the Spanish siege of Leyden by destroying the nearby dikes and flooding them out. (He later founded the University of Leyden to commemorate his victory.)
<ul><li> The above situation was inverted just over two centuries later when the French invaded the Netherlands during the wars of the First Coalition, taking advantage of a cold winter and the resultant frozen rivers/harbours to not only counter the above Dutch tactic, but also take the Dutch navy with <em>cavalry</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Often a common tactic used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> in the Persian campaign. The use of a small passage surrounded by coast and hills was exploited in The Battle of Issus, with Alexander flanking the Persian troops from the hills and solidly defeating them; in the Battle of the River Hydaspes, Alexander used the rain and the raging river to keep his movements secret from the Indians and maintain the element of surprise. Also subverted by Alexander in the Battle of Gaugamela, a battle Alexander won, despite the Persians deliberately choosing the large, flat plain because it benefited their larger numbers.
</li><li> At the Battle of Thermopylae, 1500 Greeks (including the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a> Spartans) held off 250,000 Persians for three days and recorded almost 100,000 casualties by bottlenecking them in the eponymous cliffs.
<ul><li> Also, the Athenian-led Greek navy pulled their weight as well. Despite a rout at Artemision at about the same time as Thermopylae, they met Persian navy shortly thereafter at Salamis, holding a narrow strait in much the same way as at Thermopylae. This kept the Persians from bypassing the Greek defenses for southern Attica and the Peloponnese, allowing the Greek alliance to win the war despite the destruction of Athens.
</li></ul></li><li> Britain is an island kingdom, and as late as World War II, their navy was feared worldwide.
</li><li> Terrain was most likely the largest factor that contributed to the Union victory at Gettysburg. Not only did the Union hold the high ground, giving their artillery a huge advantage, but the Confederates were forced to attack across a large, open plain with no cover from Union artillery and gunfire.
</li><li> Much like the Gaugamela example, the Romans tried this one on Hannibal at Cannae, selecting a wide open plain where the Roman heavy infantry could just roll over Hannibal's outnumbered forces, and where any ambush would surely be spotted. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">didn't work</a> as the Romans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">plowed straight into the middle of a Carthaginian encirclement anyway.</a> The only survivors were the ones who cut through the Carthaginian centre... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackRetreatRetreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackRetreatRetreat">and kept on running.</a>
<ul><li> The guy who organized the Roman retreat happened to be Scipio Africanus, the man who eventually defeated Hannibal. Needless to say, the Romans learned their lesson.
</li><li> It took them awhile. Hannibal was a master of geo effects and used them in two earlier battles to defeat Roman armies. First at the Trebia where he encouraged the Romans to charge through an ice cold river. Second at the Lake Trasimene where caught a Roman army in an ambush between the lake shore and the wooded hills where his light troops were hidden.
</li></ul></li><li> The Battle of Bunker Hill during the American Revolution was this in textbook form. It all started when relatively small group of colonial militia had taken their (semi-legal) cache of arms and supplies atop a small hill, and a troop of regular soldiers was dispatched to disarm them. Command hoped that the militiamen wouldn't resist the attempt to confiscate their weapons, and if they did it was hoped that they would quickly give themselves up or scatter when things got serious. As it was, they were determined to resist and had the discipline to hold a line and pick the regulars off in droves as they attempted to scale the hill. The rebels inflicted several times their own casualties on the government forces by the time the hill was taken. It showed that the situation was truly beyond the diplomatic solution everyone had been hoping for, and that the rebels' militia could prove more than a match for the government's troops. General Incompetence was astoundingly common throughout the war on both sides, but the most important lesson of the battle was apparently half-remembered at best as time and again British colonials tried directly assaulting the government's fortified positions.
<ul><li> It was remembered in Boston, at least. When Washington took command, he took the identical tactics: send men over the isthmus in the night to entrench on one of those hills and bring along your cannon. The British forces took one look and made plans to evacuate the city. Anyone who has studied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">Anglo-Irish relations</a> and who is passingly familiar with the large Irish-American population in modern-day Boston will be amused to learn that the evacuation was ordered on St. Patrick's Day.
</li><li> The general incomptence of the British Commanders was a large factor in this, both allowing the rebels to dig in and then opting for a frontal assault on the hill due to underestimating the rebel forces.
</li></ul></li><li> Altitude has an effect on breathing; thus, performing in sporting events in higher regions can be more difficult than in lower. People <em>from</em> the high ground (who are more used to less oxygen per breath) have the advantage everywhere, but it's much more noticeable in the mountains.
<ul><li> The United States took advantage of the Rockies to train men for the Alps. This resulted in some Italian soldiers being quite shocked by the sight of these men <em>running uphill in the Alps.</em>
</li><li> Speaking of Italy, the reason conquering it was so difficult was the terrain: expecting sunny plains, the Allies deployed normal troops and tanks in a country largely composed of hills and the Apennines mountain range (they <em>could</em> have avoided it, had they listened to the Italians on their side), while the Germans, having listened to the Italians on their side, took full advantage of the terrain, and were effectively invulnerable until the Moroccan mountain troops supplied by the Free French and the Italian Royal Army (that knew the terrain but was short on numbers) could be supplemented by British Highlanders and the above-mentioned troops trained in the Rockies (trained to fight in the Alps too but originally raised to fight in the Apennines), after which the difficulty improved from "impossible" to "hellishly difficult but doable" (they finally conquered Italy, including the sunny plains of the <em>north</em> they expected at first, on May 2, 1945, the same day the Soviets conquered Berlin and <em>two days after Hitler's death</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> Common tactic of AH-64 Apache choppers when dealing with tanks. The idea is to hide under the treeline, pop up to launch a Hellfire, then duck back down under the cover of the trees or other terrain features. If they have someone else spotting the shot (a forward controller on the ground, or an aircraft flying over the battlefield, for example), they don't even need to come out of cover to launch the missile.
<ul><li> This tactic proved so effective that the AH-64D (the Longbow) was specifically designed to do it even better. The helicopter's fire-control radar was relocated to a sensor pod <em>above</em> the main rotor, allowing it to track targets and fire missiles without ever having to leave cover.
</li><li> Also used by the 160th SOAR, the Night Stalkers. These pilots use helicopters with terrain mapping radar to fly in canyons to avoid radar. Notably used in the 2011 raid against bin Laden's compound in Abbottobad, Pakistan.
</li></ul></li><li> The US and Canada are pretty much immune from massive invasion forces due to being far away across the sea from most of the rest of the world. Still, if the warring party wants to make the long trek across the sea, both of them are two of the largest countries on the globe with a wide variety of terrains. Not that modern warfare has much need for invasions anymore.
<ul><li> On top of the long distances involved, potential invaders would also have to deal with the fact that large numbers of the civilian populace of both countries are armed, or have access to firearms through friends or family. On top of this, many of those people hunt, and know the terrain like the backs of their hands. So, to put it in perspective, assuming your fleet gets out of its harbor and doesn't get bombed to oblivion by the Air Force, or sniped from the depths by US submarines, or meet any one of the eleven US Supercarriers (which is at least seven more than any other nation can put to sea), and the force actually <em>DOES</em> land on a US beach, the invaders will very quickly find themselves facing 300 <em>million</em> people who have access to firearms and most likely know how to use them... it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> that convinced Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto that invading the United States would be a <em>very</em> bad idea.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto:</strong> I will never invade the United States, there would be a rifle behind every blade of grass.
</div><ul><li> Also worth noting that if Japan <em>had</em> invaded the U.S., they'd have had to do so from the west coast, which would have meant fighting their way through a very broad system of mountain ranges and desert basins, which wouldn't have made it any easier.
</li></ul></li><li> All three of Canada, the US (in the case of Alaska) and Russia have their northern borders essentially undefended, and no plans to move troops there to defend them, except for radar coverage for the simple reasons that it's the Arctic, so hard enough to do anything in to begin with; none of the countries have anything strategically critical for their survival in the region to be captured should someone be stupid enough to try an invasion; and finally, getting anywhere important from the Arctic coasts with a ground force would be essentially impossible due to lack of infrastructure. For example, for a country with the world's longest coastline, and by far the world's longest northern coastline, there is exactly <em>one</em> all-season road connecting Canada's Arctic coast to the rest of the country, and it only finished construction in 2017. The way of dealing with any force stupid enough to try an attack is leave them there until they're bear food.
</li><li> Japan was protected by the Mongolian invasion of their islands by the same situation regarding the sea and the weather that saved England (mentioned above in the Britain example). These events are the origin of the term kamikaze (divine wind).
</li><li> Cultures who were well-known for ambush or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">skirmishing tactics</a> frequently lived in regions of "hard" terrain, with many trees and/or hills/mountains around it. Such features made it easy for warriors to pre-emptively surround their enemies unbeknownst to them, and also make it difficult to chase them with how easily they could go out of sight and how horses would be hampered from running in the area. The cultures who still did such tactics regularly despite living in open terrain were surely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheSaddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheSaddle">Born in the Saddle</a> instead, relying on their horses' speed to outmaneuver their adversaries.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">applied this against himself</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchAndIndianWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchAndIndianWar">French and Indian War</a> with Ft. Necessity. The entire fort was surrounded by hills and the attackers had easy shots into the fort, and eventually rainwater collected into the fort ruining the gunpowder.
</li><li> The Earth chapter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MiyamotoMusashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MiyamotoMusashi">Miyamoto Musashi</a>'s <em>Book of Five Rings</em> discussed taking advantage of terrain types and altitudes, with more emphasis on the marshaling of troops, drawn from his own experiences in command.
</li><li> The reason why thousands of American soldiers died when invading Germany at Omaha beach. The Germans had a gigantic beach, followed by high hills filled with bunkers, while the American forces had boats that put them straight into the open the second they would leave. Additionally, the Germans had placed multiple obstacles on the beach (including thousands of land mines mounted on sticks just tall enough to be functional but invisible in the waters, which exploded when landing craft or emerging troops hit them) to avoid the soldiers simply charging for the hills, resulting in a brutal bloodbath.
<ul><li> The Rhine was a natural obstacle for the western allies while invading Germany. German forces destroyed multiple bridges, hoping to block off the invasion or at least slow them down considerably. The plan might have been successful, if it weren't for certain bridges not breaking upon the explosions getting activated.
</li></ul></li><li> As demonstrated <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9FrN58T-VE">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the memetic case with Obi-Wan and Anakin is not actually the advantage in a one-on-one fight the film (and pop culture) suggests.
