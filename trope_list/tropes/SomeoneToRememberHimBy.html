<ul><li> One memorable episode was about the vengeful girlfriend of a criminal Leon killed in the line of duty. D manages to break the cycle of revenge by appealing to her that she did not want her unborn child's mother to be a murderer.
</li><li> A second, much darker version occurs in <em>Pet Shop of Horrors: Tokyo</em>. A woman's dead boyfriend is temporarily brought back to spend O-bon with her on the one-year anniversary of his death. At the end, he prepares to return to the land of the dead, but she is unwilling to let him go. She is found a week later in her apartment with the rotting corpse of her boyfriend... and now pregnant.
</li><li> Another one from Tokyo involves a down-on-her-luck novelist adopting a cicada larva simply because it was unusual. Through the actions of the larva turned human boy who helps her a la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiWaPetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiWaPetto">Kimi wa Petto</a></em> she hooks up with a composer who happened to be at Count D's the same day she was. Obviously they get together, but in true fashion when it comes to cicada's both males both die and leave the females (the man had gotten a female cicada larva) pregnant.
</li></ul></li><li> Gender-flipped in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nicoichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nicoichi">Nicoichi</a></em>, when the main protagonist adopted the son of his single mother girlfriend, who had passed away after being involved in a traffic accident. This act became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath">trigger for the plot</a> of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiRen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiRen">Ai-Ren</a></em>, Ai and Ikuru <em>both</em> die, but their child - gestated in an artificial womb - is "born" and taken care of by Haruka-sensei, who possibly would have been Ikuru's lover had circumstances between them been different.

<ul><li> This book contains multiple examples of this trope.

</li><li> In Michelle Magorian's <em>A Little Love Song</em>/<em>Not a Swan</em>, Hilda, who is a nurse during World War I, falls in love with an injured soldier. They have sex just before he has to go back to war, and then he dies in battle. Even more heart wrenching in that when Hilda's brothers find out she's pregnant, they put her in a mental institution and force her to give up the baby for adoption as soon as he's born.
</li><li> Subverted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobinMcKinley">Robin McKinley</a>'s <em>Beauty</em>.

</li><li> Similar to the midpoint of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThornBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThornBirds">The Thorn Birds</a></em>, where Meggie becomes pregnant by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Father Ralph just before he leaves her and returns to the Church</span> and specifically says that this baby will be a part of him that she can keep. The child becomes one of the two major protagonists of the second half of the novel, and is a prime example of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOutLikeHisFather">Turn Out Like His Father</a>" trope. Her mother Fee did this with her son Frank, since she and his father could not be together (he was married).

Harriet determines that he died the day after the two of them consummated their relationship, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but that the military is covering up his death because they planted false information about Norwegian defences on his body, then secretly dumped it off the coast of Germany to be found by the Nazis</span>.

They even marry knowing that he's likely going to be dead by the end of the week. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted in that the child is born premature and dies two days later.</span>

This is Percy's main criticism of his father, Poseidon. However, it is subverted by the fact that some of them occasionally visit their lovers/kids (like Hermes, for example, though it is rare). Most are pretty much out of the picture though.
<ul><li> You could also argue that the female gods pull similar shit on male mortals, deliberately having a one night stand to purposely impregnate herself, and then dumping the guy with a baby nine months later with no convictions to pay child support or help raise it. (Like Athena, for example)

Ava is left pregnant after Jacob runs away, but she miscarries. Isabel is still pregnant when Christian dies, but she also miscarries. Midi manages to carry her baby to term, but she's not sure who the father is and the afterword would suggest she's not so attached to Arthur, the man she supposedly loved, after all.
</li><li> In Robert Buettner's <em>Orphanage</em> the besieged Ganymede Expeditionary force have finally located the enemy base. Because it's on the other side of Ganymede and they are about to be overrun, their only hope is for their mothership to bombard the site the next time it overflies the target. The ship's captain Metzger confesses that their computers are out and that it'll be another orbit before they can take the shot, which will too late. The expeditionary force's CO then tells Metzger that Mrs Metzger, currently on the surface, is pregnant. Evacuating the rest of the crew, Metzger manually pilots the ship to crash into the enemy base, saving the expeditionary force and his unborn child.

The girlfriend isn't affected at first, though, despite being heavily pregnant, later tries to get drunk.
<ul><li> In a way, Aeryn Sun's son D'Argo Crichton-Sun could be considered an example. John Crichton was "twinned" in one episode and in the next the party split in half for multiple episodes and the two Johns went with different groups. The John Crichton who was with Aeryn developed a relationship with her, then died shortly after. It took a while after the group reunited for Aeryn to get together with the other Crichton, by which time she was confirmed to be pregnant by the dead Crichton, the live one considers it his son all the same though.

Rorg stays behind due to her pregnancy and Rorf ultimately dies taking a bullet for Crichton without meeting his offspring. A fellow conspirator promises to deliver Rorf's share of the profit from the job to Rorg and her children.

</li><li> Kazakh singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RozaRymbaeva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RozaRymbaeva">Roza Rymbaeva</a> was seven months pregnant with her second child when her husband suddenly died of a heart attack.
</li><li> Broadway actress and singer LaChanze was eight months pregnant when her husband was killed in the 9/11 attacks.
</li><li> <em>People</em> Magazine did an article on <a class="urllink" href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20524377,00.html">children born after their fathers had perished in the 9/11 attacks.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Ethel Kennedy had her 11th child six months after RFK's assassination.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a>'s wife Maria was pregnant with their first child in 1959, when an airplane carrying Holly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens">Ritchie Valens</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBigBopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBigBopper">The Big Bopper</a> (J.P. Richardson) crashed in Iowa, killing everyone on board. In a sad subversion of the trope, she miscarried soon after his death. J.P. Richardson's wife was also pregnant and didn't miscarry. What is interesting is that said child, J.P. Richardson III, some time after his mother's passing, viewed his father's well-preserved body when the cemetery wanted to move his parents to a section that allowed a more noticeable monument.
</li><li> When French singer Daniel Balavoine died in a helicopter crash during a charitable visit to Mali in early 1986, he left behind not only an infant son (for whom he wrote the song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u8FirBL3eo">Dieu que c'est beau<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), but his wife who was four months pregnant. His daughter Joana is now a musician herself and has often talked about discovering her father through his music, though she is bothered by the narrative that her father's death was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.
</li><li> The sinking of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">Titanic</a></em> caused a few pregnant spouses and girlfriends to be left behind.
</li><li> When Revolutionary War hero Ethan Allen died in February 1789, his wife was about a month pregnant with their fourth child (his eighth), and gave birth the following October.
</li><li> In a modern variant, husbands faced with risky surgical procedures or terminal illnesses have been known to have their sperm stored with their wives' approval, so that this trope might be posthumously invoked in the event they don't make it off the operating table.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumous_birth#Royalty_and_nobility">surprising list<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of kings and nobles. Shapur II of Persia is reputed to be the only king who was <em>crowned</em> before his birth. Legend has it this was done by placing it symbolically on his mother's belly while he was in utero.
</li><li> Singer Hank Williams' daughter, Jett, was born a mere <em>five days</em> after he died.
</li><li> When King James IV of Scotland was killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, his wife was one month pregnant with their youngest son, Alexander (who ultimately died in infancy).
</li><li> Premature babies surviving more and more often can result in a gender-flipped version where the husband is left behind with his surviving child as early as six months in pregnancy.
</li><li> Agrippa Postumus was the third son of Augustus's daughter Julia and his original intended heir, the great general Agrippa. The "Postumus" tag to a son's name was not uncommon among the war-prone Roman nobility, though Agrippa apparently died of natural causes at age 51. Unfortunately for Agrippa Postumus, Augustus's adoptive heir Tiberius did not want the legitimate bloodline of Augustus to be remembered.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s youngest son <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Leopold,_Duke_of_Albany">Prince Leopold<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> died in 1884, he left behind a pregnant wife and an infant daughter. His son Charles Edward was born four months after his death.
</li><li> Arkansas travelling salesman William Jefferson Blythe, Jr. was killed in an accident in Missouri in 1946 when he was thrown from his car into a drainage ditch and drowned before he could climb out. Three months later, his widow, Virginia, gave birth to a son whom she named after his late father. She latter remarried, and her son took his stepfather's surname; he is now better known as 42nd US President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>.
</li><li> Astronaut Clifton "C.C." Williams died on October 5, 1967, in a jet crash when his T-38 Talon, which he was flying from Cape Kennedy to Mobile, Alabama—so he could see his father, who was dying of cancer—crashed near Tallahassee, Florida. Shortly after, his wife, Beth Williams, found out she was pregnant with their second child. The child was born on May 31, 1968.
