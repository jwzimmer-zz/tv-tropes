<div class="indent">— <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dessa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dessa">Dessa</a></strong>, "Dixon's Girl"
</div></div><p>This is an insidious trope where a female character's success is undermined by the narrative of a male character providing advantages necessary for them. She's usually framed as someone's sister, girlfriend, or love interest. And if she's a military or political leader of some sort, then you can bet that she got the position with help from her father or another male relative.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Under this trope, a female character's membership in a field — usually male-dominated — is implied to be mostly due to motivation and training by her male relatives or acquaintances who are active in the same field, rather than her own independent ambitions. However, there may be a certain element of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standards</a> present in this aspect of the trope; namely, the notion that a strong woman's achievements — no matter how genuine her efforts were in gaining them — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">aren't worthy of recognition</a> if a man was involved in making her the person she is now in the past — even if he only gave her training, support, and advice to aid her rather than grant her any advantages that undermine her efforts — or simply if she has any ties to men <em>at all</em>. A woman receiving help from another woman in working towards her goals, a man receiving help from another man, or a man receiving help from another woman are seen in a far less negative light than a woman receiving help from a man, even though none are any different from the other in practice.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This character stands in contrast to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a>, where a character (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale">usually male</a>, but not always) was able to accomplish goals well beyond their advantages. In short, this is another example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>. Due to stereotypes about separate gender roles, writers will often use this trope to justify to viewers (presumed male) why they should care about the female character at all, as it is assumed the female character would not have taken an interest had it not been for the presence of that male character.
</p><p>Going hand with this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenActWomenAre">Men Act, Women Are</a>, which is about what comes from the man, and where the woman comes from; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemalesAreMoreInnocent">Females Are More Innocent</a>, where if a woman is evil, its usually the fault of a man. Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineageComesFromTheFather">Lineage Comes from the Father</a>, which deals with bloodlines. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBrothers">I Have Brothers</a> is a more mild version of this trope that nonetheless associates a woman's less traditionally feminine interests with a male influence rather than her own volition.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Keep in mind that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant">this is not</a> the strict inverse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeWoman">Self-Made Woman</a> and does not apply to every instance of a female character being helped by a male friend, relative, or love interest to reach her position. Rather, the male character must be implied to be more important to the plot or setting than the female character is, and the main force responsible for her position (e.g. the token female of the squad is a skilled soldier, but she's introduced as "the general's daughter" first and foremost, whereas her male companions aren't defined in the same way).
</p><p><strong>Please don't add any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">"aversions"</a> to the example list. Unless the trope is near omnipresent, examples where it's not used are not "aversions". For more info, see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted Trope</a> page.</strong>
</p><p><strong>Also note that male characters owing their success to more powerful women are generally not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">"inversions"</a> of this trope unless the setting carries the same implications (women are expected to be self-made while men are not).</strong>

<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, Shizuka's only real part to play was Jonouchi's helpless blind or captive sister. She also owes her part in the show to the fact that the love triangle between her, Honda and Otogi is played for laughs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Everything that Sakura Haruno does always has something to do with Sasuke and Naruto. She broke off her friendship with Ino to compete for Sasuke's affections, she makes her hair long in hopes to impress Sasuke, and finally she wants to train with Tsunade because she wants to be equal with them.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mxnc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mxnc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mxnc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Compare this with Sasuke who trains in order to kill Itachi while Naruto trains not only to bring Sasuke back but also fight against the mysterious Akatsuki forces.</span>
</li><li> Tsunade is the student of the Third Hokage as well as being descended from the Senju clan which the First and Second Hokages (her grandfather and granduncle respectively) hail from. However, she becomes a Hokage because she wants to inherit both her brother, her lover, and Naruto's legacy. This can be best shown in her Infinite Tsukuyomi dream where Dan becomes Hokage instead while Tsunade became his loyal secretary with Jiraiya and Orochimaru as her companions.
</li><li> Initially averted with Kurenai in the first series as she is known as the Jounin teacher of Hinata, Kiba, and Shino without any mentions of her being this status because of the influence of a male. Only for Shippuden to later play this straight as she is demoted from a teacher into Asuma's lover as she retires from her role as a ninja in favor of being a non-action mother with Shikamaru in charge of protecting her. Exactly what her father intended for her to be. Any role she had as a teacher for Team 8 is completely forgotten as Kakashi takes care of them now from start to finish.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Konan</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">only female member</a> of the Akatsuki and in contrast to her other male colleagues who have colorful personalities and backstories, Konan's only personality is being a loyal friend of Yahiko and Nagato -both males who have a sizable amount of personality-. She only became a member because of Nagato and upon his death, she defected from it.
</li></ul></li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors">Pet Shop of Horrors</a>: Tokyo</em> story, the widow of a murdered gang leader is introduced and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> assume that she got her own position at the head of the gang because of who her husband had been. It's actually subverted though when it's revealed that <em>she</em> was the highly respected head of the gang and her husband had been the one to marry into a high position.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a> 2032</em>, Sylia Stingray was able to create the Knight Sabers and fight Genom thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">hardsuits</a> her scientist father invented. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">On the other hand,</a> her father might have built them and her brother Mackie might do most of the repair and maintenance side, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDoesHeGetAllThoseWonderfulToys">the money to keep them running</a> comes from Sylia's <em>extremely</em> successful day job running an upmarket boutique.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, much of Videl's claim to fame is that she is the daughter of Mr. Satan (Hercule in the American version), a former world martial arts champion, superstar, and the #1 human fighter who doesn't use Ki, and she gets much of her combat skills from training with her love interest Gohan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, Kenshin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> Kaoru Kamiya is introduced as the heir of a swordsmanship dojo, and her prowess in swordfighting is attributed to the techniques taught by her father.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BambooBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BambooBlade">Bamboo Blade</a></em>. Tamaki mentions the strongest kendoist she's ever seen, and her teammates assume she's talking about her father, but she actually means her mother.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ritsuko Akagi actively resents that her mother Naoko's position at GEHIRN helped her get hers and despite her attempts to defy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyeHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyeHard">bleaching her hair blond</a>), Ritsuko comes to realize over the series that she's standing far more in her mother's shadow than she'd like to acknowledge, to the point of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sleeping with the same man</span>.
</li><li> Yui is an even more interesting case, being an <em>inversion</em> of the trope. Gendo was her husband and is the head of NERV <em>now</em>, but didn't really start taking his studies seriously until he got involved with Yui. It appears at first that Shinji is involved because he's Gendo's son, but it turns out that him being Yui's son is much more important, since his EVA is also Yui in a way. Rei is a clone of Yui. Fuyutsuki was Yui's mentor; he's kind of only still in it out of loyalty to her. All in all, Yui is definitely the central person in the series, even though she'd been dead for years when it starts. One indication of this, though we don't find it out for quite a while, is that "Ikari" is <em>her</em> family name; Gendo's family name was Rokubungi, but when they married he took her name rather than the other way around.
</li></ul></li><li> Oriko's backstory in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PuellaMagiOrikoMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PuellaMagiOrikoMagica">Puella Magi Oriko Magica</a></em> plays with this. She's the daughter of a politician and was extremely popular, but people tended to think of her as Hisaomi Mikuni's daughter first and foremost. When her father was accused of corruption and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">committed suicide</a>, Oriko was abandoned by her classmates, in large part because they didn't want to associate with someone related to Hisaomi. Despairing and realizing that people merely saw her as an extension of her father, Oriko contracted with Kyubey, making a wish to understand the true meaning of her life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> has a case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Chrome Dokuro</a>, whose powers really come from her being a vessel to the powerful illusionist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Rokudo Mukuro</a>, and she has lost pretty much every fight she's been in and she has to let Mukuro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandTheftMe">posses her</a> in order to win.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> doesn't have too much of this, but there's still a few examples:
<ul><li> During <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em> it's revealed through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> that Misa Hayase didn't care for the military, but joined because her Colonel father expected it of her because she comes from a long line of military relatives. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Also we find out that her childhood friend she had a crush on, was another reason why Misa Hayase joined in hopes of reuniting with him. She discovered he died on Mars and temporarily became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterruptedSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterruptedSuicide">suicidal</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>: Cathy Glass is a ranking officer in the New U.N. Joint Chiefs of Staff and the correspondent between the Frontier government and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractor">S.M.S.</a>, but she's still the daughter of the Frontier president, former girlfriend of the S.M.S. commander, and fiancee of another prominent government figure, and few of her scenes or motivations don't reference at least one of these.
</li></ul></li><li> Naomi Misora of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> only gets in on the plot because she's Raye Penber's fiancee, despite being an ex-FBI agent and part of the team L uses and being a very talented investigator (albeit one who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman">often lets her emotions compromise those talents</a>). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Light eventually has to eliminate her because of it.</span> It's slightly more grating because of Raye's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> attitude towards her, even though she's actually more skilled than he is.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokureiSochiDantaiStellaJogakuinKoutoukaC3Bu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokureiSochiDantaiStellaJogakuinKoutoukaC3Bu">Tokurei Sochi Dantai Stella Jogakuin Koutou-ka C³-bu</a></em>.

Through the course of the story, we discover that Superman was secretly helping her all along. Remember, girls, even if you <em>think</em> you succeeded on your own merits, it's really because a man was helping you. Lois is usually an aversion, however: in most versions both before and after that story — including Siegel and Shuster's original — Lois was well-established at the paper (<em>Star</em> or <em>Planet</em>) before Clark and his costumed counterpart ever arrived in Metropolis.

</li><li> Earth-2 Supergirl (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a>) was constantly trying to prove she didn't need her cousin's mentoring anymore, going so far to tell him she <em>couldn't</em> listen to his well-meaning advice because she needed to follow her own path.

Eventually this is even added on to as shown at the end when she finally does set up her restaurant it is shown to be green and frog-themed and named "Tiana's Palace", clearly based off of her experience as a frog that she spent with her prince.

Later on, this turns out to be an inversion, as all the men try to play her as a puppet because, ultimately, a great deal of their power <em>rests solely on Victoria liking them.</em> Albert goes behind her back because he feels useless and knows that every iota of his respect in the British court stems from his relationship with Victoria.

<ul><li> The seven known burn marks on the House of Black's family tapestry fit this trope. The four males were stricken from the family tree for various reasons, the three females were all stricken from it because of whom they married (a Muggle, a Weasley and a Muggleborn, respectively).
</li><li> It should be noted that Bellatrix and McGonagall, the two main female characters who don't have children, do become successful in their chosen fields; Bellatrix is Voldemort's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> and one of the most formidable Death Eaters, while McGonagall is Head of Gryffindor and later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Head of Hogwarts</span>. We are told through Pottermore how she inherited her magical powers from her mother and shared many of her mother's favorite activities when she went to Hogwarts. While her father was mentioned a few times, very little is given on his influence on her. However, most of Bellatrix's actions are driven by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadLove">obsessive love</a> for Voldemort.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em> gives the ladies the same treatment: the only women in the main cast are the fiancées to others in the team. Also something of an inversion in that most of the team is composed of 'Lucy's suitors' and in most of the bits of the book happening after Transylvania, Jonathan appears as 'Mina's husband' rather than the other way around, even though Mina does first appear as 'Jonathan's fiancée'.
</li><li> Juliet Butler in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> books could be an example of this trope - as well as the related trope if she were more of a character. She is characterized largely as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Butler's</a> little sister," and the great majority of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">physical skills</a> and knowledge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser">bodyguarding</a> comes from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBrothers">brother/family</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1l7bt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1l7bt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1l7bt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The argument can also be made that family is the only reason <em>Butler</em> has his position too.</span> She doesn't seem to have a problem with this - in "The Eternity Code," she takes on Artemis as her Principal because she's explicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowInMyFootsteps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowInMyFootsteps">trying to fill her brother's shoes</a>. She does utilize her own ingenuity (as well as some awesome tricks she picked up from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a> and lucha libre) to become her own fighter, but whenever she is mentioned by other characters, it is always in the context of her relationship to Butler.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Imperial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JediAcademyTrilogy">Natasi Daala</a>, who rose to her position in an Empire that discriminated against women because Grand Moff Tarkin took her as his lover.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeathStar">Death Star</a></em> Tarkin claims that he just allowed her to get past that prejudice and her successes were her own, but this is also the book where he kept having her snuck out to the Death Star for liaisons. And then she got brain damaged, which might explain her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a> in the Jedi Academy Trilogy.
</li><li> Marasiah Fel, the first female ruler of the Fel Empire, got her position because, well, she was in the Fel Dynasty. Pretty obvious that this would be how it works in a hereditary monarchy, but still a clear example.
</li><li> Played with in the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Ysanne Isard</a>, Director of Imperial Intelligence. Her father held that position before her, and she was one of his top agents. She was a bit too good at her job for her father's comfort, who grew paranoid that she might try and take over his job. So he sent her on a suicide mission that would make her look like incompetent, a traitor, or would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">outright kill her</a>. Ysanne noticed, survived, turned the tables on her dad, and had him arrested for treason and executed within an hour of her return to Coruscant (rumor is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">she executed him herself</a>), which earned her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">Klingon Promotion</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">The Emperor</a>. Being psychic, the Emperor clearly knew she was lying about her father but was impressed enough that he let her go through with it.
</li><li> Leia's entire life has revolved around the men in it. She was spirited away to protect her from her birth father, she only got involved in politics and the Rebellion thanks to her adopted father, she first learned of her Force powers through her twin brother, she nearly married herself off to a Prince in order to cement an Alliance treaty, and by the time that she finally settles down with Han and starts a family, her entire life is wrapped around what her husband, brother, or children are doing. She really only comes in to clean up their messes.
<ul><li> On the other hand, when she and Han get married, she's the one who continues her career. Han only comes out of retirement for special occasions, while Leia gets elevated to Chief of State of the entire New Republic, thus heading up a government that spans most of the known galaxy.
</li></ul></li><li> Even Mara Jade, one of the most badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girls</a> there is, has her entire backstory closely tied to the Emperor. Even after he's dead her only goal in life is to avenge her master. Later she becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne">Number One</a> of Tallon Karrde, Luke Skywalker's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, and the mother of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> Ben.
</li><li> Meetra Surik, the canonical protagonist of Knights of the Old Republic 2, is perhaps the most prominent case that averts it to some degree, if not entirely. While she served under Revan in the Maladorian Wars, for the run of the game everything she does is of her own volition or due to the influence of Kreia, her elderly female mentor for learning the Force. There are certainly men in her life but she wields more influence on them than they wield on her. After the events of the game, she teams up with Revan to try and prevent the Sith Empire from coming to threaten known space. Her actions have a major impact on all galactic civilization and after her death, she helps Revan by acting as a Spirit Advisor.

Vittoria of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AngelsAndDemons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AngelsAndDemons">Angels &amp; Demons</a></em> and Sophie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode">The Da Vinci Code</a></em> are only involved in their respective fields because their father-figures were already in them. They're both competent, no doubt, but from the moment they meet the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>, that is all but forgotten. Basically, they're the hot scientists who only get to tag along because the key victims happened to have raised them.
</li><li> Conina of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> does her best to avoid this, fighting her father's influences as a barbarian, and not always succeeding. Of course, since those violent impulses come in handy, it's probably a good thing.
<ul><li> Lady Sybil has aspects of this while also being something of an inversion. She does come from a powerful family, but up until he met Sybil, Vimes had been captain of the Night Watch, only because no one else wanted the job, and he wasn't getting promoted because his mouth kept running away from his brain. Once he met Sybil, he started his way up the ladder of success.
</li><li> Played straight with Susan Sto Helit. Her being Death's granddaughter is her most defining trait and the biggest reason that makes her extraordinary and a relevant character... but then Death is somewhat genderless, so...
</li></ul></li><li> Apart from Galadriel, the women of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> fall into this. Rosie, Goldberry, and Arwen all function as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interests</a> for male characters, and while Éowyn breaks out of the mold eventually, she's introduced as the dutiful niece of Théoden and a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> for Aragorn. She also eventually ends up with Faramir. Still, Galadriel is a hell of an aversion, and her husband is something of an inversion. Quick: without looking it up, what was his name? Thought so. The one line the poor schmuck got in the films was to ask where Gandalf is, and Galadriel corrects him without even bothering to make eye contact.

She is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighClassCallGirl">High-Class Call Girl</a> who gets Belisarius to marry her. She is certainly not shuffled into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">the kitchen</a>, but her achievements are only possible because she has "respectableized" herself by marrying a great general who is willing to treat her as an equal partner.
</li><li> The reason the two female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSistersGrimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSistersGrimm">The Sisters Grimm</a></em> are important is that they're the descendants of the Brothers Grimm.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>. While Katniss is the protagonist and certainly one of the more competent tributes, the game is really about playing to the audience, something that Katniss is incapable of doing on her own. The solution is to deliberately invoke this trope, and pretend that she is the star-crossed lover of the other tribute from her district, the charismatic Peeta. Though played straight in that she gained the skills that make her so competent from either her late father or her male friend Gale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em> centers around an aristocratic society so naturally everyone's success is family. But women are more in the background of vor society, and their main power is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">influence</a> which some vor women know how to wield competently. More odd is Cordelia who in her native land was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldExplorer">Bold Explorer</a> but on Barrayar was satisfied to be a properly maternal if rather eccentric vor woman. Miles is the closest to a self-made character in the series as he made himself a mercenary warlord in an area too far away from his planet for anyone to know about his princely lineage and used that to do covert ops for his native planet until he rose high in power and prestige.

On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBitch">Olenna, the "Queen of Thorns",</a> is no more reliant on her relations than any of the men other than Littlefinger and Varys, and manages to near-openly rule her House with an iron fist, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Daenerys</a> succeeds or fails despite her male connections as often as because of them.

It can also be surmised that at least some of her apparent jealousy at Brienne of Tarth is how Brienne <em>is</em> by all appearances a relatively self-made woman whose family name isn't nearly as important to who Brienne became and what she achieved.

It's also shown that while her father has become an important character, he wouldn't be if not for Ziva.

The first thing we learn about her is that her parents are diplomats, and the audience (and, it's implied, the characters) assume that this is how she got her job. This isn't the case at all, and she remains an important character, which her parents are... not.
</li></ul><ul><li> Subverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> with Parker. "The Inside Job" has her reveal she was adopted and mentored by a legendary (male) cat burglar, Archie, but he's introduced long after Parker's become a well-developed character and only appears in two episodes. Furthermore, she was already a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">Street Urchin</a> and pickpocket when they met, she having first become a thief at the age of 9.

</li><li> This is played so straight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telenovela" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telenovela">Telenovelas</a>, it hurts. Most heroines are defined exclusively by the relationship they have with the male hero, even if the soap is named after her.

Jo is actually quite an effective companion, but she will never be regarded as a high point for the show's feminism (not least because the companions immediately before and after her got their position via their own career).

She's asked to be the keynote speaker at a convention on women in the law business and it turns out she originally got the job at Lockhart &amp; Gardner because she'd dated Will Gardner in law school.

<ul><li> Played with when it comes to the daughters of WWE legends. Expect commentators to go on and on about this and compare them to their fathers. But they also do the same for the <em>sons</em> of legends. It remains to be seen if they'll do the same when the child of a female WWE legend steps into the ring.
</li><li> In the late '90s when females weren't in WWE that much, those who were usually came in because they were dating an existing male star - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable">Sable</a> was with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarcMero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MarcMero">Marc Mero</a>, The Kat with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JerryLawler">Jerry Lawler</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Chyna">Chyna</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a>, Debra to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffJarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a>, etc. As the women's division grew, this was averted.
</li><li> Invoked by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bella Twins</a>, who credit their respective partners - Daniel Bryan for Brie, John Cena for Nikki - for teaching them more about wrestling than they had ever known before. Nikki however refuted this in a 2016 rivalry with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Carmella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Carmella">Carmella</a>, assuring the newcomer that she still earned all her achievements in spite of who her boyfriend was. In the late 2010s, people have also noted that the men gained a lot from their relationships too. Especially Daniel Bryan - who went from indie darling to national celebrity partly thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em> (which he would not have got a spot on if he hadn't been dating Brie). They also did talk up Natalya's help towards them when they were first training, but fans often ignore that in favour of mentioning the men (as that was when the twins went from novelty act to prominent players in the company).
</li><li> A rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> came with Tyson Kidd and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart">Natalya</a>. Due to the latter's success with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TotalDivas">Total Divas</a></em>, a storyline was started where he resented everyone comparing him to his wife's success.
</li><li> In general if a female wrestler starts a kayfabe relationship with a male, expect the commentators to attribute their subsequent matches to their boyfriends teaching them. This was parodied in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>, where The Lovely Lacey was trying to mold BJ Whitmer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs">Jimmy Jacobs</a> into a "better" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a> and Jimmy tried to woo Lacey by using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>, to Lacey's disgust. It was also zig-zagged with Whitmer and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKlein">Kelly Klein</a>, as Klein greatly valued Whitmer and gave him some credit when describing her new training regimen but Whitmer himself rejected the idea and anything else <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSupporter">that implied Klein was less than perfect</a>.
</li><li> A lot of WWE fans like to attribute the success of the women's division in the Ruthless Aggression Era entirely to Fit Finlay - who was their trainer. While he always was known for lobbying for the women to get more time for matches and helped many of them tap into their potential - it's often forgotten that the division still contained veterans like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory">Ivory</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline">Jacqueline</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarleneMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarleneMoore">Jazz</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Molly Holly</a> who were more than capable of putting a match together as well.
</li><li> In a similar vein, Triple H sometimes gets a lot of the credit for the success of the Four Horsewomen in NXT. While he oversaw the good booking that led to them getting more match times, by all accounts it was the hard work of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks">Sasha Banks</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">Becky Lynch</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Charlotte">Charlotte</a> that even convinced him to do so in the first place.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> varies on how good it is with this. On the one hand, there are characters like Lilith, one of the most powerful of the Lunar Exalted, who was initially introduced as having spent centuries in isolation after the death of her husband, and only returning to humanity when she senses his reincarnation. On the other hand, many prominent characters such as the Scarlet Empress, Mnemon, the Roseblack, Anys Syn, and Raksi are quite powerful in the setting, as attained wholly in their own rights (the consorts and husbands of the Empress and Mnemon, although a necessity in their dynastic politics, are basically footnotes, with the latter's ones not even receiving names).
</li><li> The Warhammer universes (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeOfSigmar">Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</a></em>) have comparatively few significant female characters in its background (mostly elves, thanks to their more gender-equal societies), but those it does have tend to avert this trope.
<ul><li> Alarielle the Radiant, Everqueen of Ulthuan, inherited her position and power from her mother's line, as did every Everqueen since time immemorial. Such might be expected of her traditionally feminine earth-goddess aspects, but Alarielle's idiosyncratic belligerence and dynamism in protecting her people seems entirely her own too, and not owed to anyone.
</li><li> Morathi the Hag Sorceress was the wife of Aenarion, first and mightiest of the Phoenix Kings, but her magical prowess, political ambitions, and the hold she has over her son Malekith are entirely down to her own dark obsessions and abilities. Indeed, Malekith owes much to his mother's influence.
</li><li> Ariel, Queen of the Wood Elves, is arguably more influential and powerful in Wood Elf society than her husband, King Orion. They maintain separate courts, and she in no way owes her power to him - both having been invested with divine kingship by the spirits of the forest at the same time.
</li><li> Moving away from the elves, Tzarina Katarin of the human nation of Kislev may have inherited her position as Tzarina from her father, Boris Ursa, but she is only coincidentally remembered as his daughter, and became a far more competent and clever ruler than he was.
</li><li> The Vampire Queen Neferata was far more influential and self-made than her husband, the fairly ordinary King Lahmizzar, and most of the other vampires in her court owed their condition and position to her, not the other way around.

Played with in that it is made clear that being an admiral's child puts a ton of pressure on her to succeed and Tali makes it clear that Quarian Flotilla doesn't have enough resources for the "luxury of sexism" so her gender is basically a non-issue with her own people.
</li><li> This is what Miranda from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> thinks she is. Her father genetically designed her to be "perfect", yet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">Shepard</a> points out that Miranda was the one who decided what she did with her gifts.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> franchise has a few of these: For Jaina Proudmoore and Tyrande Whisperwind, their love triangles are more interesting than what they actually achieve in the conflicts. Alleria and Vareesa Windrunner, while capable fighters, lose all attention to their husbands.
<ul><li> Special mentions go to Jaina Proudmoore who initially averts this trope in the original RTS game but then plays it straight in the MMORPG game, while does she achieve her position as leader of Theramore largely due to her father being the Lord-Admiral of Kul Tiras she was the only human leader to listen to the Prophet and single-handedly hauled what was left of Lorderon over to Kalimdor. In fact, she is even willing to help Thrall and the orc regretfully kill her father if it means to maintain peace between both the humans and the orcs. But then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> she becomes much less proactive and becomes a submissive servant of Varian Wrynn, never questioning his actions nor even try to oppose him even after Varian declares war on the horde. Additionally, much of her time spent is instead on brooding about not being with Arthas causing many of fans who did not play the original Warcraft to perceive her as a shallow love interest of Arthas who does not do anything but watch and weep.
</li><li> Yrel was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">originally conceived</a> as the wife of Vindicator Maraad, who died in the main timeline (hence Maraad <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sacrificing himself to protect her in the <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> timeline</span>) however this was scrapped due to backlash over this trope. Some argue she still qualifies, as in the finished version she starts out as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">somewhat inept</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor">Action Survivor</a> who only evolves into a true leader and badass with a good deal of prodding from Velen.
</li></ul></li><li> The director's cut of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em> added this for Clair and Nel. Their respective fathers used to have the same jobs they did, and this is especially odd since they lived in a matriarchal kingdom.
</li><li> Koei's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiWarriors">Samurai Warriors</a></em> games do this, although it would be hard to entirely avoid as they are set in historical China and Japan, where few women would be able to make names for themselves without being linked to a man. However, the Japanese series is as a whole better at dismantling this trope than the Chinese, since, though their connections to the men are still prominent, the women at least have plenty of interactions with others as shown in the game's sidequests and omake (while <em>DW</em> just flat-out ignores them).
</li><li> Similarly, Capcom's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SengokuBasara">Sengoku Basara</a></em>, with its female cast being mostly defined as being someone's wife or lover and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">mostly defining their characters around their respective men</a>, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">the third game</a> introduced Saika Magoichi as a tough, no-nonsense, badass mercenary woman who is highly regarded by the other warlords. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though the game implies she may have been the protege of the Saika's former (male) leader, who was killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a>. Which would make her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a>.</span> In all honesty, though, most notable women from that period in Japan weren't self-made, being the wives or daughters of influential men.

<ul><li> Eva could be an example of the trope, if only she wasn't <em>solely</em> spoken of as "mother to Dante and Vergil" or "wife of Sparda", or any variation or combination thereof. She's pretty much a blank slate of a character and no backstory whatsoever is given as to what she did <em>before</em> meeting an over-two-thousand-year-old devil, bearing his children, and then dying horribly in a demon attack to save said children. She's pretty much defined by those relationships and nothing else, not counting Trish who is meant to be her clone (and acts nothing like her). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a></em> appears to fill in the gap in Eva's story by making her an accomplished dark witch that fought off the forces of Inferno, but she had to make a contract with a 'Legendary Dark Knight' before that happened.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Rift">Rift</a></em> mostly averts this, but has one major double subversion in the form of Dacia Ultan, the daughter of a clan of renowned artisans. She first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheep">broke her poor mother's heart</a> by setting out to be an adventurer...then brought her family even more honor by <em>kicking more ass than some entire tribes</em>. (It's hinted that the Ultans are now as renowned for their kinship to Dacia as for their crafting skills.)
</li><li> A common complaint about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> is that Professor Juniper is the first female Pokémon Professor to appear in the games, and she's also the first Pokémon Professor stated to have learned her trade from her father, who goes on to have a more important role than his daughter does. Which is a bit unfortunate, given that the character was originally meant to be a male and <em>still</em> have the whole 'inherited trade from father' aspect.
<ul><li> Also played straight by Clair and Janine in the games whom both attain their roles as gym leader because of their male teacher, Lance and Koga respectively, Flannery and Skyla in the anime, and Winona in the manga.

<ul><li> Kairi initially averted it as her status as a Princess of Heart and her backstory living with her grandmother in Radiant Garden had nothing to do with male characters. However, starting from <em>Chain of Memories</em>, the writers started writing her as Sora's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> and nothing more. Although not passive, she has almost no powers of her own, and her main role in the <em>II</em> is to be kidnapped by the male villains and then rescued by the male heroes. She does eventually get a Keyblade of her own, but instead of manifesting it like all the boys, she has it literally handed to her, and she uses it for all of one mostly off-screen fight against random mooks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And even if she is going to be trained to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> by <em>III</em>, she still plays this straight as she gains her talents <em>only</em> because of her new teacher; Yen Sid, though it should be noted the only known female Keyblade Master isn't in any position to be training anyone right now</span>.

This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> in the earliest games; Lara had actually been <em>disowned</em> by her family because they found her globe-trotting adventures, which she undertook entirely on her own, an embarrassment. Only later did they add the idea of her father having been an archeologist too. It's averted for her actual combat/acrobatic skills, which are self-taught.

Otherwise, the game helluva averts this with its other female characters; even Ashe, whose backstory is a stock fodder for yet another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">Faux Action Girl</a> (being the daughter of a king, wife of a charismatic prince, backed by a manipulative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a>) manages to become her own woman by leading said resistance and ultimately the rebellion <em>herself</em>. The lack of anything resembling a romantic subplot in this game definitely helps things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em>A New Beginning</em>, a lot of Dunhill's dialogue mentions the player character's father, who once ran a farm on the same land you're using now, as being the source of their success. It also makes it pretty clear that the male farmer is the default; it's not very flattering as a girl to hear that, from the back, you can easily be mistaken for your dad. Especially if you're wearing a dress and a ponytail. Made even more jarring considering that the developers are well aware that the vast majority of the franchise's consumers are women.
</li><li> Some games, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoonBackToNature">Back to Nature For Girl</a></em> and <em>3</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyColor">Game Boy Color</a>, showcase this trope. The male character's "goal", denoting the end of the game and the point at which the credits roll, is to run a successful business out of his farm. The female character's goal is to get married.

<ul><li> Varrot plays it completely straight: she only becomes a captain because of a former love interest, and resolves not to go through with that motivation because of her current one.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite being the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RememberMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RememberMe">Remember Me</a></em> Nilin falls into this, both played straight, and as an inversion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Her special ability to use the Hacking Glove has nothing to do with her personally, she only has it, and can only use it, because of her father. Her relationship with her mother is at the core of the entire game's events, but it's because that relationship is completely devoid of all emotional connection.</span>
</li></ul><ul><li> Zig-zagged by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>. Technically, most of the characters owe their position in the army to the usually male main character, because the main character recruited them.
<ul><li> A minor example in an optional Spotpass part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>, where characters from previous games appear with a handful of lines. The first lines for Ethlyn and Altena have them introduce themselves as the wife and daughter of Quan, while Quan's son Leif does not mention him.

The title character bears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSacredDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSacredDarkness">the Left Eye of the World,</a> a power that represents the true power of darkness and boosts her own magic several fold. Her father, Balder, bears the Right Eye of the World, which is a light-aligned counterpart to the left. Balder's whole plan in the first game was to ensure Bayonetta reached her full power, and he killed all the other witch candidates save for one that he enslaved. All of this suggests that Bayonetta is only so powerful because her father made her so... until later cutscenes revealed that she received training from Jeanne, against the Umbran Elder's wishes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bayonetta2">The sequel</a> builds on this: Not only was Bayonetta allowed to spar with Jeanne, but we find that Bayonetta's mother was an extraordinarily powerful witch in her own right. Bayonetta inherited her power from <em>both</em> her parents, and it shows.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>
<ul><li> Marge doesn't seem to understand the idea of a woman being successful on her own merits. In "The President Wore Pearls", when Springfield Elementary School teachers dressed Lisa up, Marge said she seemed so successful and compared her to "the wife of a businessman". Also, when the family went to Africa, they found Dr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">Joan Bushwell</a>'s chimp refuge and Marge initially assumed Dr. Bushwell was a man who named the place after his wife. She was shocked when Lisa told her Dr. Bushwell is a woman. It's rather ironic considering there was an episode where Marge became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Woman</a> by opening an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of Curves Gyms.
</li><li> In animated domestic comedies (especially those with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> mom), it is very rare to find a regular or even recurring female character without a familial or romantic relationship to a male character. In particular, the wife in the family (whether she works outside of the home or not) tends to have no friends or connection to the outside world outside of her husband's social circle. Homer Simpson has Carl, Lenny, and Barney. Marge has... Mrs. Lovejoy occasionally?
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>, this trope is explored a bit when Daria and Jodie go to get a loan from the bank to fund a business project as part of a class exercise. The loan officer compliments their business plan and their presentation, but tells them that teenage girls as "high-risk" applicants. He asks if Daria's father can co-sign the loan (because she's white, despite Jodie clearly spearheading their project), until the subject of Jodie's father (a local inventor) comes up, at which point he declares that business savvy is in her blood and agrees to the loan. Outraged by the racism and blatant attempt to gain her father's favor, they walk out and try another bank. Jodie mentions her father's name up front this time and they are offered the loan without incident. Later Daria calls her out, accusing her of falling into this trope intentionally instead of earning the loan themselves. Jodie responds that she just used the tools and connections available to her as best she could. Meanwhile, Helen averts the trope by being a slightly frenzied but seemingly successful high-powered lawyer on her own merit and is presumably supporting the family's finances while Jake's work-life suffers; at the same time, she struggles with feeling like being so focused on her work means she's a failure as a wife and mother.
</li><li> This was a problem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Charmcaster</a> had during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a></em>, as she was constantly working for men (Hex, Zombozo) or motivated by her feelings for men (her father, Michael Morningstar). She is more driven by her own desires in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em>, although she is still sometimes manipulated by certain male characters even then.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>
<ul><li> An interesting case happens to Flame Princess whom initially, enters the plot as an alternative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> for Finn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after his heart has been broken by Bubblegum's rejection</span> along with the Flame King's "evil" daughter. However, over time she began diverging from this trope as she starts having more personality as Finn introduces her to the outside world. All this eventually culminates when she became <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Flame Queen without any input from her father or Finn whatsoever, the former she overthrew while the latter she dumps him for manipulating her</span>. In fact, the last episode where she is featured is "The Cooler" where her entire plot has nothing to do with Finn nor Flame King at all.
</li><li> Unfortunately this is later played straight with Betty Grof, whose entire role and personality revolves around being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Simon's former fiancee</span> and currently the reason she exists in the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> present timeline of Ooo is to find a cure for the Ice King's madness and revert Simon back to his human self</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite the writer's "best" attempts to avert this trope Barbara in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheKillingJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheKillingJoke">Batman: The Killing Joke</a></em> ultimately comes off as this trope played depressingly straight as her personality in that movie comes across as a whiny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> whose only role in it comes across as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Batman</a> without any semblance of independence or heroism whatsoever.
</li><li> The entire first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a></em> is devoted to Harley attempting to defy this trope and step outside of the Joker's shadow after realizing he doesn't view her as more than an abusable minion and the other supervillains viewing her through the lens of this trope. Much of the drama of the season comes from her attempts at overcompensating in the opposite direction and doing things just <em>because</em> she wants to show off how much better she is without the Joker, even if those things do not benefit her own career.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life — Politics </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Generally speaking, many historical women only ascended to power due to the death of their sons or husbands; "Dowager Empress such and such", that sort of thing. Among elected offices, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/28/12319508/hillary-clinton-bill-clinton-dynasty">an article in Vox noted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "a large percentage of women who took their countries top jobs had male family members in high office first."
</li><li> Downplayed by Indira Gandhi, former Prime Minister of India. While she attained her position at least partially because she was the daughter of the influential politician and former Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, she quickly proved to be far more powerful than expected.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryRodhamClinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>. Say what you will about her, but were she not married to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">a president</a>, her chances of being elected to the US Senate (and in a state she never even lived in), nearly winning the Democratic presidential nomination, being appointed to a prominent cabinet post, and later becoming the first woman presidential nominee of a major party would've been <em>at best</em> slightly better than Ralph Nader's, and probably not even <em>that</em> good. On the other hand, many people in Washington agree that Hillary Clinton herself was instrumental in getting Bill to the top, and might have been biding her time until the public was more ready for a woman in power.
</li><li> More than one US state governor used the "back door candidate" method to get around the term limit. The most notorious example is probably George Wallace, who was succeeded after his first term as Governor of Alabama by his wife Lurleen.
</li><li> Of the first fourteen women to serve in the US Senate, many were widows of established politicians. Those who weren't were either appointed to the position or were elected to placeholder, month-long terms. It wasn't until 1980, when Paula Hawkins was elected to the US Senate from Florida, that a woman without a prior family connection in politics was elected to a normal six-year term.
<ul><li> Similarly, the first two women governors — Nellie Tayloe Ross and Miriam A. Ferguson — were preceded by their husbands in office. It wasn't until 1974 when Ella T. Grasso was elected governor of Connecticut that a woman who wasn't the wife or widow of a prior governor was elected.
</li></ul></li><li> The mayor of Las Vegas (Oscar Goodman) was a much-beloved mayor and when he hit his term limit, so the city promptly elected his wife mayor by a landslide.
</li><li> Alaskan tropers will remember that Senator Lisa Murkowski got her senate seat when her father Frank Murkowski left the Senate to become governor and appointed her as his replacement. In the next election, the voters removed the governor's power to appoint replacement senators, though they did give her another term in the same election. They re-elected her <em>again</em> in the next election, despite her name not even being on the ballot.
</li><li> In Canada, Member of Parliament Niki Ashton won her seat at the relatively young age of 26 in 2008 and ran for the leadership of the New Democratic Party in 2011 (although she was unsuccessful). Many of her detractors claimed that she only got that far because of her father's influence, despite the fact that Steve Ashton was a provincial Cabinet minister and was arguably superseded by his daughter's success in federal politics.
</li><li> Partial aversion with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the opposition to the Burmese military junta and prominent peace activist. She accomplished a great deal in her own right, and most people outside of Burma know her far better than they know her father, General Aung San, who is considered the father of modern Burma and was the leader of the Burmese independence movement.
</li><li> This trope is omnipresent enough that when Tsai Ing-Wen was elected president of Taiwan, media outlets pointed out that not only is she Taiwan's first female president, but the first female head of state in Asia not to come from a political dynastic family.
</li><li> When Senator Kamala Harris was chosen as the vice presidential nominee of the Democratic Party in 2020, right-wing media <a class="urllink" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kamala-harris-affair-willie-brown/">criticized her<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for two early political appointments by her then-boyfriend State Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, claiming she owed her political career to him. This ignores that Harris was elected District Attorney of San Francisco, Attorney General of California, and U.S. senator all well after the relationship ended.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder15');">    Real Life — Other </div><div class="folder" id="folder15" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Played straight in English language. Instead of saying "Mr. and Ms. Doe" it is customary to say "Mr. and Ms. John Doe", implying Mr. and Ms. Doe are not equal (which they were if only their surname was announced), but that Ms. Doe exists only as consort to John Doe, her husband. Thankfully, this is falling out of style in favor of "Mr. and Ms. Doe" or "Mr. or Ms. John and Jane Doe".
</li><li> James W. Loewen's <em>Lies Across America</em> mentions a hall of fame in Arkansas where most of the women only get in because they're the wife or daughter of a famous man, thus teaching us that "Men make history, while women make wives". He also mentions several influential Arkansas women that the hall of fame noticeably omits.
</li><li> Ching Shih, one of the most famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PirateGirl">female pirates</a> (and the basis for Mistress Ching in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd">Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End</a></em>) only took over the fleet after her husband died and she married their adopted son. That said, both husbands seem to have been under her thumb completely — we know more about <em>her</em> than them, especially her second husband whom is not really heard from after the marriage. Presumably, he survived the wedding night, but...
</li><li> Some detractors of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LostInTranslation">Lost in Translation</a></em> liked to imply this about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SofiaCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SofiaCoppola">Sofia Coppola</a>, suggesting that her father had somehow pushed the movie to success. Which might make sense if her brother Roman's movie <em>CQ</em> had experienced the same kind of success. There's an article where a movie critic related how, when talking about Sofia Coppola to industry insiders, they always blame Coppola solely for her failures, but attribute any success she has to either her father or the male actors/producers/etc. she was working with.
</li><li> There are unfounded rumors that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KurtCobain">Kurt Cobain</a> wrote Hole's album <em>Live Through This</em> because some people can't seem to accept that Courtney Love might be responsible for her own success in music.
</li><li> In general, before women were allowed to achieve higher education, most women taught themselves however they could, which was usually attached to their husband, reading the books in his library, and often working with him as an unofficial assistant or apprentice. Maria Winkelmann is one example.
</li><li> Pre-modern times, female artists who achieved any sort of fame in their day usually were taught by their fathers. This was certainly true in the Renaissance: <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_Gentileschi">Artemisia Gentileschi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a good example. As a bonus, compare how big her article is to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orazio_Gentileschi">her father's.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Subverted historically by women whose success was attributed to their male relatives or husbands. Mary Shelley, for example, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">novel</a> was published with no stated author, but it had a preface by her husband, so most people assumed that he wrote the whole book. Then the sales of the book dropped dramatically when its true author was made public, and Mary was widely criticized for writing about such an "unfeminine" subject matter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VindicatedByHistory">It would be decades before the book was judged by its own merits, rather than by who wrote it</a>.
</li><li> This was essentially unavoidable for many pioneering women for in order to learn a trade that was considered "men's work" or get higher education before the 20th century, a woman usually had to rely on a male teacher (because there usually would not be a female one around) and often enough on the support of her father and/or husband. Even those women whose mother could have taught them a thing or two about their chosen profession might be unlucky like Mary Shelley, whose mother Mary Wollstonecraft died eleven days after giving birth to her, or Marie-Antoinette of France, whose mother Maria Theresia of Austria ruled an empire, but decided that little Maria Antonia needed less of an education than her elder sisters.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, by a not untypical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>, male prodigies, geniuses, etc. are frequently celebrated as if their achievements had come out of thin air, downplaying or downright ignoring the important roles played by their parents, teachers, sponsors, advisors, etc. A lot of people talk e. g. about the achievements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlexanderTheGreat">Alexander the Great</a> as if he had not inherited his kingdom and the best army in the world from his father and a supernatural mystique from his mother (who put about that Alexander had been fathered by a god and also accelerated his inheritance) as if he had not been educated by Aristotle and been surrounded by experienced and highly competent generals. And how many men's reputation was really diminished by the saying "behind every great man there is a great woman"?
</li></ul></li><li> One stereotype of the modern-day girl gamer (and, so far, the only one consistently seen as a <em>positive</em> stereotype) is <em>"that girl who can kick her boyfriend's ass at Halo."</em> The "logic" being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoGirlsOnTheInternet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoGirlsOnTheInternet">a girl just has no reason to play</a> unless a man coaxes her into the hobby.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergamy">Hypergamy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, or the practice of marrying an older or more established partner is typically associated with heterosexual women, even though historically it was quite common for heterosexual men of lower standing to court wealthy heiresses in the hopes of partaking in their fortunes.
</li><li> Although she evolved to stand on her own, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyLittleLiars">Troian Bellisario</a> knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldBellisario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonaldBellisario">whom to thank for her start</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/news/a62634/sexist-moments-2016-rio-olympics/">Noted<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> about how numerous commentators attributed the success of female athletes to their male coaches or husbands. Simone Biles likewise defied this trope, saying "I'm not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps; I'm the first Simone Biles!"
</li><li> One of the controversies behind some major female-led movies (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OceansEight">Ocean's 8</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters2016">Ghostbusters (2016)</a>, etc.) is that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">female-driven counterparts</a> of male-led movies, and are viewed as such, regardless of quality. In other words, had the male-driven earlier movies not succeeded on their own merits, these female-driven ones would likely never have existed.
