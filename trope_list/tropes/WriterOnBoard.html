<ul><li> In <em>"The Money Pit"</em>, Donald Duck gets the genius idea to start asking to collect his 30 cents an hour from Uncle Scrooges Money Bin, for him to resell the rare coins to coin collectors. Scrooge figures out the scheme, giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a> a chance to rant about "Investment Collectors" amongst comic book fans.
<div class="indent"><strong>Donald:</strong> Those coins aren't doing you any good, and some coin collector will appreciate them. <br/><strong>Scrooge:</strong> That is precisely where you are wrong, nephew! Coin collectors make me sick! They collect their coins because <em>other</em> people put a value on them. They look their old coins up in <em>price guides</em> that tell them the fool things are worth more than face value. But why?! They don't <em>enjoy</em> their coins. They don't <em>dive</em> in them like porpoises or burrow through them like gophers, or toss 'em up and let them hit them on the head. No, they put their coins in plastic sleeves, and are even afraid to <em>touch</em> them for fear they'll be worth <em>less</em> to somebody <em>else</em>! They spend their lives building a meaningless collection that they only plan to someday <em>sell</em>...to a buyer who only plans to <em>resell</em> it! It's all so <em>silly!</em> <br/><strong>Donald:</strong> And I suppose <em>your</em> three-cube coin collection is <em>sane</em>? <br/><strong>Scrooge:</strong> The difference is that <em>I</em> value each and every coin as a personal memento. Nephew, I have learned to treasure that which has value to <em>me</em>, not to someone else. That's what life is all about!
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> writer Keith Giffen is unabashed about his hatred of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> character Karate Kid and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperPower">"super karate",</a> and has stated outright that any time he ends up writing the Legion comic, Karate Kid will die. Once downplayed when Giffen did write Karate Kid's death in one run of the Legion comic, he gave the character a respectful send-off via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, rather than simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">dropping a bridge on him.</a>
<ul><li> A few reviewers have accused Giffen of trying to co-opt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">Midnighter,</a> one of the only openly gay superheroes, after reading their run wherein Midnighter disbands the team, leaves his husband, Apollo, and moves to a tiny apple-pie town where he lives with a young woman named Mindy. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> was pounded so hard after that it nearly <em>cracked</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> has many mostly in the form of Shipping Wars as each writer tries to pitch their own ship:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan "The Man" Lee</a> himself. Particularly his run on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> comics. It's a somewhat well-known fact that, originally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson">Mary Jane Watson</a> was introduced as merely a foil for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILetGwenStacyDie">Gwen Stacy.</a> However, Mary Jane was infamous for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">stealing every scene she entered,</a> largely overshadowing Gwen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlNextDoor">softer</a> personality. Stan made numerous attempts to downplay MJ's character, mainly by simply excluding her from the story, but he once gave MJ a ridiculous haircut that even the characters hated. In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDBonusContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDBonusContent">featurette</a> on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan2">Spider-Man 2</a></em> DVD, Stan admits that despite his efforts, he just couldn't make Gwen as interesting as MJ and he knew it.
</li><li> John Romita is on record saying that he did all he could to make Gwen as interesting as MJ but to no avail. MJ was an immediate hit — readers started writing letters asking for her to be made Peter Parker's girlfriend on the strength of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">the iconic panel that first showed her face</a> as well as her long-introduction and the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Aunt May, Peter's mother in essence,</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> and saw MJ as "the one" for Peter. Lee's and Romita's best efforts to make Gwen prettier and feistier were not enough especially since a lot of these fans didn't forget that when artist and co-plotter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveDitko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveDitko">Steve Ditko</a> was around, Gwen Stacy was a narcissistic arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> who found Peter attractive but was otherwise too proud to act on it and basically played mean pranks and social bullying to "express her affection" and they saw through Lee and Romita's rewrites to make Gwen stick for the transparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a> it was.
</li><li> Dan Slott notes this about the famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revision">Revision</a> of <em>Parallel Lives</em>, the story which revealed that Mary Jane knew Peter's secret identity from all the way back to <em>Amazing Fantasy #15</em>, arguing that it made a "lie of all the stories that came before" and that it made MJ into someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovesMyAlterEgo">who fell in love with Peter because he was Spider-Man and not for just being plain old Peter</a>. Slott said that he disagreed with that change but since it is canon he has to go by it, even if the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GerryConway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GerryConway">Gerry Conway</a> building on work done by Roger Stern and Tom Defalco saw it the other way. Slott referred to this in ASM# 652, where Peter and MJ share a moment talking about Peter's current relationship with Carlie Cooper and why he won't tell her his secret. Peter reveals that he wants to make sure that she falls in love because he's just plain ol' Peter, and not because he's Spider-Man as he feels that MJ did with him. As others point out, that given Spider-Man's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">Hero with Bad Publicity</a> status and the fact that both of Peter's first girlfriends (Betty Brant, Gwen Stacy) uncritically accepted Jameson's views <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">which Mary Jane never did</a>, this amounts to misreading the entire context and shoehorning a sexist Silver Age Lois/Superman dynamic on a setup that specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstructed</a> it, and given that Peter is canonically someone who grew up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressivelyPrettier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressivelyPrettier">handsome</a> (as repeatedly told in stories <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LeeDitkoSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LeeDitkoSpiderMan">in the Ditko era</a>, and shown when Romita made him good looking) and notably rejected Sally Green's advances in college after she praised his brains by insisting that he doesn't want girls to like him just because he's "an egghead" rather than the other qualities in himself he valued. He hasn't been "plain ol' Peter" since he got bitten by a spider and the character who preferred Spider-Man to Peter isn't Mary Jane (as she says in Slott's story Peter and Spidey are one and the same) but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat">Black Cat</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> #154, in which we learn the very important lesson that Beating People Up For Being Gay Is Wrong after Green Lantern Kyle Rayner's personal assistant Terry Berg is beaten up by a group of random thugs while leaving a club with his boyfriend. Despite having lost his first girlfriend to super-villain violence in the incident which defined the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">Stuffed into the Fridge</a> trope and seeing numerous other violations of basic human decency on a daily basis, THIS particularly display of man's inhumanity to man is so bad that it inspires Kyle Rayner to abandon the Earth in favor of wandering outer space and helping random non-human species.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a></em> #44, in which we learn that Oliver Queen's adopted daughter Mia is a recovering meth addict <em>and</em> HIV-positive. Despite having been portrayed by Winick as an unrepentant womanizer and having been so during a time when knowing such things would be vital, Oliver is completely ignorant as to what HIV is and how it is contracted, prompting a text-book recital on how HIV is contracted and treated.

It doesn't speak well of the team that when their leader, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman-trained</a> detective (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a>), is unable to find any leads that his next plan of attack is "Let's get that guy on TV to help us!"

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a></em> #61, in which newly elected Mayor Oliver Queen sums up his plan for rebuilding Star City with two words: gay marriage. In exchange for living in the city for two weeks, gay couples can have a free wedding on the steps of city hall - the hope being that all of these couples will stay and settle in the city, bringing money which will go into the local economy. Sadly, the plan is a bit of a non-starter seeing on how it is dependent on finding gay people who are so desperate to be legally married they will willingly move to a city that is currently divided by a massive wall built to separate the poor side of town from the rich side of town in the wake of a super-villain attack. Ollie does privately admit, however, that the main purpose of the announcement is as a headline grabber, designed to keep media attention on Star City and its problems, and that he doesn't expect it to do much else.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a> has been accused of this, with people saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar">Mark Millar</a> made just about everyone in the Marvel U into idiots just so he could pit them against each other. The fact that some writers seemed to agree with this only compounds the problem.
</li><li> A somewhat humorous example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AnimalMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AnimalMan">Animal Man</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> used it to constantly pitch for animal rights, particularly stating that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Humans Are the Real Monsters</a> and eating animals is wrong. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">Part of the plot was also the fact that the main character was slowly realizing he was in a comic book.</a> In the last issue of Morrison's run, Animal Man and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Morrison</a> talk face to face, and Animal Man points out that animal rights are all well and good - but sometimes he verged on eco-terrorism. And that sharing minds with animals shouldn't automatically make you a vegetarian since half of the time you're going to be sharing minds with a carnivore. And all of this felt like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a>. Morrison admits he has some good points but wonders if the next writer will take that too far and have Animal Man run down a zebra and eat it alive. As both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>, the <em>next writer had him do just that in the very next issue.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JephLoeb">Jeph Loeb</a> appears to have, or at least <em>had</em> at some point, an ax to grind against organized religion. In the famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmperorJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmperorJoker">Emperor Joker</a>" storyline, there's an early scene making fun of a monastery, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> later spouts some atheistic viewpoint towards the end (although granted, this is probably in character for the Joker). Then in the "Return to Krypton" story, the entire point was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Jor-El and an army of scientists fighting against the priestly clan of Krypton</a>. To make the point more glaringly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anvilicious</a>, at the beginning when a time-traveling Jor-El shows up to meet present-day Superman, Superman exclaims "Great Rao!" (Rao is the Kryptonian sun god), and Jor-El moans "No, not Rao!!!"
</li><li> During the latter half of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders">Ken Penders</a>' writing stint on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, many of the stories either revolved around Penders' own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesntLikeGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesntLikeGuns">anti-gun views</a> or would come to a screeching halt for a few panels for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibuster</a> about the same. An example of the former was an entire story devoted to showing how the great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">Overlander</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Mobian</a> war began: two children - one Overlander, the other Mobian - meet between the two kingdoms to play, one of them brings a gun one day and accidentally shoots the other while they're horsing around, war engulfs both races, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">After School Special</a> credits roll. An example of the latter has one of the less scrupulous members of the Freedom Fighters (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fiona, who goes on to betray the team and join the bad guys in a later issue</span>) ask why they don't just use guns to solve their current dilemma and is given a verbal bitch-slap by Rotor Walrus about how they have <em>never</em> used guns and <em>never will</em> use guns. This sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> is made even more jarring by the fact that Bunnie Rabbot, a character that had worn six-shooters holstered in a bullet belt up until the issue in question, can be seen in the background, without the pistols but still wearing the belt. Further, not but twenty or thirty issues previous, Rotor had developed a huge bazooka-like laser cannon that purportedly operated much like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">hand-held</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> and which Rotor actually fired <em>directly at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Dr. Robotnik</a></em> at one point.
<ul><li> His replacement, Ian Flynn, can be just as bad; he has stated several times how much he hates certain characters, and in-comic has either shunted them off to scenarios where they're unlikely to be mentioned again in the main series, killed off, or abused for no other reason but to abuse them (his treatment of Drago Wolf in-comic is a well-known example, though in fairness, much of the fanbase already hated Drago due to his domestic abuse of former girlfriend Hershey).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis">Garth Ennis</a>
<ul><li> He hates superheroes, and with the exception of Superman, Daredevil, and Spider-Man, usually writes them as complete morons. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThorVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThorVikings">Thor: Vikings</a></em> is his best example.
</li><li> He uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> to speak out against US military actions, not a trait of his before.
</li><li> He's also vocally atheist, and many of his stories feature mocking depictions of God.
</li><li> The "Emerald Isle" arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a>: Kev</em> and the "Kitchen Irish" arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherMAX">The Punisher MAX</a></em> are his way of delivering his opinion of the IRA (hint: he doesn't like them).
</li><li> A popular guess among readers is that his views on religion and hero-figures were shaped by his living through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">the Irish religious wars</a>.
</li><li> In an issue of <em>Fury</em>, Ennis has two military commanders inspecting a battlefield. One of them makes an awkward segue into a lengthy rant about the Vietnam War, where he essentially gives the reader Ennis' manifesto on the subject. What's especially absurd is that his companion, a decorated general with enough military prowess to have conquered an entire country, simply responds in disbelief, as if he'd never <em>heard</em> of the Vietnam War.
</li><li> Even when he wrote for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TwoThousandAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TwoThousandAD">2000 AD</a></em>, this was pretty clear, particularly in some of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em> stories, most notably <em>The Muzak Killer</em> which showcases a rant against pop music.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanGrounded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanGrounded">Superman: Grounded</a></em> storyline features Kal-El taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">walking across America</a> to "reconnect" with ordinary people while lecturing them at length along the way. The "walkabout" theme is a deeply personal one for Straczynski, based on a turning point in his own life, and has turned up in his work before (with Dr. Franklin on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>). Those with a suspicious mind might also think Superman's expressed views are mostly the writer's own.
<ul><li> He was also on board for much of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RisingStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RisingStars">Rising Stars</a></em>, the latter half of which was often devoted to JMS lecturing through the Poet.
<ul><li> The latter third of that run was essentially an extended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to rightwing politics, to such an extent that it derailed the existing plot.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Jim Starlin does not like religion, and he writes about it often in his comics. He also has very strong opinions on how some things in comics <em>should</em> be and doesn't mind using the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> to have things his way—the biggest example is his take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewGods">Anti-Life Equation</a>, which is nothing like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>'s. He also once used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a>, Marvel's planet-devouring star god, as a metaphor for U.S. foreign policy.
<ul><li> Starlin also did not like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Robin">Robin</a>, and did everything he could to make the Robin at the time (Jason Todd) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">unlikable</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> J.M. DeMatteis is a strict pacifist writing in an industry that's basically defined by people punching each other. Inevitably, this results in a certain tension when he writes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superhero</a> stories (or his one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelStarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelStarWars">Marvel Star Wars</a></em>.) Either you have a pacifist writer telling stories about violence solving problems, or characters embracing pacifist ideals despite long histories of solving problems with violence.
</li><li> After 9/11, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a> proposed a Batman story called <em>Holy Terror Batman!</em>, in which the Dark Knight hunts down terrorists. DC refused to let him use Batman for the project, which was released as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HolyTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HolyTerror">Holy Terror</a></em> with original characters instead.
<ul><li> Frank really likes two things: Angry, over-the-top sociopathic antiheroes for protagonists, and prostitutes. Male characters tend to have any antiheroic tendencies ramped up, and women are frequently retconned into being prostitutes, strippers, or otherwise heavily sexualized depictions (also often with a helping of sociopathy too). Batman and Catwoman are the most notable examples of that as, in his writing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">Batman is a bullying jerk who regularly insults anyone with superpowers because they have the power to take over the world but don't while spouting homophobic language</a>, while Catwoman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">vague backstory</a> was established as her being a former hooker who, inspired by Batman, adopts a costume to become a masked thief.
</li><li> Frank also has gone on record that he <em>really</em> wanted to do this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>. After 9/11, he apparently told Marvel they were lucky to have a character like Cap who they could use for stories about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> and has made it clear he wants to write the character. Given how he handled <em>Holy Terror</em>, it's a really good thing Marvel knew better.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> has admitted that his series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Promethea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Promethea">Promethea</a></em> was a mouthpiece for his views on magic.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a> in play, though, as Promethea was critically acclaimed for this focus.
</li></ul></li><li> A bizarre and infamous example of this trope appears in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Doom">Doom</a> Comic when Doom Guy suddenly rambles about the dangers of nuclear power and the need to preserve the ecosystem for the children of mankind, in the middle of shooting demons and zombies left and right. Probably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a></em>, though, but who knows...
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> mythos character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Anarky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Anarky">Anarky</a> exists to be a vehicle for his creator Alan Grant's political views. This is why Anarky's ideology abruptly shifted from libertarian socialist to Neo-Tech between appearances (matching Grant's own conversion) and why few other writers use him (one of the exceptions being Kevin Dooley, who himself used Anarky as a mouthpiece for his views on gun control.) In particular, Grant's 1997 Anarky miniseries is essentially a four-issue-long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibuster</a>, delivered via Anarky's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue">Inner Monologue</a>, long philosophical debates with Batman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Etrigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Etrigan">Etrigan</a>, and occasional pauses in the action to allow Anarky to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">break the fourth wall</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster">lecture the reader directly</a> on his alternative view of human history and development.
</li><li> In the early 2000s a new storytelling rule was made at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>: heroic characters could not be shown smoking. The head editor at the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a>, lost his father to cancer brought on by smoking. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, whose love of cigars had in the past been used to deliver an <em>anti-smoking</em> message to those who don't share his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">immunity to their effects</a>, is no longer allowed to smoke.
</li><li> Leo Ortolani, the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rat-Man" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rat-Man">Rat-Man</a></em>, has been reading superhero comics since he was a kid and dislikes manga, in part due to the fear that they might replace superhero comics entirely. Because of this, he has written a couple of storylines (the Master trilogy and Yellow trilogy) which argue that superheroes are superior to manga characters.
</li><li> Rick Remender has been accused of doing this in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UncannyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UncannyAvengers">Uncanny Avengers</a></em>. Remender is outspoken in his belief that the mutant-rights movement within the stories is a poor metaphor for real-world civil rights, because unlike real minorities, many mutants <em>are</em> legitimately dangerous, and several characters within the story express the view that the mutant rights movement is completely different from, say, the African-American or gay rights movements. Particularly controversial has been his handling of Rogue and to a lesser extent Wolverine and Sunfire, who hold the view (shared with the majority of writers and fans) that the parallels <em>do</em> work, and who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">portrayed as unreasonable</a> for it.
</li><li> Like Remender and Giffen above, Jason Aaron's recent Marvel work that involves Cyclops to some extent usually involves at some point or another either Cyclops doing something he views as wrong and being called out on it (usually by Wolverine), or having someone call him out on something he did previously, usually something he did while under Aaron's pen (both <em>Schism</em> and <em>Avengers Vs X-Men</em> being keen examples of such). Cyclops will either give weak defenses for this or he will be cut off by some big speech about why he's a horrible person and why they're much better than him, with him not responding and the scene ending there. In his contributions to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BattleOfTheAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BattleOfTheAtom">Battle of the Atom</a></em>, he even has Cyclops' time-lost teen self remind him and the viewer he's still against his recent behaviour and will stop it (despite the fact that he's since learnt that what he thought about him was wrong) and had Kitty criticize Illyana (who's currently siding with Cyclops), despite both characters actually expressing appreciation for his attempts at helping them <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and having the two leave Wolverine's side to join him</span> in Bendis' parts. In general, if Aaron is writing something X-Men related and Cyclops pops up, he'll be a pathetic jerk who exists to be hated and blamed, and it doesn't matter if the other character ends up coming off as childish, immature, idiotic, hypocritical, or just down-right asinine. Other writers follow suit in order to keep continuity, but they at least give Cyke credence and have him point out what an ass they're being about it.

Never mind that Cyclops has been an X-Man since he was <em>14</em>, or that the X-Men have done this regularly since their inception, <em>or</em> that Wolverine himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">is well known for taking young teenage girls as his sidekicks</a>. Because of the absurdity of this, other writers using his side of the X-Men ignore this and have teenaged X-Men fight in missions regardless, but Wolverine repeatedly makes a big deal about it, even making a point to jab at Cyke for how 'green' his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UncannyXMen">new team</a> were, even though he <em>wasn't</em> taking them out on a mission at the time, and that they were all <em>college-aged young adults</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em> consistently goes into extremely left-wing tracts, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">subtle nods</a> like demons celebrating Margaret Thatcher's election, book-long tracts against nuclear power, or active promotion of hippie lifestyles and crying out for a revolution to bring down "the man".

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FunkyWinkerbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FunkyWinkerbean">Funky Winkerbean</a></em> usually dips only occasionally into Tom Batiuk's views. However, in mid-September of 2009, he suddenly ran a plot line in which a group of angry parents protests a production of <em>Wit</em>, a play about "cancer" and "death". As Batiuk's own dip into these two topics was a source of mockery and harsh criticism (mainly due to his lack of skill in shifting a gag-per-day strip into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">heavy drama</a>), it was pretty obvious that he still had a chip on his shoulder.
</li><li> Johnny Hart became a born-again Christian later in his life, and afterwards <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BC">B.C.</a></em> became notorious for its occasional pro-Christian sermonizing, including one infamous Easter strip showing a menorah transforming into a cross (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> was that this was merely his way of expressing a new religion coming into its own). What made the whole situation rather bizarre was that the strip is ostensibly set in the <em>Stone Age</em>, as the title <em>B.C.</em> would indicate. One fan theory tried to account for this by speculating that it really takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>. After Hart's death his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivedItsCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlivedItsCreator">daughter and grandson took over the strip</a>. They dropped the preachiness and returned to secular gags.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse">For Better or for Worse</a></em>: Johnson's anti-feminism drips from this strip. One example: Anthony convinces Therese to have a baby, even promising to take care of it. However, when Therese wants to go back to her high-paying job, Anthony admits he doesn't want to care for their kid; he expected "maternal instincts" to kick in. Anthony's later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Wangsting</a> over Liz causes Therese to seek a divorce. The other characters view her as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">harpy for wanting a good job rather than staying home and popping out kids.</a>
</li><li> Towards the end of its run, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LilAbner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LilAbner">Li'l Abner</a></em> became dominated by Al Capp's potshots at contemporary celebrities, which alienated many of his Baby Boomer fans and, in the long run, contributed to his once-popular strip fading into obscurity. (Interestingly, although he expressed them less and in a more subtle way during the '50s, Capp's politics were much more liberal then, leading some to theorize that he was simply a contrarian against prevailing social attitudes.)
</li><li> Ken Penders' run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> had tones of this. Penders had a very active fixation on gun control laws and gun safety which he brought into the comic aggressively (which made little sense given the vast majority of the characters never used them in the first place) going so far as to turn accidental gun use as the whole reason for the plot-driving war to start. And then it was all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">retconned away</a> because of his own lawsuit.

<ul><li> Very common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfics:
<ul><li> In the infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyImmortal">My Immortal</a></em>, everyone turns into a goffik Stanist who swears a lot and sticks their middle finger up at preps. They also develop an unhealthy preoccupation with slitting their wrists. However, due to its status as a (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">possible</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollFic">Troll Fic</a>, this ridiculousness is likely quite intentional.
</li><li> There is a fic about Harry Potter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">battling the threat of communism</a>. It had Lucius Malfoy as a communist who was taking over the Ministry of Magic, and they planned to defeat him by... pointing out the fallacies of communism.

</li><li> In many conversion fics, Harry abandons 'witchcraft' and becomes devoted to some monotheistic religion.
</li></ul></li><li> There was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> fanfic wherein 9/11 brought Spike to tears. And not in a jealous "Why can't I be that evil?" way.

</li><li> While labeled as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a> of all things, the story <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6048227/1/APH-Israel-s-Workout">''Israel's workout''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5874478/1/Axis-Powers-Hetalia-Two-Americas">''The Two Americas"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are really very extreme Conservative and racially insensitive propaganda at that.

A good part of the fandom does NOT like how the authors's personal opinions keep seeping into the characterization and the plot (re: Prussia the monstrous villain vs. Austria the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVictim">Designated Victim</a> vs. Hungary the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification">Chickification</a> victim <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> whom Prussia needlessly tortures and rapes to show off his power to Austria</span>; plus Austria is Jewish <em>despite canon all but stating that he's Catholic</em>, paralleling how one of the authors is Jewish too), as well as their rather... arrogant behavior during certain wanks. How the authors both wrote the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a> page for their fics (particularly blatant when comparing it to one of them's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/X2009Epic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/X2009Epic">page on her X1999 epic</a>) and later were caught <strong>monitoring what other people said about the fic online and bullying any dissenters</strong> at the height of the wank days does NOT help their cases.

</li><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/QuentinTarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> film usually has a scene that is obviously a theory or pet peeve of Tarantino's shoved into the mouth of one of the characters. Sometimes even by playing the character himself. Most memorably: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em> features his character rambling about the true meaning of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a>'s "Like a Virgin", and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em> features his character going on a rant about his hatred of cheap coffee.

Ironically, David Zucker would become a hard-line conservative and write <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanCarol">a whole movie</a> on the opposite side of the political spectrum.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnnieHall">Annie Hall</a></em> parodies it, by having Alvy Singer write his failing relationship into a play he's working on. In real life, Singer and his girlfriend break up, but in the play, he delivers a poorly-written speech about how their relationship was far too superb to end in a hell-hole like Los Angeles. Singer lampshades it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">turning to the screen</a> and saying, "What do you want, it was my first play."

In fact, Randall's monologue in the film was an almost verbatim repetition of a speech that Smith had given previously when a Q&amp;A attendee asked him about the trilogy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraKurosawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraKurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a> makes use of this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenSamurai">Seven Samurai</a></em>; Kikuchiyo, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a farmer's son, not a samurai</span>, dissuades the other samurai from blaming the villagers for killing and stealing from samurai in the past; after all, it was samurai rule that had forced them to live that way. This is widely seen as Kurosawa apologizing; he came from a family with samurai ancestors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Revolver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Revolver">Revolver</a></em> seemed set to be the next awesome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyRitchie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GuyRitchie">Guy Ritchie</a> crime film, but what had appeared at first to be a rather promising plot eventually turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>y delivery system for the Kabbalistic beliefs Ritchie picked up during his marriage to Madonna.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a> adaptation of <em>Fast Food Nation</em> is basically a two-hour rant by director Richard Linklater on why people shouldn't eat meat. Bizarrely enough, the author of the book (who isn't a vegetarian) was one of the film's producers.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>'s original mid-1960's screenplay for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Patton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Patton">Patton</a></em>, General Patton's contemporary General Omar Bradley was merely a supporting character; while Patton and Bradley knew and respected each other in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, they were not close by any means. When the film was finally made several years later and Bradley was added as a technical consultant to assist with Edmund North's rewrite, Bradley was suddenly the second-leading character to Patton, they were portrayed as lifelong best friends, and Bradley was often shown as the more reasonable of the two.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive">The Fugitive</a></em> had a case of a costume designer trying to put her beliefs on screen. Actress Jane Lynch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> had one scene in the film as a doctor friend of Richard Kimble.

That was an idea enforced by the director, Jason Reitman, and the intrusion shows. Granted, he did this in order to subvert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">Do Not Do This Cool Thing</a>, but not having a single visible smoker in a film that is almost completely about smoking steers the film straight into... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">a few</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowDontTell">other tropes.</a>

What do you think the odds of seeing this would have been if Spike Lee had not been the director?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HiddenAgenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HiddenAgenda">Hidden Agenda</a></em> is pretty obviously a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against the government of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, going much further than most. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The plot involves a conspiracy where she, with the aid of factions within big business and the military, used black propaganda to discredit Conservative Party leader Edward Heath so she could replace him in 1975.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveStinks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveStinks">Love Stinks</a></em> does this within the plot itself. When Seth gets sued by his ex-girlfriend for "palimony," he expresses his feelings about it through his job as a sitcom writer. This ultimately leads to the actors eventually throwing down the latest script in disgust to chew Seth out for derailing the show because of his personal issues.

</li><li> Aldous Huxley set a new standard for this, as well as acting as an inspiration for later writers such as Rand, Heinlein, and Card. Almost all of his post <em>Brave New World</em> novels feature an author stand-in who lectures the reader about the Way Things Should Be (e.g. Propter in <em>After Many A Summer</em>). This reached its ultimate point of absurdity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Island1962" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Island1962">Island</a></em>, which is essentially a several-hundred-page lecture on the perfect society bookended by a couple of chapters of narrative.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> book <em>The Experiment</em> was ghost-written and a heavy-handed anti-meat screed, so much that the primary author and series creator K. A. Applegate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon">stepped in to rewrite the final chapter so that the Animorphs are happily chowing down on hamburgers</a> (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">Cassie</a>, for whom vegetarianism is in-character). Though Applegate herself doesn't have much room to throw stones, as <em>The Secret</em> is just as much of an excuse to rant about the logging industry.
</li><li> Karen Traviss when she writes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars</a></em>. Her writing on the Jedi tends to be, well, less than favourable, compared to the rest of the franchise. Which is <strong>nothing</strong> compared to her obsession with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia">Mandalorians</a>:
<ul><li> That being said, during her later books before her contract with Lucasfilm was cancelled due to retcons, Traviss did make an attempt to show the inherent hypocrisy of her character's actions. It didn't stop them from being the primary focus of the novels, but she was aware of this trope being in effect and was striving towards fixing things. And before anyone says that her stories are no longer canon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> had the situation covered before her contract had even finished.
<ul><li> Not to mention what happens in <em>Allies</em> and <em>Vortex</em>:<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mandalorians murdering a Padawan, and massacring slaves, respectively</span>. Ouch.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> novel <em>Aspho Fields</em> that she wrote pretty much beats the reader about the head with the idea that "weapons developers = war criminals." Traviss' Mandalorian "super tribal warrior" fixation carries over into the novel as well, with its hyper-competent, misunderstood, absolutely perfect Pesanga warriors, who are pretty much Mandalorians with machetes.
<ul><li> Bonus points? This a setting where these so-called "war criminals" are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">the only reason the human race is still alive.</a></em>
</li></ul></li><li> Her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGlasslands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloGlasslands">Halo: Glasslands</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheThursdayWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheThursdayWar">The Thursday War</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloMortalDictata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloMortalDictata">Mortal Dictata</a></em> novels provide a very alternate perspective on everything we know about Dr. Catherine Halsey and has most of the characters (including characters who were on her side in all previous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> media) treat her like the worst human being who ever lived. Even Halsey herself starts to think this way at times. As far as the author is concerned, stealing children from their parents is the worst atrocity anyone can commit. Even if you happen to save your civilization (and every sentient being in the galaxy) by doing it.
<ul><li> Not to mention that Dr. Halsey's inquisitors are none other than the Office of Naval Intelligence, the very same people who recruited her and approved of everything she did, including the "kidnapping young children to be turned into indoctrinated supersoldiers" part, all to crush what at the time were only human rebellions. Traviss also tries to paint the Director of ONI as a hero, despite the fact that she has done even worse things than Halsey, like approve of the Spartan-IIIs, which were recruited en mass from war orphans and made into expendable commandos by their early teens.
</li><li> This got to the point where <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>'s main writers had to give official explanations in later media like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em>'s prologue for why ONI decided to condemn Halsey in the first place. As it turns out, ONI's problems with Halsey have nothing to do with morality; they just want a convenient scapegoat for the sins of the SPARTAN-II program, as well as to make the SPARTAN-IV Program look better in comparison.
</li></ul></li><li> A more general trend in Karen Traviss's work is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelKilgore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelKilgore">Colonel Kilgore</a>-level obsession with warfare, militarism, and military figures. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> is held as the ideal, and anyone who is not as much of a violent he-man is deemed inferior by the narrative.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDaVinciCode">The Da Vinci Code</a></em> has been criticized for having a protagonist with no personality, who simply serves as a mouthpiece for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanBrown">Dan Brown</a>'s theories. And it's not just the protagonist, either. Brown repeatedly pauses the plot for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">Author Filibusters</a> that would give <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AynRand">Ayn Rand</a> a run for her money, if not in length or research, then certainly in obviousness.
<ul><li> It is helped at least somewhat by the fact that the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> is the main proponent and spokesman of the "secret history", which the protagonist disagrees with over major details. In fact, the filibusters primarily focus on religious ideas and symbols rather than practical facts, often going out of their way to defend the same conservative Christian beliefs they would appear to be criticizing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> ends up being a subversion, and the ending is ultimately ambiguous as to whether the theory is true or not.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Empire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Empire">Empire</a></em>, characters will pause during the action to explain exactly why any disrespect for the military whatsoever is unpatriotic and therefore evil. Not to mention the fact that, despite apparently being a warning against partisanship, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> are still liberals.
</li><li> In one very uncharacteristically blatant and unmistakable example, several characters near the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnderInExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnderInExile">Ender in Exile</a></em> espouse the view that monogamy is the only and best successful means of human society, using the exact same phrasing consistently enough to put conservative pundits' talking points to shame.

For example, the central struggle in <em>Faith of the Fallen</em> is between free-market capitalism and socialism. The main character Richard delivers a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tracts</a> in which he states Goodkind's Objectivist opinions, which often contradict views the character expressed earlier in the series—or even the story's reality itself, such as claiming that belief in the afterlife is unfounded, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">when Richard has been there and back himself</a>. The afterlife thing is particularly noteworthy, since Goodkind's attempt to justify it is more baffling than any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Retcon</a> could be. It is revealed in a later book that since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">the world was devoid of magic for a time</a> the afterlife, magical in nature, has ceased to exist. So <em>now</em> belief in the afterlife is unfounded, even though it could be proven to exist before. This overwhelming change in the world and its profound impact on the human condition is mentioned exactly once, and after that, all the characters behave as if they had always lived in a world where there was no life after death. This is not so coincidentally in line with an Objectivist view, which disbelieves in any afterlife.

Burgess' inspiration for the story was his wife's rape at the hands of World War II deserters, so the desire for an uplifting end is understandable. However, until 1986, the book's American editions left out the offending chapter. Adaptations, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange">film version</a> and the 1990 play written for the Royal Shakespeare Company, also leave it out.

<ul><li> However, at one point the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> has a conversation with the narrator, whom the villain intends to torture to death for fun. They <em>both</em> agree that as evil as the Big Bad is, at least he's not as utterly loathsome and without any redeeming moral qualities as the worst human in recorded history, Vice President Dick Cheney.
</li></ul></li><li> The early works of lesbian author Katherine V. Forrest fall victim to some clumsy all-men-are-evil soapboxing. <em>Daughters of a Coral Dawn</em> is the most extreme, having men (who are suffering from one giant inferiority complex) outlawing some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> that renders them redundant in the act of procreation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum">It Runs on Nonsensoleum</a> (and the precise nature of the phlebotinum is never explained). Fortunately, Forrest appeared to have toned it down by the time she started on the Kate Delafield books.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a>: The Time Paradox</em> by Eoin Colfer. The entire book is about rescuing a lemur from being killed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Extinctionists</a>. Artemis' having sent this lemur to its death is continually treated as a horrendous act, even though he did it in an attempt to save his father. There is virtually no disagreement on this point. Holly is horrified (as are the other fantasy creatures present), Artemis is filled with remorse, and even Artemis' younger self feels a twinge of guilt that apparently never bothered him during any of his other countless criminal escapades. The sheer magnitude of the overreactions of the characters when they learn that Artemis sent the lemur to die makes this an Author on Board.
<ul><li> The series, in general, is fairly loaded to the gills with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesops</a>, with heaping helpings of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a> for good measure. Even amoral characters like Mulch Diggums expressing disgust at how humans are destroying the Earth.
</li></ul></li><li> Since 2001 or so, if the particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> setting allows for it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryTurtledove">Harry Turtledove</a> will include some kind of analogy to Islamic fundamentalist terrorism. No problem on the surface, as analogies are standard stock-in-trade for alternate history stories. The problem came when, in a timeline where the South won the American Civil War, he chose Mormons for this role. Many fans believe that he's crossed the line from "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a> regarding repression of religious expression leading to violence" into outright bigotry. In the same work, he also turns Canadians into Irish nationalist terrorist bombers, blacks into Communists and Mexicans into Nazi satellite state collaborators.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheManWithTheIronHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheManWithTheIronHeart">The Man with the Iron Heart</a></em> takes this to extremes about his feelings on the Iraq War. Reinhard Heydrich lives to run a partisan campaign. Body bags are showing up as everyday Germans become radicalized and engage in terrorist acts. It's subtle as a brick when you have mothers of dead soldiers acting just like a certain famous protester and it leads up to the Republicans winning control of Congress and getting us out from the Democrats' war — after which the Nazis are poised to take over again.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a> tended to do this a lot, albeit that he was somewhat more subtle about it as the characters whom he boarded were created more or less for the purpose of espousing a philosophy central to their characters. He also did it a lot because his <em>modus operandi</em> was to take a source of public fear/apprehension/paranoia and then base a novel around it. Fear of computers/robots: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Westworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Westworld">Westworld</a></em>. Fear of genetic manipulation: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>. Fear of the Japanese: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RisingSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RisingSun">Rising Sun</a></em>. Fear of sex discrimination: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Disclosure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Disclosure">Disclosure</a></em>. Fear of the media and flying: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Airframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Airframe">Airframe</a></em>. And so on.
<ul><li> At the end of his career, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StateOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StateOfFear">State of Fear</a></em> is an anti-climate change screed about environmentalists planning mass murder to cause a climate change panic and receive funding, and when he got called out on his blatant misuse and misrepresentation of science, he turned one of his critics into a child molester with a small penis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Next" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Next">Next</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em> series by Bernard Cornwell gives us the impression that Mr. Cornwell really, <em>really</em> dislikes aristocrats, particularly when they hold military rank.
<ul><li> This is very obvious in his other books, usually aimed at the Church (though generally just its leaders. Various characters, particularly Uhtred get on quite well with the quirkier/better priests/devout Christians, e.g. Fathers Pyrlig, Beocca, Willibald, and Cuthbert, Galahad and Bishop Bedwin.) with it being presented as an often corrupt institution.
<ul><li> Cornwell was raised in a very strict Christian sect called the Peculiar People, who are, well, peculiar. He says his portrayal of religion (individual parish priests=good, hierarchies=bad) is intended to reflect both the historical realities (there were and are good bishops and bad bishops, but the bad ones are more fun to read about) and his views on religion in general: he recognizes the comfort value, communal benefits, encouragement of virtue, etc. but also dislikes the way in which organized religion can become corrupt and self-defeating.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">Older Than Steam</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Moliere">Molière</a>'s plays often were whole essays against the hypocrisy and vulgarity that ran rampant throughout French society, as well as tirades against doctors (medicine <em>was</em> horrible back then, and many physicians were VERY ignorant), pseudo-intellectuals, and self-appointed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>. (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tartuffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tartuffe">Tartuffe</a></em>, one of his most well-known plays, was censored for years because of this.) Characters like Philinte (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMisanthrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMisanthrope">The Misanthrope</a></em>) and Cléante (<em>Tartuffe</em>) serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatars</a> for the playwright.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em>:
<ul><li> While the entire franchise is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a>, the Writer On Board aspect comes into play when a previously independent, scientifically minded character is suddenly touched by God, converts, and from that moment on reminds us repeatedly how happy they are now that they got rid of their delusions and bloated self-importance brought on by education (self-importance through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a> is fine).
</li><li> Another example is how the authors keep trying to cram anti-abortion plot points into a story that starts with the Rapture, an event where every child and fetus on earth magically vanished. Not only are the pro-choice arguments often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw">ridiculous caricatures</a>, but they make even less sense in the context of the story.
<ul><li> Every parent on Earth lost their young children, but Planned Parenthood grief counselors can't find any job except wait for new pregnancies to abort.
</li><li> Neither can the gynecologists, despite the billions of formerly pregnant women who'd need examinations and would want to know if they even can get pregnant again.
</li><li> And the government wants to promote abortion as population control, despite an entire generation having been wiped out overnight.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> William S. Lind, author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em> lampoons much of modern society, in a mean-spirited way. Many characters agree that things went wrong for civilization around the early 1960s, some say the 30s and by the end, the heroes have agreed to restrict their nonmilitary technology to that level. So Victoria flourishes while more advanced US successor states fail.
</li><li> Daniel Silva's books have a lot of this trope. His most famous series is about a Mossad assassin named Gabriel Allon. Silva would spend pages to justify right-of-center Israeli policies while glossing over or justifying any questionable actions by Israel. For example, in "Prince of Fire", several chapters justify Israel's policy of expelling Arab residents during the country's early history. Another thing he likes to go on about is how Europe is basically a giant antisemitic cesspool that harbors Islamic terrorism and how Europe is unjust to push for peace that would be "unfavorable" to Israel. Basically, he tends to portray any country/politicians that are not entirely pro-Israel as antisemitic, which is, of course, a giant fallacy. Silva is a convert to Judaism himself and clearly identifies strongly with Israel due to this.
<ul><li> There's also his dislike for Pope Benedict. He created a fictional Pope who espouses more liberal/inclusive views, not to mention being rather better at apologizing for antisemitism than Benedict has been (this would probably go with the Europe = antisemitic cesspool mentioned above). In the afterword to the book in which that character is introduced, Silva talks about how disappointed he was in the real-life Pope and uses his fictional Pope from that point onward in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> Klaus Mann does this in his novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mephisto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mephisto">Mephisto</a></em>. There is a middle part where the narrative is abandoned for a heated anti-fascist rant and then the novel resumes without breaking stride.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonald" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonald">George MacDonald</a>: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessAndTheGoblin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessAndTheGoblin">The Princess and the Goblin</a></em> is a classic piece of Victorian children's literature. The lesser-known sequel, <em>The Princess and Curdie</em> is a bizarre, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">Anviliciously</a> heavy-handed cross between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePilgrimsProgress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePilgrimsProgress">The Pilgrim's Progress</a></em> and The Revelation of St. John that is likely to give a child unfortunate enough to read it nightmares for years to come.
<ul><li> His non-fantasy novels are even more excessive, often stopping right in the middle of the action to deliver religious sermons (sometimes from the characters, sometimes from the author himself) that can go on for <em>pages</em> in unedited editions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">However</a>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> observed, it's actually alright if we consider that "the author, though a poor novelist, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">supreme preacher</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewVachss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewVachss">Andrew Vachss</a> is unabashed about his condemnation of government and society's failures in his Burke books. These comments are usually delivered through said first-person protagonist, who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> involving precisely that.
</li><li> Stephenie Meyer's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> is rife with allegories to Mormon beliefs despite none of the characters being obvious practitioners. It is one of the reasons why, despite using plenty of romance novel tropes and author-constructs, and having main characters who are teenagers (or are at least in the bodies of teenagers), the main couple don't even think of sex before marriage — despite there being no reason why they would not, given that they have no particular objections to said activity or religious restrictions to follow.
</li><li> Stieg Larsson was obviously not a fan of guns. In a chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMillenniumTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMillenniumTrilogy">The Girl Who Played With Fire</a></em>, told from a veteran policeman's perspective, he criticizes hollow-point ammunition. The character calls it "hunting ammunition" and says that it is "unclear" why law enforcement uses it. A real police officer would be well aware of the reasons, such as reducing the chances of the bullet passing through a target and hitting bystanders, or the fact that <em>shooting someone</em> constitutes "deadly force" and is thus done with the intent of killing the target (hence why it's the last resort for police officers), even if he didn't agree with them. Shortly thereafter, another policeman calls a Colt handgun a "cowboy pistol" and says they should be banned outright because apparently, some guns are somehow "more" bad than others.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeanderthalParallax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNeanderthalParallax">The Neanderthal Parallax</a></em> descends into this, what with the Neanderthals' perfect society that is wholly devoid of crime. Not like us nasty humans, eh? Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiestheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiestheMeans">it's based on sex segregation, plus eugenics -- sterilizing not only violent criminals but their near relatives, and, in the past, those with low intelligence</a>...
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkLordOfDerkholm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarkLordOfDerkholm">Year of the Griffin</a></em> is normally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticComedy">Fantastic Comedy</a> about the trials and tribulations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding University</a> students, it takes one moment in a chapter to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesoptinial</a> about sexism and women's education. Thankfully, rather than disrupt an existing character, it creates a new one—a horrifying misogynist gangster—to serve as its designated vice-target. Since the author has autobiographically noted that she was seen as a weird girl in her childhood for wanting to be smart and intellectual, it's somewhat understandable why she would feel strongly about this.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MaximumRide">Maximum Ride</a></em> series, the fourth book - <em>The Final Warning</em> abruptly switches to a clumsy Aesop about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalWarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalWarming">Global Warming</a>, completely ignoring whatever semblance of a plot and characterization the previous books had. Among other things, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is defeated by a random hurricane, which is explicitly linked to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalWarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalWarming">Global Warming</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CouncilWars">Council Wars</a></em> includes things like cheerleading for the American 2nd Amendment, dislike of welfare, and other political views that at least make sense given the context in which they come up in the story and are worked in logically. Stopping dead to explain why believing in human-caused climate change is stupid, going on at length about the sexual kinks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyStu">Herzer</a>, and a completely nonsensical explanation of American "strategy" in the "War on Terror"? Not so subtle.
<ul><li> Virtually <em>all</em> of Ringo's works feature this.
</li></ul></li><li> In the third book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheAldenata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LegacyOfTheAldenata">Legacy of the Aldenata</a></em> series, <em>When The Devil Dances</em>, a very large artillery piece happens to have been named and decorated after Bun-Bun, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a>. One of the crew members suggested it and talked the commander into it, after introducing him to the comic. They don't have time to consult anyone to see if they'll have to take it off before the fecal matter hits the fan<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2vbm1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2vbm1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2vbm1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yet later on, a general refers to Bun-Bun, meaning he knew about the nickname and decorations, and either didn't care, or <em>actively approved</em>.</span>. Later on in the book, one character refers to "Bun-Bun", and the complete stranger he's talking to knows what he means. He happens to not only read the comic but is a "big fan".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a> does this sometimes, in addition to <em>actually appearing</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsHimself">As Himself</a> to do this to characters in real time. Lampshaded in that he often mocks himself for doing so.
</li><li> Diane Carey's <em>Dreadnought!</em> Star Trek book is, at times, a thinly-veiled Libertarian propaganda piece; government intervention is portrayed as uniformly bad, be it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an admiral trying to use a new Federation starship as the flagship of his private army to cement control over the Galaxy</span>, or socialism as described derogatorily by her human POV character, Cadet Piper and Piper's Vulcan sidekick, Sarda.
<ul><li> All of her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> novels carried some form of this - major characters tended to develop a deep fascination with things of a nautical nature (one of Carey's loves), among other things.
</li><li> She also had a well-documented dislike of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> (no doubt because it was TNG that made it quite clear the Federation is socialist), which was made apparent when she actually was contracted for novels for the series, often finding ways to justify writing around the characters/setting (re: <em>Ancient Blood,</em> separating Worf from the rest of the crew with a B-plot of Picard and Alexander experiencing a Revolutionary War period holo-program, and <em>Ship of the Line,</em> separating Picard from the crew and putting a captain pulled forward from the 23rd century in command of the Enterprise, complete with his own crew taking positions on the ship).
</li><li> She was also contracted to write episode novelizations. Her last one (and last Star Trek novel to date), for the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a>,</em> was actually brought to the attention to Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, the showrunners, who felt that it was openly critical of the script, declaring it to be 'reeking of hatred' for the show.
</li></ul></li><li> It's absent in the film, but if you read the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTreasureOfTheSierraMadre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTreasureOfTheSierraMadre">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a></em> by B. Traven, it seems rather clear that Traven <em>really</em> didn't like the Catholic Church.
</li><li> In an apologetic example of this trope, Glen Gook's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI">Gilded Latten Bones</a></em> contains a scene where playwright Jon Salvation admits it was unkind of him to snub Crash, a young fan of his work and explains what it's like for a writer to keep hearing the same questions over and over. Salvation eventually makes amends by inviting her to attend one of his play rehearsals. Been getting a bit tetchy at conventions and book-signings, Glen?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarlanEllison">Harlan Ellison</a>'s hatred of computers crops up quite a bit in his later work.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IHaveNoMouthAndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IHaveNoMouthAndIMustScream">I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream</a></em> is about as blatant as it gets, too. Ironically, it would go on to be adapted into a computer game which Ellison himself collaborated on.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankHerbert">Frank Herbert</a> clearly had serious issues with homosexuality; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Baron Harkonnen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dune">Dune</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual">Depraved Homosexual</a> who even lusts after his own nephew, and even his henchman Piter is briefly said to have a vaguely feminine personality. Then <em>The Dosadi Experiment</em> features the omniscient narrator discussing how gay people make ideal suicide bombers, an aside that comes right the hell out of nowhere and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">never even has any impact on the plot</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, thriller writer Dick Francis had a thing about sado-masochism: if a character in any of his books is any sort of kinky they are bound to be among the bad guys. This gets so predictable that when one hero has a suspicious character followed and finds that all he's hiding is that he visits a spanking prostitute, genre-savvy readers are ready for it when he turns out to be part of the evil conspiracy after all.
</li><li> It doesn't stick out as painfully as most other examples, but you can easily use the collective <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> to teach a child about the basic values and ethics of secular humanism. It's more obvious in the more serious novels like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Hogfather">Hogfather</a></em> or the later Watch novels, but subtly permeates the entire setting and standard narrative. Note for example how the only people ever truly condemned and removed from society for the greater good are obvious sociopaths — other types of antagonists get some chance of redemption and are depicted as just misguided or scared or stupid, but not outright evil. And the gods are there to be mocked, not venerated; or in the case of truly benevolent higher powers (like Death), they don't care what people believe. And basic human (dwarvish/trollish/undead/etc.) kindness and decency always, always wins the day in the end. All this is no real surprise, considering that Sir Terry was an outspoken member of the British Humanist Association.
<ul><li> The only way for a religious figure to be depicted positively is for him to rebel against his religion and tell his god, in effect, "Fine, we'll worship you but we don't want you to do or say anything ever again" or accept that Granny Weatherwax is right and the best use for his holy book is as firelighters. Similarly, when Cohen meets The Lady in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastHero">The Last Hero</a></em> he gets to give her, personally, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> that renders her dumb (although, ironically, it was Cohen's poorly-thought-out revenge plot that stood to doom the entire Disc right down to the Turtle itself).
</li><li> This also goes double for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em>, even if that's obviously not <em>secular</em> humanism.
</li><li> There's also a strangely subverted example involving gun control. At first glance <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MenAtArms">Men at Arms</a></em> appears to be an unusually heavy-handed diatribe against gun ownership, to the extent that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is in fact <em>the gun itself</em></span>. However, later books have a considerably softer outlook on the issue; Sam Vimes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em> even espouses a version of the pro-gun proverb, "If guns are outlawed, then only outlaws will have guns."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> series has a particularly uncomfortable section where he inserts his own real-life incident of being hit by a reckless driver into the plot. Not only does he use the actual real name of the person who hit him, but he also spends a considerable amount of time demonstrating and discussing that the driver was an absolute inbred moron that had no business driving on the road. This is especially awkward considering that the driver had died the year after the accident, which was before this section was written. Supposedly, King had expressed sorrow at the man's death, so it's unknown why he was determined to demean him in his later book.
</li><li> Early installments in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeMacDonaldFraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a></em> series depict the protagonist as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">lecherous, lying coward</a> who somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">comes out on top</a>, accompanied by a jaundiced view of British imperialism. In later books, however, Fraser <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">makes Flashman more sympathetic</a> (or at least less craven), play up the Empire's righteousness and takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anvilicious">potshots at liberals, "political correctness" or modern society in general</a>. See for instance <em>Flashman and the Redskins</em>, with its long prologue of Flashman calling out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">liberal whining about mistreatment of the Sioux Indians</a>. Most egregious is the final book, <em>Flashman on the March</em>, which celebrates the British invasion of Abyssinia as an example of a moral foreign intervention in contrast with, say, the Iraq War.
<dl><dd><ul><li> Though most people who knew Flashman as his readers know him would listen to his moral advice...and then immediately take the opposite position. Even when he's at his most sympathetic, it's still a consider-the-source issue.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> This regrettably carries over into Fraser's other works. His memoirs <em>Quartered Safe Out Here</em> and <em>The Light's on At Signpost</em> are loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">take thats</a> directed towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">modern, multicultural Britain</a>. Even his last novel <em>The Reavers</em>, set in medieval Scotland, evinces a similar attitude. Fraser became an arch-Tory later in life and increasingly let it bleed into his writing.

Tolkien</a> makes a number of pointed comments through his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TolkiensLegendarium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TolkiensLegendarium">Legendarium</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>.
<ul><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesops</a>, celebrating the countryside and agriculture and deriding mechanization without care for the natural world, is particularly prominent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> with the tree-shepherding Ents: "I am on nobody's side because nobody is on my side." Saruman's crimes include the ruin of the park in Isengard and the wanton destruction of the ancient trees in Fangorn Forest as much as his assault on Rohan.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>. The Dead Marshes are based directly on his memories of flooded battlefields in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and he was still working on the books when <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWarII">World War II</a> broke out and his son went to fight. When there's a direct comparison between Rohan and Gondor (made, admittedly, by a Gondorian), Rohan is shown as less wise because they embrace the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> ethos, glorying in battle for its own sake, whereas Gondor only slid into that due to necessity and it's not good for their culture. Beregond also laments that Faramir should be more admired but because he's scholarly and only kills at absolute need, people think that Boromir (who was more like the men of Rohan) was better. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProphecy">The Prophecy</a> concerning Aragorn's return is about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a> rather than his prowess in war.
<ul><li> The other issue with the Rohan/Gondor theme is that the Rohirrim are early Anglo-Saxons with horses, closer to the native culture than the culture after Christianity (Tolkien thought the conversion was an improvement). The Numenoreans, of course, are a superior race in every regard, including <em>and particularly</em> genetics (Tolkien originally meant Eowyn to marry Aragorn but decided she wasn't worthy of him [!]and sort of slapped Arwen in at the last moment). Part of his wise Numenorean/barbarian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> Rohirrim dichotomy is exactly that: he viewed the native Germanic culture as barbaric, and that culture is one of the best real-life examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There is also a pointed dig on both themes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> in Goblin-Town: "It is not unlikely that [goblins] have invented some of the machines that have since troubled the world, especially the ingenious devices for killing large numbers of people at once [...] but in those days and those wild arts they had not advanced (as it is called) so far."
</li><li> His Catholicism also drips heavily into his work. In particular, the Valar are effectively a way to show Middle-Earth cultures as essentially polytheistic, while also showing monotheism as "correct." His later writings on the Elves essentially show them as Catholic on a <em>biological</em> level; for one, non-marital intercourse is somewhere between disgusting and physically impossible for them. The Oath of Feanor (the primary plot driver for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>) is derided not simply because of its murder-happy consequences, but because Feanor and his sons blasphemously swore it to God.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross">Charles Stross</a> seems to have a lot of anger against superhero fans in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAnnihilationScore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAnnihilationScore">The Annihilation Score</a></em>.
</li><li> In just about anything by Robert Heinlein, sympathetic characters are constantly giving lectures which essentially push the author's views. Obviously, whether this is a good or bad trope depends on how you feel about the specific concept being espoused. Unrestricted all-American capitalism, the charm of cats, the poor knowing their place, the evils of religious dogma, incest, free love, the superiority of the "down home" values prevalent in the US in the first half of the 20th Century, chivalry and politeness, how wonderful babies are, the need to encourage scientific education - all of these things are constant preoccupations of characters in his work. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement">No comment will be made as to whether any of these individual tropes are good or bad</a>, but that they are most definitely constant preoccupations of the characters very much illustrates the trope.
</li><li> The characters in L. Neil Smith's alt-history novels (<em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheProbabilityBroach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheProbabilityBroach">The Probability Broach</a></em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGallatinDivergence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGallatinDivergence">The Gallatin Divergence</a></em>, etc.) are all mouthpieces for the author's brand of libertarianism. Plus, they get to shoot anyone who disagrees. Way cool.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnGreen">John Green</a> has admitted Van Houten's pro-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">Death of the Author</a> views in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaultInOurStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaultInOurStars">The Fault in Our Stars</a></em> are essentially his own (though he hopes he's less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> about it).
</li><li> Thriller author Brad Thor does this on occasion, but <em>Hidden Order</em> is one of his most blatant examples of this. It begins with special operations expert Scott Harvath suddenly taking on the role of a freelance investigator looking into a series of serial murders, and breaks down into a scree against the Federal Reserve, who to no one's surprise, turn out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the story, eventually getting to the point where the narrative gets shoved aside for a character to become a mouthpiece for Thor's views on the Reserve for a chapter and a half.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> makes it abundantly clear what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a> thinks about any number of issues. At the start of the series, Haven is the antagonist, and explicitly a welfare system is taken to absurd extremes. The need to provide for masses on the dole makes them turn conquistador. One character later internally ponders at length how Haven's education system turns out poorly trained soldiers because it focuses on "validating" the students rather than really teaching them. The evils of socialism and flat taxes are also discussed. Nearly all star nations have capital punishment, the bad guys included, and it's always done by hanging. Abortion is also considered unethical, though it's obsolete now as babies can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UterineReplicator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UterineReplicator">"tubed"</a>. Both Conservatives and Liberals are initially not portrayed well (some good examples come about later), with the protagonists being centrist. This makes sense as the series also pushes what are usually more left-wing views, like sexual liberation and women's rights.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a> frequently used his novels as pulpits for his social commentary. He was famously critical of poverty and child labor owing to his own childhood experience working in a factory to help pay his family's debts. This is most overt in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOldCuriosityShop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOldCuriosityShop">The Old Curiosity Shop</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OliverTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OliverTwist">Oliver Twist</a></em>.

<ul><li> Most episodes penned by the Berman/Braga team, as they have the opinion that the future is going to be a bad place, taking the franchise away from Gene Roddenberry's vision of hope and optimism. While it has sometimes worked when taken as a whole (the latter seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>, for instance, were quite good—and Braga had nothing to do with the series), taken individually many of the episodes are rather dark, depressing, and pessimistic. Not quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">downer endings</a>, but definitely not the "Let's explore space and have fun!" endings that Roddenberry's episodes typically possessed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> himself may also be listed here.

Gene's atheism has been portrayed in several Star Trek episodes and movies here and there, but most prominently in "Who Watches the Watchers", where several Enterprise crew members strongly denounce religion as superstition and imply that they view it as nothing but a roadblock to progress. This attitude is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">never seen again in any Star Trek episode</a>.
</li><li> Jeri Taylor is often accused of this since she often wrote episodes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Janeway</a> being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> and how everyone on the ship loved her. In a Taylor-made episode in which Janeway apparently (but not really, of course) died, the crew had a memorial service in which <em>every</em> cast member made a speech about how awesome Janeway was. This scene was twice as long as Spock's funeral in <em>Wrath of Khan</em>.

Fine for modern-day folk at home, but in a ruthless, medieval setting it produces an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> who prefers endless slaughter to killing the one man responsible for it. The most glaring example is early in Season 1 when Robin's reluctance to just <em>shoot</em> the Sheriff (who is about <em>ten feet</em> away from him) causes the death of one of his <em>own men</em>.

There's also an unflattering reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaroldWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HaroldWilson">Harold Wilson</a>'s resignation honours list and the Doctor espousing anti-politics views.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> was all about this trope, particularly in the Ninth Doctor's run, where most episodes had a criticism of some sort.

"Rosa" was co-written by Malorie Blackman, who is known to base her stories around the subject of racism.

<ul><li> Highlighted in the extreme in <em>Law &amp; Order: Trial By Jury</em> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DickWolf">Dick Wolf</a>'s negative views toward defense attorneys who were at times portrayed as more immoral than their clients (who were all inevitably guilty). But the polarity of the integrity of the DA's office vs. the sliminess of defense attorneys can often be seen in all of the Law &amp; Order series.
</li><li> Curiously subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> where Elliot Stabler enjoys his rants about how violating his morals is evil and horrible.
</li><li> In an instance that might be called "Actor On Board", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em> has Detective Sergeant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/JohnMunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/JohnMunch">John Munch</a>, whose utter devotion to the civil liberties of every human being stops rather abruptly at the right to end one's own life. This character is played by an actor (Richard Belzer) whose own father committed suicide, as did Munch's in-universe, thus explaining this inconsistent stance. Munch in one episode attempts to explain his feelings because of this to the assisted suicide advocate (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarleeMatlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarleeMatlin">Marlee Matlin</a>) they've arrested, convincing her not to kill herself on a hunger strike.
</li><li> One particularly blatant example: Stabler and Benson are investigating an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">attempted castration</a> when they discover the victim made parts for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrone">military drone planes</a>, and speculate that the controversy surrounding said planes could be a motive. Said possibility is ruled out in <em>the very next scene</em>, but not before Benson tells the guy's wife point-blank, "Your husband kills people for a living!" This angle is then never mentioned again.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">The Mothership's</a> original cast seasons (before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">network-mandated</a> cast overhaul and before the show settled into its standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyOfTheWeek">Body of the Week</a> format), any crimes with a sexual angle (that weren't rape) were treated with visible disgust by both the senior detective (Phil Ceretta or Paul Greevy in those seasons). Ben Stone would tend to be more professional about things - unless the porn industry was involved somehow, then the moral gloves came off. The biggest example of the latter may be "Aria" (Season 2, Ep. 3), where Stone prosecuted a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a> for the suicide of her daughter: she killed herself rather than perform a hardcore sex scene, and Stone charged her with having driven her to it via pressure to perform. The porn pros were all portrayed as sleazy borderline criminals or victimized women with various substance abuse problems.

<ul><li> In general, JMS tried as hard as he could to avoid shilling his own views, and present both sides of an argument with no judgment calls made by the episode itself (though the actual characters involved generally had <em>very</em> strong views). Ironically, this often had the opposite effect. For instance, he got hate mail for the first season episode "Believers," with people claiming it was either blatantly pro-religious or blatantly anti-religious. No complaints to be had on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the blunt killing off of the cute kid</span> in that episode, though.
</li></ul></li><li> A very early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, "Emancipation", was centered on Samantha Carter becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit">Blithe Spirit</a> on a planet where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWomansLand">women were oppressed in every way possible</a>. The feminist message was conveyed with all the subtlety of a naquadah explosion, and it wasn't exactly the show's best episode. The events from it were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">never mentioned again</a>.
<ul><li> Carter had many moments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFeminist">Straw Feminism</a> in the early seasons that later became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a> — her infamous reproductive organs speech from the first episode is a prime example (Amanda Tapping apparently told the writers, 'yeah, women don't actually talk like this'), and if you're only familiar with the show through later episodes it's quite jarringly out of character.
</li></ul></li><li> The earlier seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds">Weeds</a></em> would toss in several ostentatious diatribes against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W.

Not just a few little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take Thats</a> here and there; the writers would practically pull the handbrake on the story just so they could whine at-length through a character's mouth about how much they hated him. The best(worst?) example being the kid winning a debate competition by using Bush's name as his sole argument against the Electoral College; his teammates, his opponents, the judges, and the entire audience <em>all</em> cheer him on in agreement.
</li><li> Most episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BostonLegal">Boston Legal</a></em> involve at least one case where the Crane, Poole &amp; Schmidt firm takes on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGovernment">The Government</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> over a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a> controversial scandal or policy. Guess who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">always wins</a>?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Numb3rs">NUMB3RS</a></em> suffered from this with the eco-storyline and the minority-treatment arc at the end of last season. Nothing like a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Green Aesop</a> to pull the handbrake on a perfectly decent whodunit.
<ul><li> In fairness to the writers, this was during a period where just about <em>all</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PrimeTime">Prime Time</a> tv shows had some awkward and obvious addition of greenness to it; being uber earth-friendly was like the chickenpox for all the major networks, with many of the networks forcing the green line on the people who made their shows.
</li><li> Also in line with the trope, at many various points the main characters talk about what they're doing to be eco-friendly, up to and including building a windmill in the backyard for power and including a filter-collector for rainwater.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:

Prominent examples are the episodes "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E4BeautyAndTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E4BeautyAndTheBeasts">Beauty and the Beasts</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E15Consequences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E15Consequences">Consequences</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E6WildAtHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS4E6WildAtHeart">Wild At Heart</a>". A lot of her episodes tended to feature males as villains or be the bad character in a relationship. It gets so extreme that Willow's reaction to Oz's cheating comes off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">not quite as sympathetic as intended</a> considering what Willow was doing with Xander the season before.
<div class="indent"><strong>Willow</strong>: And you know, what happened with Xander, it doesn't compare. Not with what you and I had. Not with whatever you've been doing with her.
</div></li><li> Not to mention the tendency of anything remotely resembling a Christian (with the exception of Riley — whose religion is given in a throwaway line, holy water and crosses — which are never explicitly stated to be Christian) in the series to be either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Sinister Minister</a>, or some other form of evil, reflecting a prejudice that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> is at least honest enough to admit to; he joked in one interview that he was doing it to undo the work of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Why would the producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dallas">Dallas</a></em> make an entire season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> just to bring back one character? Answer: They didn't. Executive producer Leonard Katzman wanted that entire season retconned out of existence because he's misogynistic and hated that the women on the show had been made into much stronger characters during his absence from production. Bringing back Bobby Ewing was just a bonus.
</li><li> Many people believe the famous/infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a> episode "Forever Red" was essentially used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">Promoted Fanboy</a> Amit Bhuamik to force his fanfic hoax "Scorpion Rain" into canon with the series. Although actually, Bhuamik only provided the voice of Tommy in the fanfic, which was actually created by Derik Smith. Still, Bhuamik admitted that he considered the fanfic "completely in canon" when writing Forever Red, taking advantage of what was originally supposed to be a sequel to Countdown to Destruction (but got changed due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> from Jonathan Tzachor and Koichi Sakamoto) to put his old friend's fan works into continuity.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a>'s</em> writing staff comes off as aggressively atheist. Jack refers to religion as superstition and rants about how primitive cultures cling to anything that denies the randomness of existence. It's repeatedly stated that there is no afterlife, and anyone with a belief in some form of deity is shot down as naive or just wrong. There's also the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">Everyone Is Bi</a>. The series was created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a>, who also wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk">Queer as Folk</a></em>, and is openly gay along with being atheist.
<ul><li> In series one, a number of the people the team resurrected had memories of darkness and a hungry thing which turned out to be quite literal, real, and verifiable (and, at one point, summoned into the living world). This wasn't a minor plot point, either; it was the first series arc, making every character around before series 2 that says something like "this life is all there is" something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a>. Admittedly the Torchwood afterlife is apparently extremely <em>boring</em>, but nonetheless.

"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlakesSevenS4E2Power" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlakesSevenS4E2Power">Power</a>" featured a war of the sexes and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">uncharacteristic sermon</a> from Avon — usually an equal-opportunity misanthrope — about how he, as a man, would always be stronger than a woman.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanAlda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanAlda">Alan Alda</a> began writing episodes for the later seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> and the show tended to become his personal soapbox when those episodes were aired.
<ul><li> "Peace on Us" — Hawkeye steals a jeep and runs off to interrupt the peace talks. At no time in the episode does Colonel Potter get upset with Hawkeye for going AWOL and pulling such a stupid stunt. Instead, the unit throws a party. Even worse, the General that Hawkeye confronts at the peace talks seems to be on his side as well, letting him off with a slap on the wrist and a hinted agreement at what Pierce had done.
</li><li> "Images" — Getting tattoos is stupid and regrettable, not to mention unhealthy. Hawkeye doesn't like tattoos and BJ, Charles, and Potter all agree with him. Slightly moderated in that the tattooed character who inspires Radar to get one is not portrayed in a negative manner, and it is argued (correctly) that a tattoo should only be created in a sterile environment, something far from guaranteed in the back room at Rosie's Bar.

In the Battlestar Galactica podcast, Ronald D. Moore admitted that he was engaging in this trope with these two episodes, but that he basically didn't care.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> did a brief story arc in the third season where Beiste was being abused by her new husband Cooter, it was quite clear that the whole thing was orchestrated by NeNe Leakes, the actress playing Roz since domestic violence is her pet cause. Besides the fact that Beiste's Aesop of "Big burly people have feelings too" had been run into the ground in the second season, the storyline resulted in out-of-character moments for almost everyone involved, from Cooter—previously portrayed as a nice guy—suddenly becoming a wife-beater offscreen<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3iec7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3iec7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3iec7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, it's truth in television that most abusers come across as nice people in public, but from a narrative standpoint, it came out of nowhere</span>, to the girls of New Directions acting completely nonchalant towards Beiste's plight and claiming that their own boyfriends would never hit them (even though two of the girls in the group were dating each other), necessitating Roz to set them straight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>: The reason why the story with Phoebe and the stray cat exists is that Marta Kauffman (one of the show's key writers) lost her own mother just before work on Season Four began. Normally such a plot would have been rejected, but because of the circumstances surrounding Kauffman and her mother's then-recent death, the plot was allowed to slip past the writers' room.
</li><li> All the characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em> go out of their way to express the fact that homeless people, prostitutes and other kinds of transients and vagrants are still people worth helping and protecting just like those who do have their lives in order. Given recent cases like the Robert Pickton trial, where police were criticized for not treating the cases of missing prostitutes as urgently as they should have, this could be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeAnvilsNeedToBeDropped">Some Anvils Need to Be Dropped</a>.

</li><li> Roberto Gómez Bolaños aka <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Chespirito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Chespirito">Chespirito</a> was a very complex man. On one hand, he was very socially conservative and a vocal opponent of abortion and gay marriage (though he was OK with gay civil unions) but much more progressive on economic issues and social reform, probably because he was a devoted Catholic.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4bngg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4bngg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4bngg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Notice that is very common in Latin America for political Catholicism to be left-wing in political and economic issued but more conservative in social issues, as most Christian Democratic Parties would show.</span> His views went into his shows in many ways:

</li><li> Since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">being condescending</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie">outspoken about her beliefs</a> was partly built into her characterization, Lisa Simpson has frequently been used as a mouthpiece on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, though she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">frequently acknowledged as being annoying to those around her</a>.
<ul><li> In an example of Guest Star on Board, Paul and Linda McCartney only agreed to appear in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E5LisaTheVegetarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS7E5LisaTheVegetarian">Lisa the Vegetarian</a>" on the condition that Lisa remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series. On the other hand, Paul and Linda end the episode by telling Lisa that even if she doesn't approve of other people eating meat, it <em>isn't</em> okay to force them to change or shove her own vegetarian choices down their throats, so there's that.
</li><li> Writer John Frink seems quite politically liberal, as two rather intense political episodes of his show. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS15E21BartMangledBanner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS15E21BartMangledBanner">Bart-Mangled Banner</a>" is an over-the-top straw man caricature of what America's political culture is supposedly like during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWBush">George W. Bush</a> years, while "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS23E10PoliticallyIneptWithHomerSimpson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS23E10PoliticallyIneptWithHomerSimpson">Politically Inept, with Homer Simpson</a>" is a similarly unsubtle denunciation of the Tea Party as a movement of mindless morons. Though the Simpsons obviously always dabbles in political commentary, these two episodes are infamous for swapping the show's trademark cynicism in favor of partisanship.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Transformers: Beast Machines</a></em>. The author outright admitted that he deliberately ignored aspects of the prequel series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> because he wanted to "tell his own story", as opposed to, for instance, an actual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> story. The result wasn't pretty; near-universal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> is just the start of the problems. For the most part, he acted as if this were a completely new series, and not a sequel to another.
<ul><li> Though it's undoubtedly a fact that Bob Skir derailed almost all of the Beast Wars characters, the matter cannot be entirely blamed on him alone. On his website, Skir admitted that Hasbro specifically hired him because he had no prior experience with Transformers and they even ordered him not to watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>. Bob Skir receives the most flack for Beast Machines because out of all the writers and producers on the show, he was the one who made himself the most accessible to the fans (which resulted in him having to cancel a Botcon appearance due to death threats). Others such as Marty Isenberg and many other writers on the show received no such backlash from the fandom, even though they played an equal part in making Beast Machines what it is.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> has, in later seasons, become nothing but a vehicle for Trey and Matt to dispense whatever magical wisdom they feel obliged to share with us.
<ul><li> This goes beyond politics. For example, there have been <em>two</em> episodes that express their disapproval of George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.
</li><li> Also Cartman's promiscuous mother is named Liane after an ex girlfriend of Trey's who he walked in on having sex with another man (and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalTheMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalTheMusical">Cannibal! The Musical</a></em> Packer's faithless horse who gets ridden by the entire town is called Liane).
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS7E14Raisins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS7E14Raisins">Raisins</a>" was another result of the above incident.
</li><li> Even more blatant in the whole arc of the 20th season, where Trey and Matt heavily relied on the presidential elections, to the point of being forced to re-write at least one episode from scratch after the IRL elections results showed up.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle">BIONICLE</a> 3: Web of Shadows</em> deliberately jerked protagonist Toa Vakama <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">out of character</a> for the entire movie, because the writers thought that him becoming a traitor would be more dramatic than, you know, someone to whom it might have made sense to play that role. So they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">derailed him</a> to be more reckless, foolish (the exact opposite of how what he was like in the previous movie) and dangerously misguided (... again), and the other characters consequently acted meaner toward him. Also, this fit in well with their plans to make the movie one giant <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">Homage</a>. Greg Farshtey, Bionicle's main writer, detests this story to this day.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RalphBakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a> films, the mafia are almost always portrayed as outright scoundrels with no redeeming qualities. Bakshi grew up in the kind of gritty, low-income neighborhoods that the mob controlled and hated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a></em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotDoThisCoolThing">seemingly glorifying them</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Ironically the film's producer, Albert S. Ruddy, would later work with Ralph on his third film,</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coonskin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Coonskin">Coonskin</a></em>.
</li><li> A light example in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WanderOverYonder">Wander over Yonder</a></em> episode "The Cartoon". Hater tries his hand at animation and fumes, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreWriters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MostWritersAreWriters">Animation is hard work! People who do this for a living deserve more respect and credit!</a>" It's done rather tongue-in-cheek, as he's really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery">hamming it up</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">looking directly at the audience</a>.
</li><li> Just like <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> can engage in this at times; one of the most blatant examples is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS7E3Decision3012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS7E3Decision3012">Decision 3012</a>", which is about a Presidential candidate (who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> in all but name and ethnicity) who is portrayed as a messianic genius who could save the universe if only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw">the drunken idiots of America and Fox News</a> (which is somehow still around 1000 years in the future) would stop obsessing over minor things like his "foreign-sounding" middle name and just let him do his job. Unsurprisingly, it's near unanimously considered the series' worst episode.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E14FameAndMisfortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS7E14FameAndMisfortune">Fame and Misfortune</a>" is seen as mostly a retort against criticisms of the show by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheralDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheralDemographic">Peripheral Demographic</a>. It's really telling that even people who like this episode tend to only defend the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">potshots it takes at fans</a> and you would honestly be hard-pressed to find people actually praising or even commenting on the near non-existent plot itself. In this case, the writer on board isn't the actual writer; M.A. Larson, who wrote the episode, has gone on record saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the executives ordered him to write the episode</a>, and he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">disowned the episode due to them not allowing him to make the episode less mean-spirited</a>.
</li><li> It'd be easier to count the times that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> <em>doesn't</em> use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">Compressed Vice</a> to say exactly what the writers opinions are on the subject ("Thoughts and Prayers" actually being with a character outright stating that that gun violence is the literal direct result of violent movies), especially when it comes to feminism, which is rarely challenged if even questioned (If it is, it's usually by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Straw Character</a> and thrown away). The show has actually been accused of its seemingly careless use of other, more controversial topics as a springboard for a feminist agenda, such as one episode where whales in captivity are used as a metaphors for how sexist and dehumanizing strip clubs are.
