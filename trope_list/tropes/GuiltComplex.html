</p><p>A person with a Guilt Complex is someone who routinely puts blame on their own shoulders. It differs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> in that whatever happened cannot possibly be their fault. Their justification for blaming themselves is usually a stretch. Sometimes, a <em>ridiculous</em> stretch, to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a>; the person offers such bizarre, nonsensical, and completely off-the-wall reasoning as to why it's their fault that there's either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">a lot of drama and angst</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">or a lot of derisive laughter</a> to be had from it.
</p><p>The Guilt Complex differs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologizesALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologizesALot">Apologizes a Lot</a> in that it's not just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a> or a way of expressing sympathy for someone else; they truly believe if they had done <em>something</em> different, whatever negative situation they were in would never have happened. And they feel this way <em>all the time</em>, in all situations, to the point where it basically becomes one of their main character traits. Often takes the form of "I should have..." or "If I hadn't..."

</p><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormats</a> who are so used to being blamed for everything that they've started to believe it's really their fault.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause">Martyr Without a Cause</a> who subconsciously tries to shield their True Companions from hurt by taking the blame themselves, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">The Heart</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Moms</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamDad">Team Dads</a>, and characters who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a>.
</li><li> Characters with lingering, unresolved guilt stemming from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">their greatest failure</a> (which is more likely to actually <em>be</em> their fault), when said failure hits them so hard that it pervades every aspect of their life and they begin to believe every failure around them is their fault, as well.
</li><li> On rare occasions, it may be a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation">Heroic Self-Deprecation</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">Byronic Heroes</a> who feel they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">responsible for everything that happens around them</a> just because they're protagonists.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> "Catholic Guilt" is a stereotypical personality trait of practicing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunsNRosaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NunsNRosaries">Catholics</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedCatholic">former Catholics</a>.
</li></ul><p>Expect the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> to initially try and make this person see how they are not at fault until it happens again, and again, and again, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">again</a></em>, and in the end induces much eye-rolling, resignation, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> from other characters.
</p><p>If a character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">indulges in this</a> a little <em>too</em> much, it's not uncommon for a supporting character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuitYourWhining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuitYourWhining">to snap them out of it</a> by accusing them of <em>arrogance</em> for the attitude. Expect to see something along the lines of "you think you're the only one [responsible for/saddened by/involved in] this?!"
</p><p>Often instrumental to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">It's All My Fault</a> where the character usually says this to the point it becomes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltComplex">Guilt Complex</a> trait. Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>, the inversion of this trope.
</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> When you add examples, try to give as much detail as possible. Remember this trope is about a behavioral <em>pattern</em>.

<ul><li> Miranda Lotto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>. She has a massive inferiority complex from being bullied by everyone in her hometown and constantly told she's useless. She goes out of her way to be helpful but feels she can't do anything right and relentlessly blames herself for pretty much everything that goes wrong. "I'm sorry" and "I should have..." are the things you hear her say the most. Also, she's the team's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">Barrier Warrior</a>, and often thinks she doesn't do a good enough job of protecting her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>. Her powers allow her to heal even the most fatal wounds...but only temporarily, any injuries that she heals returning after she deactivates her Innocence. Thus, you can expect her to try and leave it on for as long as possible, even when it's obviously taking a toll on her, and then apologize profusely when she's finally forced to shut it off..
</li><li> Quatre Raberba Winner of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>. Believing that peace is possible without fighting, he nonetheless pilots one of the few Gundam suits in the galaxy, forcing him into wars. He's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologeticAttacker">Apologetic Attacker</a> who constantly tries to get his enemies to surrender without fighting, which always fails, and carries around the deaths of the people he kills heavy on his mind. Teammate Duo Maxwell once said that if someone were to ask Quatre why there's no air in space, "Quatre would say it's because he didn't work on it hard enough."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>: Shinji Ikari suffers from this, mostly born out of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a> personality clouded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> from both his parents. Though Shinji doesn't say it loud, it is obvious that he (at least, subconsciously) blames himself for being abandoned by his both parents (though it never was his fault, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his mother did it as part of a hidden agenda to turn him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bomb</a> and his father feared being a bad influence and cut himself out of Shinji's life under the misguided belief that <em>he was doing his son a favor</em> by staying away from him</span>), and it really just gets worse from there. It's his fault Touji's sister got hurt because he should've been more careful when fighting the angel that almost killed him, it's his fault Asuka is screwed because he is unable to help her, it's his fault <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he had to kill Kaworu</span> because he could've chosen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>... He becomes so wracked with guilt that at <em>End of Evangelion</em> he refuses to make anything for fear of screwing it up... and as a result <em>everything</em> (Misato's death, Asuka's extremely bloody and painful death, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>...) becomes HIS fault.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>: Himura Kenshin's Guilt Complex started from when he was a very young boy never quite got over the idea that he doesn't deserve to live— not only is he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a> for the numerous people he killed, but he has a ton of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt">Survivor's Guilt</a> over being the only one who lived through the bandit attack in which he met his mentor— and it took a long, long time for him to break out of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> ways. His fame as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Hitokiri Battousai</a> means that many of his old enemies come looking for him and many people get hurt in the process. Hence Kenshin blames himself every time someone he cares about gets hurt in these altercations, even if they willingly put themselves on the line. Eventually this prompts him to leave Tokyo, leaving all of his friends and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Kaoru</a>) because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">It's Not You, It's My Enemies</a>. Kenshin also blames himself for the death of his first wife, Tomoe. Granted, she <em>did</em> die by his sword, but as she threw herself in between him and his enemy in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, it was never Kenshin's intention, and since he was by that point blinded by pain and blood from previous battles, there was no way he could've seen her until it was too late. Tomoe herself certainly did <em>not</em> blame him at all. Tomoe's little brother went insane as a product of seeing his sister die. Therefore Kenshin also blames himself for this, and indirectly for every horrible deed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Enishi</a> brings about in his quest for revenge— effectively everything that happens in the last <em>eleven volumes</em> of the manga. It isn't until the very end of the series that Kenshin began to forgive himself, and believe himself worthy of finding happiness.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> Vash the Stampede is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a> who believes that "there are plenty of ways to save everyone"; i.e. no matter how bad the situation looks, there's always a way to resolve it without anyone having to die. So, naturally, whenever anyone <em>does</em> die a violent death, he blames himself for not finding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Third Option</a> in time.
</li><li> Syaoran from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle">Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-</a></em>. He blames himself for pretty much everything that happened, because of his decision to rewind time when he was seven. This includes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sakura being taken away by Fei Wong Reed, Fai's being born a twin and therefore being a cause of misfortune, Kurogane's mother's death, and Watanuki,</span> most of which happened before he was born. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Probably</a>. He blames himself because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> implies that his rewinding time gave him free rein, but in reality it was his only option; he was pretty much manipulated by Fei Wong Reed and had no control over what Fei Wong did making use of the altered timeline, and there is no way the poor kid could've known all the ramifications that were possible from his one wish, anyway. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Heck, even the readers don't quite understand all the ramifications</a>.
</li><li> Sango from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>. She blames herself for her undead little brother being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>, for all the deaths he causes and for not being able to hate him and therefore kill him to stop him. She also blames herself every time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Miroku</a> is poisoned or injured.
</li><li> Jellal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> lets people pretty much beat the crap out of him without complaint out of guilt for his past actions.

The most notable example of this would be the deaths of the Moonlit Black Cats, which, to this day, he blames himself for.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> lives and breathes this trope:
<ul><li> Usually of the type "If only I had gotten there sooner" or "I should've known this would happen" when there was no way he could've gotten there any sooner and there was no way he could've known this would happen. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">the media blames him for everything</a> doesn't help matters either; it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the series that whenever something bad happens, Spidey immediately starts remarking that somehow he'll wind up being blamed for it by the media. His Guilt Complex is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> many, many times.
</li><li> Uncle Ben's death? His fault, he could have stopped the thief earlier. Gwen Stacy's death? His fault, he killed her when he fired a webline to stop her plunging off a bridge. J. Jonah Jameson has a heart attack? His fault, he never should have asked for the back pay the Bugle owed him... You get the point. Sometimes, his guilt is justified (Aunt May getting shot by a sniper, for example), and of course this only adds to the complex as is.
</li><li> It gets to the point that in an early issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a></em> when he finds out that Electro caused a supervillain prison break, he starts blaming himself for the riot since Electro is one of "his" villains. Luke Cage immediately points out how ridiculous that is because if Electro refused, someone else would've been hired to do the job.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ImAMarvelAndImADC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ImAMarvelAndImADC">I'm a Marvel... and I'm a DC</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Batman:</strong> Don't you know, [Spider-Man] blames himself for Marvel losing the Transformers? <br/><strong>Hulk:</strong> But why? <br/><strong>Batman:</strong> I don't know, he blames himself for everything!
</div></li><li> One particularly ludicrous example comes from the 90s cartoon series, where villain Morbius changed into a vampire due to an accident experimenting with Peter's blood, which he obtained by breaking into Peter's locker. Peter considers this his fault. Okay, yes, a school locker isn't the best place to keep radioactive blood, but seriously Peter, grow a damn spine.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ImAMarvelAndImADC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ImAMarvelAndImADC">I'm a Marvel... and I'm a DC</a></em> example: Peter manifests two personae, one for the Spider-man Trilogy movies, and the other for the <em>Amazing</em> reboot. They fight with each other, insulting their respective movies, which threatens to harm Peter's consciousness. Batman convinces Professor X to force both personae to blame themselves for their movies' failures. After they take terms comforting each other, they realize their movies' mistakes aren't their fault, they reconcile, saving Peter's consciousness.
</li><li> The "No One Dies" arc in Dan Slott's run heavily examined this trait of Spider-Man. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Martha Jameson</span> is killed by the Spider Slayer, Spidey experiences a nightmare where he's tormented by visions of <em>everyone</em> who's ever died on his watch, from famous deaths like Gwen Stacy and Ben Reily to single issue and background characters like the kid from "The Boy Who Collects Spider-Man". Spider-Man blames himself for every death that occurs around him, even if he couldn't possibly have helped and the result is some who is strongly implied to be a borderline mental wreck, wracked with PTSD and self-loathing. Afterwards, he promises that nobody will <em>ever</em> die when he's around again; this ends up making his guilt complex even worse, culminating in a near breakdown in "Ends Of The Earth" after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the suicidal Rhino deliberately kills himself and Silver Sable just to spite Spidey by breaking his promise for him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>,</em> Matt Murdock's friend, Foggy Nelson, was beating himself up for something, and Matt told him, "Foggy, you would blame yourself for the Battle of Bull Run if you could find a way to do it."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> Batman suffers from this. Dick gets shot? Blames himself, fires Dick to protect him. Babs gets shot? Blames himself, doesn't show his face to her. Jason gets killed? Blames himself, becomes violent and careless. It doesn't help he <em>constantly</em> keeps Jason's memorial case around to <em>constantly</em> remind him of his perceived failure to save him. When Dick took over as Batman, he decides to move the case, and finds out that <em>Bruce put files of the murder of <strong>Dick's parents</strong> into it</em>. Dick even wonders to himself just how deep Bruce's self-flagellation goes. Bruce has been like this since he was <em>eight</em>. Parents get shot? Blames himself, dedicates the rest of his life to crimefighting and sabotages his own relationships because he genuinely believes he doesn't deserve to be happy.
</li><li> Bruce's adopted daughter, Cassandra Cain, has this to a perhaps even greater degree. She basically considers her life utterly worthless because her abusive father forced her to kill a man at the age of eight, and routinely blames herself for any life, even those of villains, that she fails to save. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> Barbara Gordon tries her best to convince her that the bad things happening around her are not her fault, but her success is limited.

After Tony regained his sobriety and joined Rhodey and friends in a new venture in California, Rhodey began experiencing debilitating headaches and fits of rage toward Stark while in the armor. When nobody could come up with a medical or scientific explanation for the headaches, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Henry Pym</a> referred Rhodey to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight">Shaman</a>, who sent Rhodey on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">Interdimensional</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionQuest">Vision Quest</a>. Here, Rhodey confronted his own soul and came to realize that the headaches were caused by his own guilt; he had enjoyed being Iron Man and didn't want to lose it, but deep down he believed he'd stolen the identity from Tony, and this conflicted with his loyalty to his friend. Only by being willing to give up the armor was he freed from the headaches.

He has a deep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroComplex">Hero Complex</a> and as the only practicing Wizard in the Chicago area, he feels responsible for taking care of any supernatural situations that arise in town, and feels guilty whenever he's not able to do so, especially if people he cares about get hurt. This behavior goes all the way back when he killed his adoptive father and mentor, something which has plagued him since, even though he knows he did it in self-defense, and it was his only choice. Harry often stretches things very far in order to blame himself for things. In book 3, <em>Grave Peril</em>, Harry feels responsible for taking the Nightmare down, and guilty for whatever other attacks it commits, just because it's <em>his</em> power the creature is using for these attacks, regardless of the fact that it took that power by force and in a setting where Harry had absolutely no control: a dream. (He's started to get better about it - it took working with years working with Murphy, leading the Alphas periodically, and teaching Molly for him to finally start to comprehend that other people make their own choices too.) Bob lampshades his Guilt Complex:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Bob:</strong> <em>(Scoffs).</em> Harry, that's irrational. <br/><strong>Harry:</strong> <em>(Snaps at him).</em> That doesn't make it any less true. <br/><strong>Bob:</strong> <em>(Meek).</em> Okay. We now have left Reason and Sanity Junction. Next stop, Looneyville.

He blames himself for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Voldemort coming back to life</span> because it was <em>his</em> blood that was used in the spell, never mind that it was taken by force.

Mappo crosses half the world to find Icarium, all the while descending into blaming himself for the attack, the subsequent separation, for being such a shoddy guardian that the Nameless Ones had to replace him, for lying to Icarium about his true purpose for centuries, for believing the Nameless Ones in the first place, for loving his friend too much to leave him for eternal imprisonment despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tykebomb">Tyke-Bomb</a> status, for looking noble despite being selfish, and eventually for every unrelated little thing that happens along the way, like several of the caravan guards he paid to accompany him dying of occupational hazards.

Most of these things were not his fault at all, but being in a privileged position (not only is he the leader of Torchwood Three, but he also can't die) makes him feel responsible for the lives of those around him. He blames himself for the 12 children that were sacrificed in 1965, even though that was a government decision and he was only chosen for it. He blames himself when the other members of Torchwood are targeted by the government, because they're only wanted due to their involvement with him, to cover up his involvement in 1965. He blames himself for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ianto's death (and everybody else at Thames House), even though the 456 would have likely killed everybody they could even if Jack hadn't stood up to them. He had to sacrifice his own grandson and he blames himself for it, even if it was the only way to save the world from the 456.</span> It's also revealed that he blames himself for earlier events, like Suzie's death (which he couldn't have stopped, as she killed herself the first time, and the second time she was killing Gwen to keep herself alive), his brother's torture (even though he couldn't have done anything to save him, they were just kids) and every action Gray took because of it, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tosh's and Owen's death at his hands.</span>

He is then hit repeatedly during the series with it; he considers the death and/or personal injury of anyone helping him in his quest to be his fault, no matter if they were helping of their own free will (Scully) or were involved in the conspiracy long before he came on the scene (Deep Throat). It doesn't help that others place blame on him, too. When a clone claiming to be Samantha appears and then is kidnapped, Mulder's father blames him explicitly. Mulder offers to tell his mother, and his father tells him the news will devastate her. Bill Scully (Dana's brother) meets Mulder while she is undergoing treatment for cancer; Bill rips into Mulder for all that has happened to his family—mainly Scully's cancer and Melissa's death, which he perceives as Mulder's fault.

When he aborts a rescue of a young boy on a Skaro battlefield upon realizing he is Davros, future creator of the Daleks, Twelve comes to believe he is <em>directly responsible</em> for the Daleks' existence and is willing to die to atone for it (in the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he realizes he is the one who saves the boy after all</span> and has nothing to be ashamed of). When the brave Viking girl Ashildr accidentally dies in helping him defeat the alien Mire waging war on her village, he is so grief-and-guilt-ridden that he revives her with alien tech that makes her functionally immortal — which only leads to more guilt as she comes to resent him for "trapping" her in a lonely existence; she becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a>. And he believes himself to be only a negative influence on his companion Clara Oswald, which culminates in "Face the Raven": <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Clara attempting to save a friend from an unjust execution leads to <em>her</em> unjust death instead</span>; to make matters worse, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ashildr had a hand in the plot that led to this, though she meant Clara no harm</span>. The Doctor blames himself as well as his enemies, and between that and being imprisoned in a giant torture chamber <em>immediately afterwards</em>, he undergoes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a> who will <em>risk the universe's existence</em> just to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> save Clara...whether she wants that or not</span>. Even when he's assured that Clara's fate was the result of <em>her</em> choices and not his fault at all, it takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Clara herself</span> to convince him to give up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream">Tragic Dream</a> born of his anguish.

</li><li> The title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> spends his eternal life repenting for all the people he killed when he was soulless. To unpack this, he blames himself for the acts of the demon that possessed his body after he died and until his human soul was shoved back in. The <em>Buffy</em> mythos is very clear that the vampire is <em>not</em> in any way, shape, or form the person whose body it inhabits, even though it inherits memories and personality traits from that person. He often broods, and David Boreanaz's prominent brow comes in handy. He is relieved when Cordelia lets him stay in his office and pretend to read while she goes out on a Friday night.
</li><li> Guinevere from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em> has one, blaming herself for things that aren't even remotely her fault (such as her brother's kidnapping and the blackmail that ensues). Most recently she extracted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromise">a promise</a> from Lancelot to protect Arthur, little knowing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was on a mission to heal a rift in the spirit world by offering himself up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">blood sacrifice</a></span>.

While a number of the things that go wrong in the show ARE his fault and he does some terrible things, he will almost always blame himself even if they are not his fault. This stands in complete contrast to many other characters. Most importantly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">it contrasts him to the protagonist and his mentor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Walter White</a>, who almost always claims <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>, no matter how horrific his actions become, until the last three episodes.

However, he blamed himself for the incident and thus never told anyone the details, which probably would have helped lift a good portion of the blame from his shoulders. Later on, he blames himself for not achieving his dream and making it into SOLDIER, then blames himself for not waking up from a vegetative state (brought on by four years of experimentation and torture) fast enough to save what was at that point his only friend from being gunned down on a cliff.

</li><li> The title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> regularly takes more responsibility for things than he should, blaming himself for everything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">the ocean being stolen</a> by Lapis Lazuli in the episode "Ocean Gem" ("I was the one who let Lapis out of the mirror. It's my fault the ocean's gone.") to Ruby and Sapphire having relationship issues in "Keystone Motel" ("I don't understand, is it... Is it me?"). However, this is most present regarding his belief that he has to shoulder the blame and responsibility for all of Rose Quartz's (the former leader of the Crystal Gems, and Steven's mother) many, <em>many</em> actions during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">the Gem War</a>, with him spending several seasons believing that she gave birth to him for that precise purpose; his father eventually manages to convince him the latter isn't true in "Lion 4: Alternate Ending", while Amethyst outright states that his mother's failures aren't something he or anyone else is obligated to fix in "What's Your Problem?"
</li><li> Adora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> blames herself whenever someone she cares about is hurt or captured; this stems from her childhood, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent">Shadow Weaver</a> would, while hurting Catra, chide Adora for allowing Catra to do whatever inspired this particular punishment.

Meanwhile, Catra has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">the opposite problem</a> until receiving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">Breaking Speech</a> a season later.

He continuously blames himself for everything wrong in people's lives. For example, Sarah Lynn is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddledAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddledAddict">Addled Addict</a>? His fault, he could have been a better influence on her. Hollyhock overdosed on weight loss drugs? His fault. He thought it was a good idea to give his mom "one more chance". He also thinks he's "ruined" the lives of the people he hurt, such as Penny, when in reality, she was fine. In fact, she only showed signs of trauma again after she saw BoJack again in his abortive attempt to apologize to her. He also goes on and on about how he's a poison and how he destroys everything.

<ul><li> Responsibility OCD, also known as <em>hyperscrupulosity</em>, is this trope in spades applied to anxiety disorders. Basically, the individual suffering from it fears not protecting others from harm and lives with constant feelings of guilt or anxiety.
<ul><li> Moral OCD is very similar, and if it arises in a religious context is often called just "scrupulosity". The fears tend to focus on being sinful, immoral, or harming other people directly, but cause the same continuous guilt and worry.
</li></ul></li><li> Overblown feelings of guilt are a common symptom of depression and are partly the reason a) the condition is so hard to overcome and b) depressed people are so bloody annoying to family and friends. Accepting that <em>it's not your fault</em> is a big step to recovery.
</li><li> It's also a frequent result of emotional abuse. One of an emotional abuser's most common tactics is blaming their victim for everything that goes wrong in order to guilt the victim into staying and trying to atone for everything. It's infinite indentured servitude on a purely emotional level.
<ul><li> Similarly, it can be a victim's method of escaping abuse - by immediately laying the blame on yourself, you potentially escape being the abusive behaviour that would done to you this time, or at least lessen it. Which, unfortunately, often becomes this, as if you repeat something enough times, your mind will start to believe it even if you consciously know it isn't true.
</li></ul></li><li> People with Aspergers Syndrome and other forms of Autism can be like this, often due to some kind of combination of the above three points; anxiety, OCD, and depression are common co-morbid conditions and autistic people are very often victims of bullying or abuse. A fair number of autistic people end up being blamed for their poor social skills and any problems that arise from it, made worse when people assume they're doing it on purpose or should otherwise know better. Noted in the book <em>Aspergirls</em> (which was written by and contributed to by autistic women), which has an entire chapter called <em>On Blame and Internalising Guilt</em>:
<div class="indent"> There is always going to be some internalization of blame. Most of us, whether we care to admit it or not, have a considerable amount of embarrassment and shame to contend with - for not being able to handle the little day-to-day, ordinary experiences that other women seem to handle just fine.
</div></li><li> And true to the trope, all of those factors mentioned above can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation">Heroic Self-Deprecation</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologizesALot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApologizesALot">Apologizes a Lot</a>, and oddly, acting like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>. This is odd because the people suffering from the above normally haven't done anything all that wrong, and unless suffering from the aforementioned horrible emotional abuse, have no reason to think they have.
