They're often eager, even desperate, to prove themselves, and they won't take it well if their attempt fails.

<ul><li> Prussia, America, and England of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> all have shades of this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>:
<ul><li> Miura often seems unshakably confident in his opinions about the direction Mashiro and Takagi should go, especially his belief that gag manga are more likely to maintain their rank than serious manga, but in his thoughts and around his fellow editors, he's less certain of himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">blaming himself for</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Detective Trap getting cancelled</span> and believing that he has to get a hit out to keep his job.
</li><li> The biggest example of the series is Aiko Iwase, who thinks she is better than anyone else and trashes manga in comparison to literature. When she meets her rival Takagi, who isn't a professional mangaka at the time, but he does not give a fuck about her already being an infamous author, she's quite shocked to learn that the Weekly Shonen Jump sells multiple times more than her books do, so she starts becoming a mangaka to surpass Takagi. At first, her manga becomes very popular, since her partner is the young genius Nizuma, but when the quality of her story goes down, she is stuck in a crisis, until fellow mangakas motivate her to continue her manga again; since this point, Iwase mellows out of her icy ego.
</li></ul></li><li> Chang Ho from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/TheBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhwa/TheBreaker">The Breaker</a></em>, at first, appears to just be a random bully who really doesn't have a reason to harass the protagonist Shi Woon, going so far as to nearly make Shi Woon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>. However, near the end of <em>The Breaker</em>, and early in the sequel, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheBreakerNewWaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheBreakerNewWaves">The Breaker New Waves</a></em>, the reason becomes clear. Chang Ho is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">abject failure</a> in <em>everything</em>. Beating up Shi Woon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">and getting away with it</a> was the only thing he was good at. Once Shi Woon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">is strong and skilled enough to defend himself</a> Chang Ho completely loses it and becomes downright desperate to beat Shi Woon, and anyone close to him. He goes after Sae He, trying to gang-rape her. When that fails, thanks to Shi Woon's reckless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a>, and he ultimately gets his ass handed to him, he joins "Soldiers Under Command" and happily swallows their lies about him being "the <em>True</em> disciple" of 9AD, along with a bunch of experimental drugs, like the Illwundon, and was actually willing to die, rather than admit that Shi Woon is actually a better fighter, never mind a better person in every way. It doesn't excuse his behavior by any means, but it does explain it to some extent.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10</a></em>, Nanakuma is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">tsuntsun</a> and extremely haughty, but it's because he's afraid everyone thinks he's the inferior twin and he's desperate to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">surpass his brother as a result</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLivesOfHighSchoolBoys">Daily Lives of High School Boys</a></em>, Girls-only Sanada East's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">Ringo-chan</a> only started to have an extremely large ego as she noticed how the boys-only Sanada North has a far more well-run student council.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> Light seems to be living his life under the assumption that he has to be <em>perfect</em>. Perfect student, perfect son... and then he kills two people by accident just to satisfy his curiosity and his boredom. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">That ruins everything.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">It makes him a murderer, evil</a>. The only way to become "perfect" again is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZerothLawRebellion">to become Justice</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">to become God</a>. In his own words, "If Kira is caught, then Kira is evil. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">If he wins and rules the world, Kira is justice."</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">He gets caught</a>. As per the trope, at times he comes off as desperate to prove himself—especially in his interactions with L, where he seems to get overly-excited even when he gets simple answers right. And "feeling better about themselves by putting others down"...does the <em>whole world</em> count?
</li><li> Mello is a more typical example of the trope—though Light does count. Ranked second best at a school for genii, Mello is motivated by his <em>raging inferiority complex</em> which drives him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">do whatever it takes</a> to prove he's number one and beat Kira and Near. He grows up from being the slighted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">school bully</a> into becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">a terrorist mafia lord</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>: Ken Ichijouji during his stint as the Digimon Kaiser/Emperor. While he claimed to be the "only perfect human being", and frequently called other people derogatory epithets like "maggots" and "insects", he was actually crippled by a sense of worthlessness and guilt. The "superiority" part falls away completely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">once he pulls his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vegeta of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> has this problem for most of the series. Although he boasts about being the strongest and the prince of his race, he's come across as having an inferiority complex given his constant need to prove himself and his inability to take trash talk. Not helped by Goku always being one step ahead of him, despite all the training he does and Goku being a low-class warrior. His insecurities reached a head in the Buu Saga where Vegeta sold his morality and family for power just so he could finally beat Goku and regain his status of being the best. It isn't until near the end of the series that he finally makes peace with being second best and takes real pride in what he has.
</li><li> Krillin in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">original series</a>. He acts cocky, self-assured, and is a bit of a smartass, but it's all to hide his crippling low self-esteem. He was bullied mercilessly at his former temple for being weak and small, causing him to eventually run away. After becoming friends with Goku and gaining confidence in himself, he drops the superiority act.

<ul><li> This is all but shown explicitly to be behind most of Bakugo's bravado; he feels the need to prove himself superior to everyone so that no one will look down on him. In particular, he wants to prove himself superior to Midoriya (who attempted to save him from a villain at the start of the series and later defeated in him in a training exercise) and All Might (who <em>did</em> save him from the villain). In fact, a bonus chapter had Uraraka point-blank tell Bakugo this is why he is so antagonistic to his former friend. Despite belittling and insulting him, he always shows great fear in Midoriya's massive leaps in improvement because deep down, he knows that Midoriya is much worthier of being a better hero than he is.
</li><li> Also Aoyama, who is always standing out in his way, is shown to "just want to be equal as everyone" later in the manga, being told there that "Your standards must be off if you don't know you are equal as us" in a moment of awesomeness.

Furthermore, he's hampered by the physical limitations of his Hellfire Quirk; he risks overheating if used extensively, which is why he tries to finish fights quickly in single shots lest he burns himself out. This is why he banks on Shoto to become his successor since Shoto's Ice and Fire balance each other and thus are not prone to the weaknesses that hamper him or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that possibly crippled his oldest son and original successor, Touya, whose weaker constitution toward heat made his problem toward his own fire Quirk <em>worse</em> than his father, as implied to be discovered in a training accident</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's pretty clear that Sasuke's need to defeat Itachi was driven almost as much by his need to finally prove himself better than his brother as for revenge. Being born the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a> to a genius older brother and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a> of a distant father were bad enough, but even then, Itachi and Sasuke were quite close, with Sasuke thinking the world of his older brother while Itachi being protective of Sasuke. Then, said brother killed his entire family and told him to hate and grow strong to be worthy to face him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Then</a> Itachi showed up again years later, looking for Naruto, which is what set off Sasuke (both because of this and because well, Itachi was going to target his precious people once more). Sasuke utterly lost and underwent another dose of mental trauma that unstabilized him. It didn't help that Naruto was finally growing strong enough to challenge and maybe surpass Sasuke, the top student of their class. All this was a recipe for a tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Made more ironic when you realize how Itachi <em>played</em> that complex, why he did so, and how it all went wrong.</span> He also shows some behavior of this type towards Naruto himself, though much of this ties into his issues with Itachi. To Sasuke's mind, if Naruto can advance faster than him/become his equal, then he isn't advancing fast enough himself and has no chance of catching up with Itachi. This flaw of his was lampshaded verbatim by Kakashi in an episode.
</li><li> Naruto as well, albeit in a different way. In the beginning, his bratty, braggart attitude, and dreams to be Hokage were driven by a need to be acknowledged by the village and not be viewed as a monster, but as Naruto Uzumaki. His initial rivalry with Sasuke was fueled by his need to prove himself equal to the haughty top student that deep down felt the same sort of pain and loneliness as him (and wanted to befriend him.) Unlike Sasuke though, Naruto would shed his complex as he got people that cared about him and vice versa (which makes for an interesting counterpart to Sasuke, whose process became <em>worse</em> over time, albeit that was Itachi's doing.) In fact, by the time of <em>Shippuden</em>, he's actually prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation">Heroic Self-Deprecation</a>, which increases as he grows stronger (sadly as a result of him reflecting on his failures to save the people he cares about.)
</li><li> Neji seemed to have this to an extent as well. Behind his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a> attitude he belied a huge complex over being a member of the Hyuga's Branch Family, a fate he deeply resented and desperately wanted to escape, even if he would never admit it out loud. Instead, he took out his own insecurities on those he perceived as weaker than him (his teammate Lee and his cousin Hinata) to feel better about himself, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">he would react with anger</a> if somebody exposed those insecurities to him, as it happened in both his fights with Hinata and Naruto. Thankfully he dropped this mindset <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">after Naruto defeated him</a>.
</li><li> Madara Uchiha's complex towards <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the 1st Hokage</span> is probably the most extreme example in the series. In a flashback, even mentioning his name was enough to tick Madara off. In fact, much of the conflict in the current story can ultimately be traced back to Madara's inability to accept being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a> to him and his reaction to this.
</li></ul></li><li> Asuka Langley Soryu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> is practically the poster child for this trope. Outwardly she comes across haughty, arrogant, prideful, and annoying. In reality that is a false persona that she dons to cover up her debilitating lack of self-esteem and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">gut-wrenching fear of being replaced and/or abandoned</a>, a product of childhood trauma.

</li><li> Sae from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeachGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeachGirl">Peach Girl</a> has a high and mighty opinion of herself and literally gets a big head over things working out in her favor. She often spreads gossip around to make people distrust Momo, which is done as a result of her own jealousy and insecurity and to bring herself up.
</li><li> Usopp from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> alternates from bragging about his skills and being cowardly or being deeply insecure about his skills.

</li><li> Iris from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> used to taunt Ash about his battle skills and always calling him a kid. But one episode reveals <em>why</em> she keeps doing it: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she couldn't battle well when her Excadrill starts ignoring her</span>. When this is solved, Iris becomes much friendlier to Ash... though she <em>still</em> calls him a kid from time to time.
<ul><li> In the <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> series, this also applies to Guzma, the leader of Team Skull, who often rants about how he is 'undefeated' when in reality most of his 'non-defeats' were just because he was in one-on-one battles that triggered his Golisopod's Emergency Exit and he claimed that he didn't see the point in continuing the fight.
</li></ul></li><li> A few characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> have distinct shades of this:
<ul><li> Kyouichi Saionji is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> who acts arrogant during duels and with regards to Anthy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">whom he regularly batters</a>) but is also hinted to have issues with self-loathing and has a <em>huge</em> inferiority complex with regards to his childhood frenemy Touga, which drives him to assert himself in horrible ways.
</li><li> Nanami Kiryuu is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> of Ohtori's middle school, but when her beloved big brother (the aforementioned Touga, who just about all her feelings of superiority hinge on) starts screwing her over later in the series, it turns out that she has very little in the way of intrinsic feelings of self-worth. The fact that she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drowned Touga's kitten as a small child</span> doesn't help, fuelling both her extreme clinginess towards her brother (partly out of penance) and her hatred of herself.
</li></ul></li><li> Ayaka Machida from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StellviaOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StellviaOfTheUniverse">Stellvia of the Universe</a></em> has a psychological need to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> and will go to criminal lengths to ensure that. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">entire show</a>, she is pretty much the only character who would willingly hurt another, as she does to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yayoi and Shima (almost), who were both better than her in piloting. When she fails to eliminate Shima and the truth comes out, she is pretty much crushed. Ironically, she is redeemed by Yayoi herself, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">loves her too much</a> to <em>not</em> forgive her</span>. This helps Ayaka to acknowledge that there are pilots better than her and to simply enjoy flying with them (particularly Yayoi) instead of competing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>: Sugou Nobuyuki fancies himself a big and powerful man, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">declaring himself a god</a>, but he's ultimately nothing but a poor imitation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Akihiko Kayaba</a> and he knows it. When the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtualGhost">Virtual Ghost</a> intervenes and grants Kirito <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> powers to turn the tables in his favor, Sugou whines and throws a temper tantrum over the fact that even with Kayaba dead, he's <em>still</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a>. Kirito even lampshades it; while both of them were defeated by Kayaba and forced to work for him, Kirito defied Kayaba while Sugou wants to <em>be</em> him.
</li><li> To different extents, both Kaiba and Dark Yugi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>.
<ul><li> In the former's case, he was an orphan whose only pride was chess and forced the mogul of a big company to adopt him in a chess game. He subsequently takes over the company by force and is obsessed with being number 1. When Dark Yugi beats him in a duel, he becomes obsessed with revenge and coming out on top. In both lives, he seems to have an inferiority complex regarding Yugi, and will only acknowledge him as a rival. While consistently looking down on others, he has a chip on his shoulder in both lifetimes.
</li><li> The latter's case happens in the manga up until Duelist Kingdom — he is confident in his abilities in games to the point of pride and aggression getting the better of him. This seems to be because he doesn't know who he is and assumes that he is merely some other form of Yugi intended to protect him. When he's confronted with the fear of actually having to face loss and not being able to protect Yugi's loved ones, he retreats further into his assumed gaming prowess, underestimating Mai to focus on Pegasus. He grows out of this by admitting his fear, acknowledging the possibility of losing and his pride effectively stops hampering when he learns he was once human, not just a spirit created by the Puzzle.

It bites him in the ass pretty much <em>every single time</em>. His gimmick is that his plans are intersperced with riddles and puzzles that, if solved, allow his schemes to become unraveled. This is obviously counterproductive, but for the Riddler, proving that he's smarter than the authorities (and Batman) is a compulsion so powerful that he literally can't resist it. According to most of his backstories, this is a compulsion he developed in childhood due to being abused into having some <em>major</em> self-esteem issues.
</li><li> This tends to be the case with every <em>Batman</em> villain except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> and Ra's-al-Ghul (who really do think they're as great as they say they are, and often can back it up too). Prominent examples include the Penguin, the Scarecrow, Killer Croc, and even Poison Ivy (despite her talk of the plants, recall she became this after her professor used her and her lifetime of being pushed around by everyone). At their worst, these villains often go so far as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyHunter">murder - or attempt to murder - their real or supposed former tormentors</a>, partly out of spite and partly because, deep down, they feel that the world really must be made safe for people "of their kind."

This is made clearest of all when Po explains the meaning of the Dragon Scroll to him—not only is he unable to accept that the only real power comes from within (because he thinks he has no worth and thus needs outward validation), but when he first stares into the scroll to see only his reflection, he declares, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSymbolism">It's nothing</a>!"

He has a massive inferiority complex due to him being a sickly albino child of his proud parents, despite him being a genius.

By the time he's a young adult, Hans has already given up fighting back as it just makes their physical abuse worse. But by doing this, this only accelerated his father's emotional abuse even more by saying Hans should "learn a thing or two" from his brothers. It's highly implied that his more villainous actions are him emulating his father, desperately hiding his self-hatred.

She's smugly confident in her own abilities and status at Canterlot High when Twilight first runs into her. Throughout the movie, she insists she's the superior pupil, that the crown really belongs to her and she aims to prove it. The switch is flipped when Twilight refuses to hand over the crown under the threat of Sunset destroying the portal back to Equestria and her friends call her a true princess who <em>earned</em> her crown. Sunset, who up to this point managed to keep her cool even in the face of defeat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">proceeds to lunge at Twilight in rage to take the crown by force</a>.

Hermione's fear of failure is so great that her boggart when she was a student was Professor McGonagall telling her she failed all of her classes.
</li><li> Hermione's insecurity being masked by her know-it-all attitude makes her a fascinating comparison to her close friend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and later husband</span>, Ron Weasley, who is pretty open with his insecurity due to being the youngest son (his brothers have already done a lot and his younger sister was the girl his mother always wanted) while being in the shadow of his best friend and thus tends to get a big head whenever he accomplishes something.
</li><li> According to Rowling herself, the person she based Gilderoy Lockhart on may have had this (she's not sure because she "never dug that deep"), so it's possible it could be an explanation for Lockhart's behavior as well. For his part, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KennethBranagh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KennethBranagh">Kenneth Branagh</a> (who played Lockhart) rejects this theory: "I wish I could tell you that it's because he's very insecure. In fact, he's not. He's just a narcissist." Once more of his backstory is revealed, it turns out to be a downplayed example. Lockhart <em>does</em> have a genuinely over-inflated opinion of himself, but he's also aware of his ineptitude and has spent most of his career using the skills he does have to disguise his shortcomings and turn himself into a celebrity. He could actually have been a talented wizard had he put in the effort, but his ego is so big that he refuses to acknowledge this.

And, then there's poor Joy Hill's situation; she gets shunted to the side of almost everything because she's his brother's acknowledged bastard... and acknowledging low-tier by-blows is simply beneath Lannisters — and, despite being kin, you're not a Lannister, Miss <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardAngst">Hill</a></em>.

In the first two books, in particular, it's implied that a lot of her tough and abrasive behavior stems from insecurity after years of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>, in her family (thanks to being the only daughter), on the workforce, where she's the only female detective — even though the very reason she even became a cop was that she felt it was some way that she would finally earn respect, and in life in general because of her plain and average looks, resulting in her striving to excel at everything else in order to compensate.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fatherland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fatherland">Fatherland</a></em>, a nation-wide example of this trope presents itself. Xavier March goes on a bus tour of the "Nazis-won" 1964 Berlin with his son. When pointing out the grandiose landmarks all around them, the tour-guide constantly boasts about how everything is bigger and better than comparable monuments in other cities. Far from being impressed, however, March merely identifies this as a symptom of how deep-down insecure and inferior Nazi Germany as a culture and people actually feels:

He quarrels with Poseidon over who their mother Rhea likes better, is paranoid Poseidon is constantly plotting against him, demands respect when no one respects him, closes off of Olympus due to wounded pride, and tries to blame others for his mistakes. His massive ego and demand people respect and obey him comes across as at least partially trying to cover up his own mistakes and knowledge he is a failure that no one likes, especially when one compares his treatment of others, and how others, in turn, react to him, with his fellow Kings Ra and Odin in their own series having a lot fewer people in those series who snark or debase their kings (at least when Ra isn't senile, then many of the Egyptians Gods will snark at him.)

</li><li> In the Irvine Welsh novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Filth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Filth">Filth</a></em>, Bruce is a boastful, misanthropic bigot who appears to look down on everyone around him.

</li><li> The titular hero of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceRoger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceRoger">Prince Roger</a></em> series embodies this trope at the start. His parents separated before his birth under...tricky circumstances, and his mother was aloof during his childhood because he looks (and behaves) too much like his father. But as Roger knows nothing about this he takes it as a purely personal rejection, and it doesn't help that the whole empire compares him unfavorably to his ridiculously accomplished half-siblings. He grows up into a stroppy, arrogant playboy largely to piss his mother off, but also to cover up how generally <em>lousy</em> he feels about himself. It's no coincidence that he only starts to outgrow his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a> tendencies once others start viewing him as worthy and useful and he gains some actual self-esteem.

<ul><li> Buffy herself: A variation. As noted in a DVD <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">commentary</a>, Buffy has a superiority complex in that she's the Slayer and believes herself better than those she protects (pretty much everyone), but this makes her feel bad so she has an inferiority complex about having the superiority complex. This was also pointed out in-universe by a vampire psychology student who opted to put Buffy on the couch while she was trying to kill him. It actually worked for a while.
</li><li> Wesley. On <em>Buffy</em>, he was pompous and high and mighty when he was more like an inefficient nuisance by everyone else. Then came Angel and after going through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreaktheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreaktheHaughty">a series of horrible situations</a>, it's revealed he never thought he was good enough as a watcher or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyIssues">to his father</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAssWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAssWoobie">Spike</a>. He acts cocky and arrogant to the bone, but all the superior remarks of his are for convincing himself as much as convincing everyone else. This is particularly apparent in his dynamic with Buffy and his centuries-feud with Angel.
</li><li> Faith. She scorns Buffy's moral, 'weight-of-the-world' approach to being a slayer all through Buffy Season 3 and even claimed to her they were better than everyone else, then in S4 undergoes a redemption arc and even begs Angel to kill her in a display of overwhelming self-loathing.
</li><li> Angel is the inverse of this. He has genuine insecurity and self-hatred, all of which he's very open about, but at the same time sometimes acts superior through his actions. It's only with Spike that Angel is a traditional example of this trope: his rivalry with Spike in S5 all but confirmed he felt a certain degree of entitlement in being the vampire with a soul and a champion, the Shanshu prophecy, <em>and</em> having Buffy... until Spike came along. Fueling his insecurities and doubts all the more.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> This comes to dominate the First Doctor's character towards the very end of his run. He starts out as unironically arrogant and in love with his own genius and mellows out a bit. But as more of his assumptions about the way he does things are proven wrong and his favorite companions (Ian and Barbara) make him return them to their own time, his arrogance becomes a cover for his deep-seated uncertainty (not even knowing how to fly his TARDIS, and even if he could, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">he could never go back to his home planet</a>) and loneliness. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in "The Massacre", and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in "The Time Meddler", where his demeanour towards the Monk becomes noticeably more haughty as soon as he realizes that the Monk has a much nicer TARDIS than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">he does</a>.
</li><li> There's a repeated conceit throughout much of the show that the Doctor's lack of belief in formal education and endorsement of instinctual methods of flying the TARDIS is really because he got terrible grades as a student and failed his TARDIS driving exams. See "Terror of the Autons", where the Third Doctor gets snotty when reminded the Master got better grades on his exams than he did, or "The Time of Angels" when the Eleventh Doctor gets very self-righteous when River points out that he doesn't know what a lot of his TARDIS buttons actually do.
</li><li> Few incarnations react with anything other than horror and misery upon seeing their new face for the first time, but soon begin to brag about how handsome it is, suggesting this may be its motive. For example, the Third Doctor sees himself in the mirror at the start of "Spearhead from Space", is mortified, but soon declares it's not all bad and spends the rest of his run acting convinced he's gorgeous. In "The Face of Evil", the Fourth Doctor goes in the space of a single conversation from complaining a statue of him with a doorway behind it isn't very good because 'the nose could be a touch more aquiline', but as soon as Leela suggests the nose might be how they get in (not even directly remarking about its size), the Doctor gives an offended and self-conscious reaction.
</li><li> In the Fourth Doctor book <em>Festival of Death</em>, Romana accuses the Doctor of having this problem at the root of his constant self-aggrandizing academic underachievement and conviction that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolIsForLosers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolIsForLosers">School Is for Losers</a>:
<div class="indent">'Inferiority complex?' The Doctor fixed her with a probing stare. 'What could I possibly have to feel inferior about? Me? K9, have you ever heard anything so ridiculous?' <br/>'Affirmative, master,' replied K9. 'You have frequently made statements with greater nonsensical content.' <br/>'And when I want your opinion I'll ask for it.' The Doctor glared at the robot dog.
</div></li><li> Donna Noble seems to have a bad case of this, likely caused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">her emotionally abusive mother</a>. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoIndoorVoice">loud</a>, sassy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snarky</a>, but quietly rejects any attempt by the Doctor to tell her she's important or special. In "Journey's End", the Metacrisis Doctor finally realizes this is not just humility on her part.
<div class="indent"><strong>Donna:</strong> I keep telling you, I'm <em>not</em> [special]. <br/><strong>Metacrisis Doctor:</strong> No, but you are-! <em>(he pauses)</em> Oh... You really don't believe that, do you? I can see, Donna. What you're thinking. All that attitude, all that lip, 'cause all this time... You think you're not worth it. <br/><strong>Donna:</strong> <em>(half-heartedly)</em> Stop it. <br/><strong>Metacrisis Doctor:</strong> Shouting at the world 'cause no-one's listening. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Well</a>, why should they? <br/><strong>Donna:</strong> <em>(quietly)</em> Doctor. Stop it.
</div></li><li> The Tenth Doctor himself had a bad case of this. Both during Nine and Eleven's runs, and quite a few scenes during Ten's run, have shown the massive guilt and self-loathing he feels about the destruction of the Time Lords, not all of it unwarranted, which seems at odds with his general demeanor of being cocky and almost arrogant, a trait that was exaggerated more and more later in his run, culminating in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">Time Lord Victorious</a> speech in "The Waters of Mars". This seems like the best explanation.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> behavior near the start of the series is quickly put down to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> of having a very demanding and emotionally-distant father, and it's clear in his insecurity with Guinevere, Merlin, Morgana, and Lancelot that he doesn't consider himself worthy of their affection or friendship, even as he takes them all for granted.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>'s Kerry Weaver frequently found subtle and not-so-subtle ways of putting her coworkers down, turning everything into some kind of competition, and eventually trampled on numerous people in order to advance her career, all to compensate for whatever insecurity she felt about having been abandoned at birth and being disabled. Additionally, it's heavily implied that Doug's womanizing behavior was a form of compensation for feeling unlovable (due to his father abandoning him).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, Arnold Rimmer is always publicly aggrandising himself: of <em>course</em> he'd pass the officer's exam if Lister hadn't stopped him studying, of <em>course</em> he'd be a great military leader if he had that opportunity<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1mmtt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1mmtt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1mmtt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In "Legion" he claims to be a brave warrior soul who, through no fault of his own, was born in the body of an abject coward</span>, and so on. However, in "Terrorform", the most powerful force in his mind is self-loathing, and in "Inquisitor" he admits he's nothing "but from where I started, nothing is up". Essentially he tries desperately to believe he's the sort of son his parents wanted but knows he isn't and doesn't know how to be anything else.

Consequently, he's clearly also full of bitterness, self-loathing, and insecurity.
</li><li> Kendall Roy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Succession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Succession">Succession</a></em> practically oozes insecurity, desperation, and self-loathing despite playing at being a confident, ruthless businessman.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> is full of these. To the extent that it could be considered one of the main themes of the game:
<ul><li> Cloud insists on showing off as much as possible, striking poses and being flamboyantly snarky towards others. This is later revealed to be a false persona that stemmed from a complex caused by his feelings of worthlessness, exacerbated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">Jenova cells</a> and trauma. At one point, he states that as a child he dealt with his isolation and feelings of worthlessness by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntelligenceEqualsIsolation">convincing himself that it was because everyone other than him was stupid</a>.
</li><li> A similar case can be made for Cloud's enemy, Sephiroth. When he learned he was the product of sick science and some sort of alien monster "lady", he... didn't take it well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">To say the least</a>.

Upon realising he isn't a real human, Cloud <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">quotes him</a> as saying that he'd always known he was strange and different when compared to other people, "but... not like this...". A week later, he's declaring himself the 'rightful heir to this Planet' and planning to become a God. His arrogance even allows him to re-emerge five years after his apparent death falling into a reservoir of Mako energy, without having experienced the ego-death that is suffered by most people heavily exposed to Mako energy.
</li><li> Red XIII acts haughty, intelligent and ancient, with little time for the inexplicable behaviour of humans. To Red's embarrassment and Cloud's surprise, it later turns out that he's the equivalent of a fifteen-year-old boy and he still lives with his grandfather, and he was showing off due to feelings of inadequacy.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> has it that she was mostly isolated growing up due to her surveillance by the Turks and because her abilities led people to consider her creepy. By the end of the first Disc, she has so much control over her powers that she can translate the words of spirits, interfere with Cloud's dreams to speak to him while he's unconscious, find the lost City of the Ancients and cast her mother's spell.

However, most fans do think Yuffie's speech was about her real reasoning, even if she was using it to manipulate the others. Many of her in-party scenes show her tough-girl attitude falling apart when faced with genuinely threatening and disturbing things, like confronting the shooter in the Battle Square, saying goodbye to Aerith, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest">working up the courage to kiss a boy</a>.

But then ANOTHER Genome was created with a soul (on purpose this time) and was scheduled to be Kuja's replacement. Kuja reacted... badly. He kidnapped the child and dropped him into the world Kuja was to help destroy, all out of a desire to prove himself superior.

The only way he could achieve any level of success was by aligning himself with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> and accepting that he would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">Always Second Best</a>, which was a massive blow to his ego. When Michaels was forced to retire, Triple H set out to prove he was the best wrestler in the world (specifically better than Shawn) and win the audience's adoration, but no matter how hard he tried there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a> standing in his way, making him turn to any means necessary to win. When he finally did manage to claw his way to the top, there was always somebody else younger, tougher or more popular coming up from behind that he had to cut down to protect his self-esteem.

He's rude to his uncle, berates his crew, and frequently loses his temper over small things.

Zuko is actually a sensitive and compassionate kid, but who sees himself as inferior due to these perceived "weaknesses", especially next to his prodigious, ruthless sister Azula. Furthermore, his compassion and sensitivity were what got him in trouble in the first place (after speaking against a general for planning to use new recruits as cannon fodder.

After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">joining the Avatar's group</a>, he comes to realise these are his strengths, not his weaknesses.

It's less clear than with Azula what Ozai felt about this relationship, but it's not difficult to see the similarities in their cases, their personalities, and their temperaments. He is so bitter about not receiving as much respect as his brother that he demands perfection from his own children and punishes perceived weakness or insubordination in his eldest son with extraordinary brutality; when he promotes himself from Fire Lord to Phoenix King and plans to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> exterminate the Earth Kingdom</span> he essentially acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> revelling in childish fantasies of power and greatness, but he was so obsessed with the two mostly because of his insecurities.

However, while ponies frolicked during the day, they either slept through or outright feared the night, and by association seemed to love Celestia and—at best—be ambivalent towards Luna.

</li><li> It's heavily implied, if not outright stated, that the reason Mr. Cat constantly brags about his intelligence, strength, and other talents is because he has no self-esteem, so he inflates his ego to make himself feel better.

Tina accurately guessed that he's an "insecure little weirdo who lies about everything and probably cries himself to sleep".

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Fictional media often portrays bullies as having low self-esteem, with their big egos being a facade to cover up their insecurities. While this is sometimes true, studies show that most real-life bullies actually have <em>high</em> self-esteem and genuinely do believe they are better than their targets, making them more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> than this trope. Still, people who admit to having been bullies as kids have <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fyiliving.com/health-news/bullies-grow-up-to-become-disturbed-adults/">poorer mental health on average.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Additionally, bullies who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolyardBullyAllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolyardBullyAllGrownUp">fail to shed their abusive behaviour</a> are significantly more likely to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">sadists</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopaths</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">psychopaths</a>, placing them as being equally more likely to engage in criminal acts or acts of violence in the future.
</li><li> In contrast, the victims of bullies can exhibit this trope played straight, as a result of sustained psychological and physical trauma; one coping strategy victims may employ is inflating their ego in an attempt to look as if they haven't suffered as much as they really have, only for this noble attempt at deflection to be destroyed the moment their abusers return to harm them again. This, tragically, is how some victims of bullying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">become bullies themselves</a>.
</li><li> At least one form of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder">Narcissistic personality disorder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is believed to result from a subconscious lack of self-worth, whereas others are just pure self-centredness or flat-out delusions of grandeur. That said, it's not always clear if the chronic insecurity is actually the cause of their gigantic ego, or merely a symptom, with the truth probably varying from one person to the next.
</li><li> In his essay, <a class="urllink" href="http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html">"Why Nerds Are Unpopular,"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> technologist Paul Graham made the following observation:
<div class="indent">Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks."
</div></li><li> This appears to have been a problem for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a>. His arrogant attitude covered up the fact that he hated his own singing, and in one interview he went on record as saying there wasn't a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Beatles</a> song he wouldn't re-record.
</li><li> To some extent, people with body dysmorphic disorder. It is a mental condition where the person is excessively concerned with their body image, feeling they are always too fat, skinny, or just unattractive, and obsessed with fixing this. This, in turn, can lead to anorexia, excessive exercising, or repeated plastic surgery. So if you think all bodybuilders are full of themselves when flexing in front of a mirror, think again.
</li><li> Adlerian "individual psychology" is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>. Alfred Adler's idea of psychological health was the ability to actualize an ideal self. A superiority complex is what happens when perceived failures to live up to this ideal results in an unhealthy overcompensation as a coping mechanism. A healthier approach (according to Adler) is either a more appropriate self-ideal or working to improve the weak spots.
