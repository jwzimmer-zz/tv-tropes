However, they all fail. But nothing lasts forever...
</p><p>Basically, this is a character who is introduced as and/or is famous for being brutally unstoppable, and, for a long time, they continue to be so, until that one hero (or villain) can finally show the world what he's made of by defeating him. These characters appear in varied roles: they can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, or, sometimes, just some seemingly unobtainable goal. Often, such a character will also be either a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> or somewhat intimidating to give the hero even more support for beating him, but not always. This character may also play a role of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath">Goliath</a></em> if the one who beats him looks to be totally outmatched at first glance.

</p><p>Depending on the character, the fighter can still stay as powerful as they were after being beaten, but, occasionally, once beaten, they lose their power and become a regular fighter just like the rest.

<ul><li> The East is burning red! Master Asia's first appearance on screen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> involves destroying 3 giant robots with his bare hands by catching and returning artillery shells, picking up the ground one was standing on, and tearing one to pieces with a headband. He is in fact explicitly titled "The Undefeated of the East"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> fans theorize that this is the reason Captain Whitebeard was rarely characterized as anything but "the World's Strongest Man". Obviously someone's going to rise to his level and beat him in battle, most likely the main character or a future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It actually took an entire army, including all three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">Admirals</a> and five of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, a regretted ambush from one of Whitebeard's allies, and Blackbeard's entire crew to kill him.</span>
<ul><li> Shown example includes when Luffy defeats Eneru, due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Rubber Man</a> which Eneru's lightning powers couldn't directly harm. Up until then, the Skypeians, some of the Shandians, and possibly even Nami believed, from seeing what he could do, he was as he said—literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">an invincible god.</a>
</li><li> Another example is when the Straw Hat Pirates raided Enies Lobby and defeated CP9, who have never failed a mission, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">exist only in rumor</a>, and as far as Marines were concerned, were the reason Enies Lobby had never fallen to anyone. In fact, this generation of CP9 were the strongest in its history. More specifically, Monkey D. Luffy defeating Rob Lucci, the strongest <em>individual</em> in CP9's history, who had such a reputation that the Marines leading the Buster Call were more than willing to bet that he would win for sure. Only for him to be put in a coma by Luffy. Even Bartholomew Kuma did not see coming that Lucci would be defeated <em>at all</em>, let alone by Luffy.
</li><li> Crocodile definitely counts. He's introduced to us as the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the Grand Line, belonging to the same group as Mihawk (who had curbstomped Zoro a while earlier). Luffy challenges him... and almost gets killed for it. Crocodile proceedes with his plan, but Luffy turns up again, now knowing Crocodile's weakness... and he almost gets killed again. In the end the rubber man manages to defeat the sand man - who had fought with a poisoned hook. If it weren't for his extreme luck, Luffy would've been deader than dead.
</li><li> Which makes the one guy of this type that remains all the more awesome: Mihawk. He is always referred to as "the World's Greatest Swordsman", has never been defeated and used to spar with Shanks until Shanks lost his left arm, after which he didn't see enough of a challenge in him. Just a reminder, Shanks is one of the four guys the entire Marines are supposed to counteract.
</li><li> Beating one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea or Four Emperors in general is this trope. The Warlords rely on their reputation just to help cull the pirate population, while the Emperors have been stated to be the four most powerful pirates in the world. Defeating any one of them could throw the balance of the Three Great Powers off-kilter.
</li><li> If you tangle with the Four Emperors and get any sort of victory at all, it's already a massive credit to your strength. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Defeating the single most powerful subordinate one of the Emperors has, one so idolized not even his colleagues and brothers thought he could ever be defeated and thought of him as pretty much perfection incarnate, definitely qualifies as this. And yet Luffy tangled with Big Mom, and took down Katakuri, a billion-plus-Belli-bounty nightmare, and <em>none</em> of the Big Mom pirates could believe it, not even the ones that directly witnessed it. Ironically, the only person who even accepted the fact he could be and did get defeated was Katakuri himself, who found Luffy to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> he never realized he needed</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Kazu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear">Air Gear</a></em> was already getting some serious badass cred from his fight with Sleipnir, but he finally proves, once and for all, that he's no longer the little bitch who needs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Ikki</a> to fight for him when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">takes out Nike, a ridiculously powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Hero Killer</a> who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">never lost a fight</a></span>. Sure, he had help, but he still stood alone for most of the battle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em>, we have WBA Featherweight Champion Ricardo Martinez, the "living legend", who is just <em>made</em> of this trope. Point. by. point. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eiji Date, the former Japanese champion, local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a> and the only Japanese boxer to defeat Ippo in an official fight was defeated <em>twice</em> by him.</span>
<ul><li> Takamura, one of the <em>protagonists</em>, is this trope to all of his opponents. He <em>has</em> the reputation of being unbeatable and his opponents do fear and respect his strength. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> outright says he is the best boxer in the entire series, above even the aforementioned Ricardo.
</li></ul></li><li> Three villains in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> (King Piccolo, Frieza, and Buu) were known to be nearly unstoppable and had been terrorizing the world/galaxy/universe for ages; eventually all three of these were defeated by Goku.
<ul><li> Frieza in particular was referred to by every character who knew him as the undisputed strongest being in the universe, such that he has (at least by his claim) never had to use anything close to his maximum power to defeat an opponent before he faces the Z-fighters, and even the arrogant Vegeta didn't want to fight him without the power of <em>immortality</em> on his side.
</li><li> Broly's unique form of Super Saiyan is apparently <em>the</em> Super Saiyan of legend, which renders Vegeta (usually beyond stubborn) near-catatonic in his presence. It takes Goku and Vegeta fusing into Gogeta to defeat him.
</li><li> Cell is a unique case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">a villain who goes from being a simple minded man-eating monster to the closest thing to a god at that point at the time</a> and he was also stronger than Goku at the time. In fact he is this until Gohan kills him.
</li><li> The role is reversed with Beerus, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the 14th movie and the universe's designated God of Destruction. Not even Goku can defeat him, even after he briefly becomes a Super Saiyan God. To top it off, not only is his attendant Whis actually his trainer, but he reveals that the other universes have warriors stronger than him or Goku.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Gaara had never been injured before his fight with Lee, and Naruto defeated him for the first time. Pain also never lost a battle, even against the leader of the Rain Village, one of the strongest ninja in the world who defeated the three Sannin, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he loses to Naruto.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DotHack">.hack</a></em> franchise, just about anything created by Morganna might count: the Dawn Wanderers (aka "Guardians") went undefeated throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign">.hack//SIGN</a></em>, except at the end, where <em>one</em> was taken down by a large team of players (that included one of the most powerful players in the game, bar none). The eight Phases (Skeith in particular) also wreaked havoc throughout The World, being completely unstoppable by way of having infinite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>.
<ul><li> The backstory also provides another example in The One Sin, a boss monster of the original World so powerful no player could beat it. Doing so is what earned Balmung of the Azure Sky and Orca of the Azure Sea their status as legendary players.
<ul><li> Aaaaaaand then G.U. brings it back as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, alongside giving it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form, the God Eater, and a third incarnation known as The One Death.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>, Accelerator. The most powerful esper in Academy City, no one has ever managed to land so much as a single blow on him. Then Touma Kamijou comes along, manages to negate Accelerator's power, and defeats him in combat by punching his lights out. Touma has a tendency to do this to other people as well, all thanks to his power to nullify anything.
<ul><li> Shizuri Mugino was ranked the fourth most powerful esper in Academy City, then Shiage Hamazura, a guy with no powers at all, tricks her into blowing herself up. All thanks to his ingenuity and determination, he beats her in both rematches as well.

(Of course, while V's card, Number 9: Dyson Sphere, was a <em>very</em> powerful card that sure <em>seemed</em> undefeatable, V's claim that it was never defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">had an obvious flaw:</a> he clearly could not have used it more than once or twice in the past, seeing as a duel using a Duel Monster the size of the sun would likely have been witnessed. So his boast that it had "never been defeated" was probably meaningless. Unless one considers the possibility of V using this card in Duels not involving realistic holograms, but seeing how the series treats Duels, Especially ones involving Numbers, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>, it's improbable.)
<ul><li> <em>Definitely</em> meaningless. In a later duel, Kaito used Number 9 against Tron, and Tron defeated it with a Monster that was not even his strongest card. Clearly, there are far stronger Numbers than Number 9, and V's claim was complete BS.
</li><li> Or... Tron was the person who taught V how to fight, considering this was his father who was also a more experienced duelist than he was.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saki">Saki</a></em> has Shiraitodai Girls School, the two time champion in high school team mahjong. Its ace player, Teru Miyanaga, is touted as the best individual mahjong player in the high school circuit, and is the sister of the title character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> has Kuromorimine Women's College, which have won the high school sensha-do (tankery) championship for 9 years. Their loss in the year before the storyline was not because of a better team, but because the commander of their flag tank abandoned her position to save a friendly tank that had fallen into a river.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em> has the Sannoh Industry Affiliated High School basketball team. They have been the defending national champions for three years running and are ranked as an AA team. To give an idea of how powerful they are, the year prior to the start of the story they defeated Kainan, who are Kanagawa's top team for 16 years straight, by <em>30</em> points of difference, and since their current senior players joined, they haven't lost a single game. Shohoku faces them in the second round of the nationals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">barely winning by <em>one</em> point in the last second.</span>

Not that Thing beat him physically; Thing was just too stubborn to stay down after getting knocked out, so the Champion conceded. More recently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a> beat him too.
<ul><li> Champion of the Universe is considered by many fans to be a subversion (or very bad example) of this as he has pretty much never defeated <em>anyone</em> with a name.
<ul><li> He has defeated Adam Warlock, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BetaRayBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BetaRayBill">Beta Ray Bill</a>, Drax the Destroyer, the Silver Surfer and <em>Gladiator</em>. He handily beat She-Hulk as well; however, she then spent a month working her ass off (in human form) and bulked up impressively...and realized the Infinity Gem he was using could be counted as a "weapon" - and was therefore against the rules - and beat the tar out of him. With the Gem, he is <em>undefeatable</em>. Without it, he's tough, but not impossibly so. Gladiator is quick to note that any of them could have beaten him at that point, to which She-Hulk responds by... saying something outrageously sexist.
</li><li> He is apparently defeated for good when Titania, armed with the Gem, picked up a mountain and squashed him under it. He's immortal, but without the Gem, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">he's not strong enough to free himself</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Not at all an unheard story in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">MMA</a>, although all-around badass Fedor Emelianenko has had the most success at remaining undefeated, with a record of 31-1-1, the loss coming from a controversial stoppage due to a cut on his head and the no-contest from an accidental headbutt.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, the other side is that in a rematch the former "undefeatable" may show that the loss or draw was actually a fluke, leading to an unfortunate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>. Cases in point: Matt Serra against Georges St-Pierre, Tsuyoshi Kousaka against Fedor (the cut loss), and Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira (the accidental headbutt no contest).
</li><li> Pretty much Mauricio "Shogun" Rua's claim to fame in the modern UFC: after two poor first performances in the company, he showed renewed form in knocking down Chuck Liddell and slugging him out in the first round, then gave the <em>performance of a lifetime</em> against legend-in-the-making UFC light heavyweight champion Lyoto Machida, only to lose the highly controversial decision that almost everyone except the judges thought was Shogun's. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He then goes on to knock out Machida in the first round in their rematch, winning the Light-Heavyweight title.</span>
</li><li> Frankie "The Answer" Edgar took the UFC lightweight belt from the previously considered "unbeatable" B.J. Penn at UFC 112. Penn hadn't lost in the lightweight division in <em>eight years</em>, but Edgar managed to upset the champ with a set gameplan; mixing up his offense, and pushing the pace with his speed.
</li><li> It eventually happened to aforementioned Fedor Emelianenko after he received his first legitimate loss to Fabricio Werdum. Werdum was understandably excited.
<ul><li> It happened again the fight after that, with Antonio "bigfoot" Silva dominating him and beating him by TKO.
</li></ul></li><li> Most recently, Chris Weidman knocking out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Anderson Silva</a>, who had a 17 fight winning streak, with his last loss being a DQ.
</li><li> It happened again in May of 2014: UFC Bantamweight Champion Renan Barao had not lost a professional fight since his very first one in 2005 and had been either Interim or Undisputed Bantamweight Champion since July of 2012. Then came unheralded underdog TJ Dillashaw, who proceeded to not only defeat Barao but thoroughly dominate him through the first four rounds before <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TKOing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TKOing">TK Oing</a> him in the fifth to take the title.
</li><li> UFC 193 on November 14, 2015 saw what most fans and experts considered the impossible: The defeat of "Rowdy" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RondaRousey">Ronda Rousey</a>. 20-1 underdog and former pro boxer Holly Holm would shock the world by dominating Rousey en route to a shocking second round KO, becoming only the second person to win the UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship and handing Rousey her first MMA loss.
</li><li> UFC 194 just under a month later possibly topped Rousey's loss with the long-awaited Featherweight title unification bout between Jose Aldo and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConorMcGregor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConorMcGregor">Conor McGregor</a>. The fight had five months of hype behind it, it had an added stipulation that the winner would join Ronda Rousey on the box for the next game, and both men had long, ostentatious entrances. The fight? It lasted <em>thirteen seconds</em>, with McGregor knocking Aldo out with the first punch of the fight.
</li><li> Unfortunately for McGregor, it happened to him as well: at UFC 196, he moved up to welterweight for a short-notice, non-title fight against Nate Diaz. McGregor did well enough in the first round but suddenly tired in the second, allowing major underdog Diaz to force him to tap out to a rear naked choke, handing McGregor his first loss in some time and first in the UFC. Earlier, the aforementioned Holly Holm suffered her first pro loss at the hands of another massive underdog: two-time Rousey victim Miesha Tate, who choked Holm out to win the Women's Bantamweight title.
</li><li> Luke Rockhold had not lost in the UFC since his debut against a PED-aided Vitor Belfort. Since then, he had gone on a tear, finishing opponent after opponent, including taking the Middleweight belt from the aforementioned Chris Weidman in 2015, prompting many to proclaim him the true successor to Anderson Silva atop the divisional throne.. His first title defense was against short notice replacement Michael "The Count" Bisping, who had been submitted by Rockhold almost two years earlier. The heavy underdog Bisping would exact his revenge by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KOing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KOing">K Oing</a> Rockhold to win the title in the first round.

Few gave her UFC 217 opponent, Rose Namajunas, a chance of pulling off the upset despite Namajunas' skills growing by leaps and bounds during her time in the UFC. But pull it off she did, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TKOing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TKOing">TK Oing</a> Jedrzejczyk in the very first round to capture the championship.

But when the two rematched at UFC 227, "Mighty Mouse" was finally toppled from his throne via a hard-fought split decision. The man who did so? <em>Henry Cejudo.</em>

At UFC 232, she defended her championship against UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion (and the woman who retired Ronda Rousey) Amanda Nunes, but despite being the overwhelming favorite, she fell to Nunes via knockout in a staggering <em>fifty-one seconds.</em>

<ul><li> Tiger Woods was 14-0 in golf's four major championships when he held the lead (by himself or with others) after 54 of 72 regulation holes...but that came to a stunning end when he lost the 2009 PGA Championship with a two stroke 54 hole lead to unheralded Y.E. Yang. And then three months later Tiger crashed into a fire hydrant outside his home in Florida, and the rest has been history.
</li><li> Mike Tyson was the undisputed heavyweight boxing champion who was mowing down everyone who came into his path, including previously unbeaten champions like Michael Spinks...in 91 seconds. James "Buster" Douglas was supposed to be just another speed bump to the champ (in fact, the February 1990 fight was held in Tokyo because no American venue would have it). No one told Douglas, though, who proceeded to knock out Tyson in the 10th round and become one of the unlikeliest heavyweight champions in boxing history.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_Ice">Miracle on Ice<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where the USA ice hockey team of the 1980 Winter Olympics manage to defeat a Soviet team that was nigh-unbeatable in the world scene for more than a decade. For bonus points, the USA team was made up of collegiate ice hockey players and had been crushed by the Soviets in an earlier exhibition game 10 to 3. "Do you believe in miracles?"
</li><li> The "Miracle of Berne" (4 July, 1954) in which the West German team came back from trailing 0-2 against the "Magical Magyars" to win <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">the FIFA World Cup</a> by 3 goals to 2. This ended an undefeated run by the Hungarian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football (soccer)</a> team lasting four years and 32 matches, during which they won the Olympic gold medal in 1952, the 1953 European Cup of National Teams (precursor of the UEFA European Championship), became the first continental European team to defeat England in Wembley Stadium (by 6-3) and defeated West Germany by 8-3 in the opening round of the 1954 World Cup.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Tennis</a> star Rafael Nadal entered the 2009 French Open as the World No. 1 and 4-time defending champion who had never been beaten on French clay ever since his debut at the 2005 French Open, not even by the legendary Roger Federer, and had just set a record streak of 31 wins at the French Open. His fourth-round opponent, Robin Soderling, was all set up to become yet another one of his conquests as the 23rd seed who had never even reached the quarterfinals of a major tournament before and had been steamrolled by Nadal in all of their previous matches. Soderling apparently hadn't read the script, however, as he proceeded to turn in the game of his life and defeat Nadal in one of the biggest upsets in tennis history.
<ul><li> And it happened to Nadal <em>again</em> at Wimbledon 2014. Back at number 1 in the world and the current French Open and US Open Champion and runner-up at the Australian Open, he played Nick Kyrgios, a 19 year old Australian ranked 145th in the world, in the fourth round. Nadal was defeated in four sets.
</li></ul></li><li> A literal example in the 2007-08 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> XLII match between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants. The Patriots had an undefeated regular and playoff season. They seem to have the best offense and defense ever assembled in NFL history, or so the many sports commentators kept saying. Superstar quarterback Tom Brady completed 50 touchdowns throughout the season, running up the score and completely dominating most defenses he faced. The whole country believed they'd be the second team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to have a a perfect NFL season, complete with a Super Bowl victory. At the same time, the New York Giants had an up and down season, even being narrowly defeated by the Patriots in the last game of the season. There were times when the fans demanded that the managers fire coach Tom Coughlin and replace quarterback Eli Manning, whom many football fans regarded as not being as talented as his older brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton Manning</a>. However they fought and clawed their way to the playoffs and the Super Bowl game. During the game, millions who watched were in shock as not only did the Giants stop the Patriots dominating offense, but they were able to only hold them to 14 points, winning the game. Eli finally escaped from his brother's shadow by matching him with a Super Bowl win and MVP title, and Tom Coughlin had his coaching contract extended. And just to show the win wasn't a fluke, they beat the Patriots again in Super Bowl XLVI at the end of the 2011-12 season, and Eli Manning surpassed his brother with two Super Bowl wins and MVP titles (until Peyton won his second ring at Super Bowl 50 at the end of the 2015-16 season).
</li><li> When chess grandmaster Jose Capablanca was defeated by fellow grandmaster Richard Reti in the 1924 grandmaster tournament in New York, it was his first loss under tournament conditions in <em>eight years</em>.
<ul><li> Capablanca's loss in the World Championship match to Alexander Alekhine was also an example, as he was considered so dominant that no one expected him to lose.
</li><li> Vladimir Kramnik defeating Garry Kasparov in the year 2000 was a similar situation.
</li><li> Correspondence Grandmaster Arno Nickel managed to win a match against Hydra, the strongest chess computer of the time (this was a computer significantly more advanced and powerful than Deep Blue).
</li></ul></li><li> In a way, the Miami Heat vs the San Antonio Spurs in 2013. Up until that point, the Spurs never lost in the NBA Finals; they never even <em>trailed</em> in a Finals series. They were up 1-0, 2-1, 3-2, and were literally 28 seconds away from winning their fifth championship... and then the Heat improbably forced overtime in Game 6, took that game by the slimmest of margins, and proceeded to defeat the Spurs in Game 7, becoming the only team to have beaten the Spurs in the Finals. This is especially poignant since the Spurs proceeded to defeat the Heat in the Finals in 2014.
</li><li> Rulon Gardner winning the gold medal in Greco-Roman wrestling in overtime, against Aleksandr Karelin at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Until that victory, Karelin had been undefeated for <em>13 years</em> (out of a 18 year-long career), the last 6 years during which he <strong>didn't give up a single point to his opponents</strong>.
</li><li> Happened again with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeBronJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeBronJames">LeBron James</a>, who was the star of the 2013 Miami Heat team, when he went back to the Cleveland Cavaliers and reached the finals in the 2015-16 season. This time he took on the Golden State Warriors in the finals after losing to them the previous year during the 2014-15 season. The Warriors seemed like the new superstar team in the West Coast, after the Spurs and the Lakers, to win multiple back to back titles and become a dynasty. The team's roster was stacked with great starter and bench players, with a superstar point guard in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StephenCurry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StephenCurry">Stephen Curry</a>, whose ball handling and shooting skills seemed inhuman. Everything seemed to good as planned with the Warriors taking a dominating 2-0 lead. Everyone was predicting a NBA finals sweep, until LeBron James and his point guard Kyrie Irving played some of the greatest basketball in NBA history, especially Irving who, while good, wasn't seen at the time as an elite player. They would be the first team in NBA history to turn around a 1-3 disadvantage during the finals, finally winning the title LeBron promised the city of Cleveland since he turned pro as a teenager.
</li><li> Serena Williams went into the 2015 US Open having won the last four tennis majors and being the overwhelming favorite to complete a calendar-year Grand Slam (i.e. winning all four tennis majors in a single year). Everything seemed to align for her in the semifinals with her opponent being 43th-ranked Roberta Vinci who had a 0-4 record against her and Flavia Pennetta taking out 2nd-seeded Simona Halep in the other semifinal...then Vinci <em>won</em> in one of the biggest sports upsets of all time.
