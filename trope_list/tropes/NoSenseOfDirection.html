<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> is Ryōga Hibiki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>.
<ul><li> He's <em>so</em> predictably late that everyone schedules their meetings with him a week early to allow for a week of him finding his way. A big part of his backstory is that he missed a fight with Ranma because he got lost for three days, despite the place they were supposed to meet was <em>behind Ryōga's house</em>. He's not only terrible at finding directions inside a single house, but also at knowing where to run towards in a race right at the starting point.
</li><li> This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">runs in his family</a> and leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> as they can never manage to find their way home at the same time (girl-Ranma was even able to claim she was a sister he had never met using this and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent">Wig, Dress, Accent</a>). Even one of his puppies suffers from this condition, although the dog mother doesn't seem to be affected for some reason.
</li><li> He seems to always either take the wrong direction (when given the choice between three roads, one of which he's told is right and one of which he's told is wrong, he takes the third road), or take directions too literally (when told to go "straight down the road" to the Seikan Tunnel from Hokkaido, he did just that — despite the fact the road curved and his route caused him to leap off of the road). His absurd levels of stamina, which lets him run at top speed for literally hours or even days without stopping, as well as being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">plough right through everything in his path</a>, makes this worse as he can cover distances far sooner than direction-givers might expect and, particularly after learning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Breaking Point</a>, there's literally nothing that can force him to change directions.
</li><li> In the Shishi Hokodan story arc, Ranma is reading a letter from Ryōga which he claims to have sent from Hokkaido. It's accompanied by a photo of him standing in front of a sign reading "Welcome to Hong Kong" with Chinese locals visible in the background, so there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a> evidence of Ryōga traversing an ocean without realizing it. (Except that the signs were mistranslated, and written in Hiragana, it read "Nagasaki Kunchi", which is, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, "the most famous festival in Nagasaki, Japan").
</li><li> In his first appearance, there's a snippet with people laughing when he says he walked to that location. He's on a <em>yacht</em>.
</li><li> At one point, he goes the wrong direction <em>immediately after being given directions</em>.
</li><li> He once made a map describing how he found the item of the week. The map shows France, Africa, China, the dojo, and a red car.
</li><li> He even went the wrong direction from the starting line in a race. It was a <em>three-legged</em> race and he was tied to Ukyo who was going the right way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They still won by reaching the goal from the other side.</span>
</li><li> One of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSong">Image Songs</a> (<em>Haikei Akane-san</em>) is written as a travel card/love letter to Akane. He angsts a lot about being so far away from her, but the lyrics make it clear that while he thinks he's in the other end of Japan, he's probably in her backyard.
</li><li> Fanfiction likes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">emphasize</a> this. Numerous fanfics have him getting so badly lost he somehow manages to wander into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">other dimensions</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AniMayhem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/AniMayhem">Ani-Mayhem</a></em> represented this particular quirk by forcing Ryōga to move in a random direction <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">every third turn</a>; on top of that, in an odd example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">Painting the Medium</a>, Ryōga's card uses a different icon for his Movement stat than every other character in the game<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1779t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1779t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1779t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Normally it's six arrows radiating out from a central point; for him, it's an arrow looping back on itself, which caused confused fans to ask if that meant he had to move in a circle</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Several of the Straw Hat pirates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, as pictured.
<ul><li> Roronoa Zoro (pictured above, upper left), by far the worst, is prone to get lost easily. Hilariously seen in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCm-ypxAXdg">a fan video.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> To the tune of Yakety Sax, for added points. While Ryōga Hibiki may have the worst sense of direction in anime/manga, Zoro is an easy close second.
<ul><li> He'll take off in the opposite direction as soon as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam">The Team</a> sets out.
</li><li> When needing to go south, he once went in exactly the wrong direction despite being in the company of a bird whose head will only ever point to the south.
</li><li> When told to head north, he climbs the tallest building in the vicinity (again, the "north is up" principle).
</li><li> He can be quoted as having once said "It was on the right side of the map, so I just have to keep going right." He then turned to the left.
</li><li> Zoro gets lost in a situation where it should've been <em>impossible</em>, and often blames the others for "getting lost". The absolute worst example has to be at Enies Lobby. After Nami outright tells him to <em>follow her</em>, he gets lost walking to a set of stairs <em>20 feet in front of him.</em> He blames Nami's bad directions. Chopper (pictured above, upper right) responded by offering to make Zoro <em>a cure for hopeless idiocy</em>.
</li><li> Post-time skip, when the crew was reuniting on Sabaody Archipelago, Zoro was <em>first</em> one there and is incredibly smug about it (though it was thanks to Perona's help). Though played straight back into position when he decides to go fishing and gets on a pirate ship as well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He blames destiny and cuts the ship in half.</span>
</li><li> He has, on the other hand, no trouble finding someone when <em>he wants to get away from them</em>, like in a post-Enies Lobby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episode when he's wearing an embarrassing shirt he doesn't want to be seen in, and ends up running into <em>everyone in the crew</em> when trying to avoid them.
</li><li> He's been called a <em>fantasista</em> (roughly, calling someone a "daydreamer" in a derogatory fashion) twice. By Nami in Enies Lobby, and by Perona in the Whereabouts stories.
</li><li> Anime managed to take it up to eleven: in the G8 filler arc, the marines have set up an ambush at one end of a straight hallway and it doesn't have any offshoots from it. Zoro was leading the crew down that hallway towards the end where the marines set up the ambush, but they were being followed by a separate bunch of marines. Somehow the marines that were chasing Zoro and the crew got to the ambush before the Straw Hats did. It is this event that proves Zoro can get lost in a straight hallway.
</li><li> Manga now decided to say hold my beer: he manages to get lost and separated from his group of Luffy, Law, and Kiku <em>while they're all riding on the back of the same lion-dog</em>, without any battle involved. In short, he managed to get lost <strong>while just sitting down</strong>.
</li><li> Subverted in one instance. Yes, Zoro <em>did</em> get lost, but on this occasion it was not the fault of his poor sense of direction. The miniature islands of the Shabaody Archipelago have numbers on giant trees to act as a guide. Zoro recognized this and assumed he wouldn't get lost so long as he remembered to look for tree number 1. The number was actually <em>4</em>1, but his view of it was obscured.
</li><li> During one of the anime filler episodes that added onto the Long Ring Long Land Arc, the crew is doing Red Light Green Light with Foxy's crew as part of the Davy Back games. Despite the fact that it is daytime, the pathways they are taking are surrounded by water, and there is no way to get lost whatsoever, Zoro <em>still</em> goes the wrong direction and ends up at the only dead-end on the paths. He can literally see the finish line and all he has to do is walk in that direction, and he still had no idea how to get there with a straight shot.
</li><li> It's lampshaded in the SBS for volume 85, when one reader asked who would win in a fifty-meter race (Brook, because he's the lightest). Zoro is ranked fifth, and it's said he'd get higher, but he got lost. It also says he'd do better in a shorter one where he wouldn't run off the track due to his poor sense of direction.
</li></ul></li><li> Luffy (pictured above, bottom of image), thinks the best way to find "south" is to head in the direction it's warmest. It's so bad that in the anime version, even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator">narrator</a> gives up on them.
</li><li> Chopper, who is also on the page picture, does not have a bad sense of direction per se (his is probably quite average). He is just very fearful, and as the forest the four characters were traversing was full of dangerous enemies, he got so scared that he just ran off without noticing where he was going.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnneHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnneHappy">Anne Happy</a></em>, Hibiki has one of the worst senses of direction ever. On several occasions people have pointed out a destination that's in her sight, and she thanks them, turns around and runs in the opposite direction; she then later blames the people who gave her directions for getting her lost. She always gives herself at least three hours to get to school on account of this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BGataHKei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BGataHKei">B Gata H Kei</a></em>, Miyano Mayu's lack of a sense of direction has reached impossible levels, to the point that at one point Kanejo opens a secret room protected by numerous barriers which only she can open, and Mayu walks out from <em>inside</em> this room no one could even know about crying and wondering how she got so lost.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, Kenpachi Zaraki is so bad at this that has to rely on Yachiru for guidance. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlindLeadingTheBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlindLeadingTheBlind">Unfortunately, she is just as bad as him</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Small wonder, considering she's actually the manifestation of Nozarashi, Kenpachi's Zanpakuto; her form, personality and powers were shaped by his soul imprinting its essence on the nameless Zanpakuto he took for himself.</span> The fact that Seireitei is built like a huge labyrinth makes both worse but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">doesn't slow them down any.</a>

He never seems to mind, even sleeping outside or under bridges without complaint when he can't find his way to lodging.
</li><li> There is also Sendo Takeshi, who seems to get lost despite being from Japan (admittedly a different region from Ippo). He relies on cats to tell him where to go and sometimes just wanders until he finds what he is looking for. At one point he ran right past a boxing gym he had been to on several occasions.

It eventually cost him his sense of direction. He can get lost, it is said, within thirty paces. The only exceptions are if it's an emergency — when he discovers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shuurei has been kidnapped</span>, he's able to rush directly to Shuurei's rooms without incident — and, for some reason, if he's drunk.

Then she traveled to Washington DC, where she got her car demolished (again). From there she took a train to Chicago (Which was hijacked and totaled en route). At this point, the Order got sick of the damage caused by her meandering journey and chartered a plane to take her to California.

</li><li> 1/1/29: During the Rose Bowl, California Bear Roy Riegels picked up a fumble and began running to his own end zone before he was stopped by a teammate at his own 1-yard line. The following punt was blocked and recovered by the Yellow Jackets for a safety — the ultimate difference in an 8-7 Georgia Tech win. Riegels picked up the nickname "Wrong Way" ever since.
</li><li> 10/25/64: Minnesota Vikings defensive end Jim Marshall picked up a fumble and ran to the end zone (his own, that is), giving the 49ers two points on a safety when he tossed the ball away thinking it was a touchdown. Thankfully for Marshall, his team still won the game, in part because he made a critical defensive play later on.
</li><li> 9/30/12: Kent State player Andre Parker recovered a muffed punt, only to run in the wrong direction. He returned it 58 yards, going the wrong way, until he was stopped by 2 Towson players who had grabbed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> themselves. Fortunately, college football rules state that a muffed punt can't be advanced (or retreated), so Kent State didn't lose any field position and they would go on to win handily.
</li><li> When the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were an expansion team in 1976, their first game was played in the Houston Astrodome. They couldn't find their way from the locker room to the field, and <em>almost missed the kickoff</em>. Keep in mind that expansion team rosters are stocked with players from existing teams: a couple of the Buccaneers had formerly played for the Houston Oilers, whose home stadium was the Astrodome, and who played seven games there every season. Even if one considers that they only knew how to find their way from the <em>home</em> locker room, that doesn't excuse the ten or so former Cincinnati Bengals on the team, who as division rivals played a game there every season. Plus, the Bucs were held scoreless in the game, meaning that once on the field, they couldn't find the end zone.
</li><li> Miami Dolphins defensive end T.J. Turner was nicknamed "Wrong Way T.J." after flipping his vehicle at a highway exit ramp in West Palm Beach.

<ul><li> Famed aviator Douglas "Wrong Way" Corrigan: Denied permission to fly the Atlantic by the FAA in 1938, he took off after angrily declaring his intention to return home to Long Beach, California. He landed in Ireland 28 hours and 18 minutes later, claiming he'd flown the wrong way. Wrong Way Corrigan lived until 1995 and never once admitted that his transatlantic flight was anything other than an accident. Several fictional characters on this page were named in his honor.
</li><li> There is a Russian saying for No Sense of Direction meaning "to lose one's way in a three-pine forest". There are many more colorful idioms out there for describing the trope. One of the most common in English being not being able to "find one's butt with both hands", sometimes with "and a road map" thrown in for emphasis.
</li><li> In Japanese the word "houkouonchi" literally means "directionally tone-deaf", and is used more idiomatically to call someone an idiot.
</li><li> This is the reason why turn-by-turn GPS units are so popular.
<ul><li> And even then, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">Artificial Stupidity</a> rears its ugly head, and they start giving you idiotic or even impossible routes.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the common reasons that people fail the driving test is that they may drive fine but find it hard to follow directions, especially while nervous and under pressure.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_topographical_disorientation">Developmental Topographical Disorientation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a cognitive disorder which causes people to literally have <em>no</em> sense of direction  not just being bad at finding new places, but being unable to orient themselves in their own house or neighborhood.
</li><li> People who are not right/left-dominant often have trouble telling right from left because the "wiring in the brain" is crisscrossed. They frequently have trouble with directions that include turn left, or will give directions like turn towards the old red barn. This often applies to people with autism.
<ul><li> Yet many of these same people will score perfectly at navigation if you use compass directions.
</li></ul></li><li> Norbert Weiner, a famed mathematician and inventor of the field of Cybernetics, and one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">better-known real-world examples</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor">Absent-Minded Professor</a> trope, had so much trouble finding his way around the offices at MIT that he would use the 'right hand rule' for closed mazes to navigate the hallways: he would put his right hand out, with a book in the other hand, and walk along the rooms with his index finger running along the walls, and would keep walking until he found himself in his office. He was known for walking into, around, and out of offices and classrooms this way, never saying a word or taking his eyes off of the book.
<ul><li> An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> says that he once got lost on his way back home, and stopped to ask a young girl for directions, saying, "Young lady, would you know where the famous mathematician Norbert Weiner lives?" Her reply was, "This way, Daddy, Momma sent me to find you." However, his daughter has denied that this ever happened, saying that no matter how lost he got, he always recognized his children.
</li></ul></li><li> It is said that if you lose a pet skunk, you probably will never see it again for this reason. Though it's more likely that the skunk just decided to strike out on its own given that skunks aren't domestic animals and don't have the instinct to seek out humans the way a dog or even a cat would.
