This can come across as slightly disingenuous if the hero has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsAMook">slaughtered his way through dozens of faceless mooks</a> just to reach the villain, only to hesitate or spare him at the end because "killing is wrong." In such a scenario, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> can make the disparity make sense. From a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">Doylist</a> perspective, it is also a common justification for maintaining a villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Joker Immunity</a>.

When Retsu Kaio returns the returns a beating to him, Katsumi enters the scene and soaks Dorian with gasoline and is about to torch him, when he suddenly stops and says that if set him on fire, he would cease to be a true Karateka, so he walks away. Then he goes: "Actually, that wouldn't bother me at all." Cue the BBQ/delicious subversion.

As Conan points out, Mr. Takei may be a greedy bastard, but he's still the only family his daughter Naoko (the subject of the episode's titular case) has, and if Akiko kills him, she'll be doing the same thing to Naoko that he did to her.

<ul><li> When Vegeta is finally taken down by Son Goku and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>, he tries to crawl back to his space pod and make his escape. Kuririn grabs Yajirobe's katana, intending to put the heavily wounded Vegeta down once and for all. But Goku stops Kuririn and asks him to let Vegeta live. In some versions of the English dub, he justifies this by telling Kuririn that killing Vegeta in cold blood will make them just as bad as he is. The original story averts this, however: Goku doesn't care about the morals of the situation, he only wants Vegeta to live so he can fight him again, even though he knows this potentially puts the Earth at tremendous risk. Goku even admits this is a selfish request.
</li><li> Goku decides not to finish off Freeza after defeating him in battle, which is an extremely hard decision for him to make. He even gives him some of his energy. However, when Freeza uses the donated energy to attack Goku one last time, Goku changes his mind and goes for the killing blow after all. Only later do we find out that Freeza survived it.

Scar adds an extra spin by pointing out that if Roy goes through with it, he'll be just like <em>him</em>. For added nuance, the reason for this isn't because he was going to horribly torture him, since at that point it would be near impossible to hurt <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Envy</span> without killing him anyway, but because of the reasons for doing so. Roy was going to kill him for personal reasons like vengeance instead of duty, and since his goal was to become <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leader of the country</span>, he simply can't afford to become the sort of person ruled by his emotions, and specially by bad ones like anger and revenge.

Scar states outright that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseKillMeIfItSatisfiesYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseKillMeIfItSatisfiesYou">she has every right to do so</a>, but Ed vehemently protests against doing so, talking her down while Al chases Scar off.
<div class="indent"><strong>Winry</strong>: But that man... You said that he was the one who killed my mom and dad. He tried to kill you and Al too, Ed. But I couldn't... why not? <br/><strong>Ed</strong>: Remember in Rush Valley? You delivered that baby, you saved two lives. And you gave me an arm, and a leg, to replace the ones I lost. It's your hands. They weren't meant to kill. They're meant to give life. That's why.

"It would be the most logical and secure route, but we can't go about it that way," she said as though trying to convince herself. "If we were to kill him, we would be no better than them. Our organization would lose all meaning." Sousuke is slightly skeptical about this (seeing how Kalinin, his adoptive father whom he was always taking orders from, undoubtedly would have done what he was about to do), but nevertheless follows orders, seeing how he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">doesn't really care either way</a>. Of course, later on, the fact that she let Takuma live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">led to a</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">huge</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">amount of destruction</a>...

<div class="indent"> <strong>Wolverine</strong>: Heck, they killed your parents. It's a good killin', ain't it? Ain't it? <br/><strong>Jubilee</strong>: You kill people! You've killed so many, and... <br/><strong>Wolverine</strong>: Yeah. You wanna sit up some night with me and talk to all of 'em?

<div class="indent"><strong>Kitty</strong>: It was very close. I wanted to so much — Logan, what if I had...?! <br/><strong>Wolverine</strong>: *wordlessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">retracts his claws</a>*

The rest of the team go after her, prepared to cite this trope at her, when they discover that she never intended to kill the guy.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Synch</strong>: We were afraid that, hanging with Wolverine, you would have wanted to... <br/><strong>Jubilee</strong>: You guys don't get it, do you? It's <strong>because</strong> of Wolverine that I won't kill.
</div></li><li> Everyone's favorite many angled one, Shuma-Gorath, is immortal for this very reason — anyone who kills him will start to become a new Shuma-Gorath (unless they have a similar level of immortality). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> took his own life rather than allow that to happen, which <em>still</em> didn't work.

Ratchet tries to give this speech to First Aid when the latter wants to go track down and kill one of the arc's villains, but the latter ain't buying it.
<div class="indent"><strong>Ratchet:</strong> <strong>No.</strong> If we kill him, we're no better than him.

<div class="indent"><strong>Snape:</strong> Voldemort used to go to Muggle villages just to kill people. He sought to hurt as many people as possible. He targeted men, women, and children indiscriminately. He made no distinction between Auror and civilian. He wanted a high body count and when attacked, would use Muggles as shields. It is <em>never</em> acceptable to deliberately kill people who have done you no harm and who are just going about their daily business. <br/>Aurors, by contrast, may kill in the line of duty, but they do it to protect civilians. In the war, they did not deliberately target the children of Death Eaters, while the Dark Lord and his followers attacked many families just as he did yours. It is ridiculous to say that any death is a tragedy or that all deaths are morally equivalent. There are people who, by their own actions, deserve to die, and killing someone in order to protect yourself or the innocent, is <em>not</em> murder.

Superman tells Wanda of Magneto's past as a Holocaust survivor and how it turned him into what he is, and admits that he probably does deserve to die for his crimes, but also that killing for revenge, justified or not, is a very slippery rope, and she's risking going down the same path as her father if she lets her hatred take over. She ultimately relents and decides to let Magneto live.

"Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side." Luke takes note of what he has just done (cut off his father's hand), looks down at his own robotic hand, and realizes that he is well on his way to doing just that. Then he throws away his lightsaber.
<div class="indent"><strong>Luke</strong>: Never. I'll never turn to the darkside.
</div><ul><li> It's not specifically <em>killing</em> that Jedi must avoid (though they certainly <em>prefer</em> non-lethal options whenever possible). Jedi can and do kill when there's no other option, and Luke had certainly killed before. It's killing <em>out of hatred</em> that leads a Force-sensitive to the Dark Side. And since the Dark Side is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">highly addictive</a>, once a Jedi turns down that path it's very difficult for them to turn back. Luke was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfHate">consumed by rage</a> when he overpowered Vader and was on the verge of killing him, so going through with the act would've corrupted him to the point that Palpatine might well have been able to convert him into a new Sith Lord.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a> universe, the highly addictive nature of black magic means the White Council enforces this for any type of magical killing of a human.

<ul><li> It's worth noting that this applies specifically to using <em>magic</em> to kill. The Council couldn't care less about a wizard using mundane means like, say, a <em>gun</em> to do the same and is itself altogether too fond of enforcing its own death penalties for breaking the Laws of Magic (typically by beheading) even at the first offense for Harry's comfort. This is because any magic which breaks said Laws results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">The Corruption</a>, which is permanent and cannot be removed.

First Mate Cox is cruel and evil, enjoying killing simply for the joy of it. When he mutinied against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodCaptain">The Good Captain</a>, said captain nearly fell for this trope.

"The billions who live forever will be a monument to my work, and the billions who are murdered to buy that immortality will be the continuance of my work. Not like us? You will <em>become</em> us."

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played bizarrely straight (and by a character who should have known better); an episode of the second season ends with one of the agents pondering, apropos of almost nothing, how much difference there REALLY is between the offenders that they hunt, and the agents themselves. In this corner, an antisocial, sociopathic recidivist murderer who was abused by his parents for fifteen years and slaughters innocent women purely for the sexual thrill that it gives him. In the opposite side, an agent with ten or fifteen years of experience in fieldwork with the FBI who is willing to fire their weapon ONLY in cause of self-defence or the preservation of another life (and even then, only with utmost angst over the decision afterward), and who has dedicated their professional life to the incarceration of those who would commit such heinous crimes. Yeah, that's a real slippery slope right there.
</li><li> In an episode of season three, a man takes it upon himself to rescue his kidnapped daughter, but is interrupted from killing him by Agent Reid, who tells the man that if he kills the kidnapper, he'll introduce a cycle of violence into his daughter's life. As he pleads with the father, asking him when the violence will stop, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the man whispers, "Tomorrow," and shoots the kidnapper in the head</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, where the highly moral Doctor often must make a difficult decision between killing his enemies (technically a violation of his principles, though he's forced to do so more often than not) or showing mercy at the risk of them going on to hurt others.

<ul><li> Uncle Jesse has instilled in his nephews, Bo and Luke, that for as wily as Boss Hogg is and for as much grief and trouble as he and Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane has caused the Duke family through the years — simple harassment to outright framing the Duke boys for various crimes to trying to illegally foreclose on their property — they have a moral obligation and duty to rescue and aid Hogg (and/or Rosco, when necessary) whenever their lives are threatened. Jesse has told Bo and Luke that, if they were ever to allow Boss or Rosco to die at the hands of criminals, they would be disinherited and disowned as they would be just as responsible for allowing their deaths to happen as if they had pulled the trigger themselves.
</li><li> In the Season 2 episode "Grannie Annie", after Boss is kidnapped by a counterfeiter and his bodyguard who plans to brutally kill him (after believing he double-crossed him), Rosco begs Bo and Luke to go after the counterfeiter and save Boss' life; Bo and Luke balk and all but outright refuse, but after Rosco gives a tear-stained, impassioned plea telling them that if they don't go after Boss' captors and allow him to be killed, he will hold them accountable for the rest of their lives and never forgive them ... and (although unstated) they will be just as bad as Boss was.

Of course, even if he had been able to overcome <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the chip</span>, it probably wouldn't have done much good, because as soon as Crichton has left the room, Scorpius casually reveals that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellBentForLeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellBentForLeather">gimp suit</a> can't be so easily dissolved by the acid.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>, Vic Mackey regularly breaks the law to catch criminals. One could argue that he's better than the criminals, because he's breaking the law to keep his precinct safe. But then Internal Affairs lieutenant Kavanaugh develops a vendetta against him, and resorts to breaking the law to bring him down. So... he becomes a corrupt cop to bring down a corrupt cop. One of the most justified examples of "You will be no better than him", since if you think that breaking the law to catch a criminal is acceptable, then Vic should be allowed to do his thing. And if you think that it's not acceptable, then Kavanaugh's actions are not justified. <br/><br/>Of course, Vic Mackey doesn't just bend the rules to get results. He pulls heists to enrich himself (such as the Armenian money train) and even murdered a fellow detective just to protect himself and his questionable methods (which Kavanaugh seeks to prove). He goes out of his way to antagonize Kavanaugh (such as sleeping with his mentally-ill ex-wife and bragging about it to him). Kavanaugh may have crossed the line in "framing a guilty man" and ultimately paid with his career and freedom for his transgressions, but he avoided the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>.

<ul><li> Said word for word in "Fragile" by Clark to convince a second generation meteor freak not to kill her similarly-powered father.
</li><li> One of the only times Clark has intentionally killed an opponent was when he faced the alien warrior, Titan. Clark reflects that, for a moment, he actually <em>enjoyed</em> it. He also clearly killed Brainiac (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">or tried to</a>), rationalizing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">machines aren't alive</a>.
</li><li> In a different twist, Chloe tries to convince Clark that Lex is a big threat and Clark can't just let him walk away.

</li><li> A postmortem version. Clark says something like this after he finds out that Oliver killed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lex Luthor</span>.

They begin to walk away but then Daniel suddenly turns and fires at the vat anyway, killing the symbiotes.
<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>, Shephard and Michael fight on the roof-tops. Michael hangs from the roof by his finger-nails. Earlier in the episode, Michael had threatened Teyla's baby. Teyla stamps on one hand and then the other; Michael falls to his doom. Mom morality pwns Hollywood morality.
</li><li> This is part of the philosophy of the Ancients in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>. They believe in the free will of every being and even though they have the power to eliminate every threat in the galaxy, they still don't do it. This, however is taken to such an extreme that one can only declare them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">guilty</a>.
<ul><li> Then again, later seasons reveal the existence of the Ancients' evil counterparts, the Ori. A rival group of ascended beings who are more than happy to maintain complete control within their galaxy by enslaving <em>everyone</em>. The Ancients were actually exiled by them because of this difference in philosophy, so it makes sense the Ancients themselves would be really worried about slipping down the slope if they start interfering and solving mortals' problems. They <em>do</em> prevent the Ori from acting directly in our galaxy, but the Ori's followers are free-willed (if misled) mortals, so the Ancients don't do anything to stop them.
</li><li> The slight flaw in this argument is that many of the "threats" arise from leftover Ancient technology strewn all over the galaxy, thus providing countless opportunities for younger species to advance their technology far ahead of their morality. If the Ancients had bothered to clean up after themselves, their hands-off policy would be more laudable.

When Garrus points out the futility of trying to arrest him, when he just ended up dead <em>anyway</em>, Paragon Shepard reasons that while they can't always predict other people's actions, that doesn't mean they should stoop to the same level.

If we allow our passions to turn to bloodlust, then we will become as vile as the Orcs". This is proved right as Arthas becomes obsessed with destroying Mal'ganis and upon defeating him with Frostmourne, becomes the commander of the Undead Scourge, who ironically replace the orcs as the antagonists of the series.
<ul><li> In Tides of War, Jaina temporarily becomes racist and almost wipes out Orgrimmar. Kalec and Thrall point out that if she does this she'll be no better than Arthas (in fact, given that Arthas was acting out of a misguided sense of compassion, she'd be worse.) Fortunately it gets through to her, and she calms down to the point where she's still mad, but no longer racist.

Aang, a pacifist monk, agonizes about how he can stop main villain Ozai without killing him. When Aang consults with the avatars of his former lives on what to do, the show subverts this trope: as Chosen One, Aang's duty is to protect the world - if the only way to save countless lives and stop Ozai is to kill him, Aang must do it, even if it means sacrificing his own personal convictions. Even the previous airbender Avatar, who shared Aang's pacifist spiritual beliefs as an Air Nomad, told him that an Avatar has to place the good of the world above his own spiritual well-being, and if a threat to the world is so extreme that it's impossible to defeat non-lethally, it becomes his duty to kill.
