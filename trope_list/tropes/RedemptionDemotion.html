To set a villain apart from being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villain</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil">or otherwise being comedic</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">they are built up as the equal or superior to all of the heroes combined</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">a serious threat to their team</a>. Often, they're far and away the strongest of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMinions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMinions">Evil Minions</a> our heroes have faced thus far.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">And then they switch sides</a>, and they lose their powers. Suddenly, they're not substantially stronger than the others, and may be <em>less</em> powerful than the leader of the heroes. From a story telling perspective, it's more dramatic to have the villains be a threat to our heroes. But if the reformed villain remains more powerful than the hero, then the villain will outshine the hero and solve problems that the hero is supposed to solve. The depowering of the villain prevents the heroes from dominating their opponents.

</p><ul><li> They lose access to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">information network, resources, or manpower provided by their former side</a>.
</li><li> They suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap">some kind of major loss or wound</a> in the process of turning good (whether through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">the heroes</a>, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">former allies</a>, or some unrelated faction), impeding their effectiveness badly through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a> or the absence of their awesome gear.
</li><li> They isolate and confine their previous evil urges and habits into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> that only occasionally rears its head and/or they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">The Fettered</a>.
</li><li> If they were already relying on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>, they resolve to never use it again (or at least reserve it for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">emergency use only</a>).
</li><li> If they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">being driven insane by a source of power</a>, curing them of the problem may render them sane enough to join <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, but will probably deprive them of that power too.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> If they were using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a> or some other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">inherently evil</a> power and have now decided to leave it behind, this also obviously deprives them of their former power. (Unless, of course, the situation crosses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten">Friction with new, untrusting allies</a> as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingEvilSucks">feelings of personal guilt and shame</a> can leave <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>'s new buddy handicapped by insecurity.
</li><li> In a story where the heroes are growing in strength, skill, or resources, the villain may have been formidable once, but now they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoLastSeason">So Last Season</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a>. They haven't gotten any weaker; they only seem weaker because they no doubt surpassed the heroes for most of their villainous tenure, and that's no longer the case (especially since such storylines tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">have the villain be surpassed before they switch sides</a>).
</li></ul><p>However, sometimes no explanation is given at all. It could be worse though; if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel Face Turner</a> is particularly unlucky, they'll just suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a> and that will be the end of it. Sometimes, a new ally goes through enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> (or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>) to acquire some new, heroic ability to replace their old ways, and can contribute to the cause from then on. This trope can apply in reverse to characters traveling the other way, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Evil Is Cool</a>. A character that does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> will often find that they suddenly have access to much larger levels of power, possibly enough to take down their entire former team single-handedly.
</p><p>Very common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">RPGs</a>, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">"playable" versions of the characters</a> tend to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry">many fewer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>, fewer and less impressive abilities, and generally worse stats than the "boss" versions (bosses are often balanced around facing a squad of heroes alone, after all). In older games, they even got <em>physically smaller</em>, since hero sprites were much smaller than enemy ones. Usually, this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, since it wouldn't exactly be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsEasySoItSucks">very fun to just pick "Mind Erasing Maimblaster" over and over again</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, nearly all of Goku's allies were at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rivals</a> to him, and frequently outright villains, when first introduced, and were credible threats to him. But after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> kicked in, they were quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">left in the dust</a> by Goku. Though this is more because they weren't able to keep up to the stronger villains being faced ahead.
<ul><li> The debut of Yamcha. While initially posing a threat to Goku, then turning good, and saving everyone from the final threat (Goku in a Were creature form ironically), Yamcha often takes a backseat afterwards, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">losing to the Big Bads of the tournament storyline</a>, eventually rapidly fading from relevance.
</li><li> Ditto Tenshinhan, who permanently crippled his first on-screen opponent, nearly did the same to Yamcha, and stood toe-to-toe with Goku in their first fight (and technically won), yet was quickly banished to Jobberdom. Only stayed in the big leagues due to his Kikouhou/Tri-Beam, which literally sapped the life from him. (And even then, later on, it was only good enough to sucker-punch Super Buu, who swiftly - and apparently permanently - returned the favor.) In particular, he also seems to forget about a lot of his old moves, including limb duplication, the Dodonpa, Solar Flare/Taiyouken, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No Selling</a> ki attacks, and the Multiform, in favor of just spamming Kikouhous.
</li><li> Which is more than can be said for Chaozu, who didn't even win a single fight at all. That said, Tenshinhan, Yamcha and Chaozu <em>do</em> get a bit of redemption in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a> episode where King Kai makes them go up against the Ginyu Force as a means of testing their training. And what's more, they <strong>win</strong>.
</li><li> Vegeta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonballZ">Dragonball Z</a></em> had destroyed dozens of planets, but when he turned good, he was left permanent second-banana to Goku. At one point, he willingly becomes a minion of the current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, pointing out that as a hero, he could only ever be second-rate, but he was a <em>damned good</em> villain. That Vegeta is a better villain than hero is further highlighted by the fact that shortly after this he makes a <em>second</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, in which he attempts to save the world via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. And fails. While he never really loses any power per se, he simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> to Goku's increasing power.
</li><li> Even Majin Buu suffers from this midway through his own saga, as his attempts to go good are immediately followed by the evil parts of his heart besting him in combat and absorbing him. After he frees himself, he's mostly used to distract Kid Buu so that he can't interrupt Goku's charging of the Spirit Bomb, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, he doesn't partake in combat, instead fusing with Uub to give him a needed power boost (which still wasn't enough to take down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of that saga without Goku's help).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> was all set to bring him back on stage twice, but both times he literally fell asleep and missed out. He even trained in preparation for the 2nd, shedding his Fat Buu form for a form named offscreen as Fit Buu which resembled Super Buu. He did get in on one exhibition fight before transforming into Fit Buu which gave glimpses he still held amazing power, but never gets to show it off in favor of giving Freeza of all characters the spotlight.

On paper, once he's been purified and joined the good guys, he didn't lose any power, managing to defeat an opponent who knocked out the whole team.

</li><li> Zelgadis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, to a certain extent. While shown to have impressive powers while he still opposes the group and/or is in the plot's spotlight, once he joins the party he becomes close to useless combat-wise. Whenever he attacks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfBarrage">the attack usually accomplishes nothing, if only to show how powerful their adversary is</a>. Also, his demonic ability to move faster than the eye can track seems to be largely forgotten, as it never allows him to dodge out of the way of incoming cannon blasts or spells while the rest of the party are unable to. The times when he <em>does</em> accomplish something in battle, it's usually something another character could've done just as well, be it shield or levitation. However, his decreasingly important role in battle is somewhat redeemed by the sheer variety of his skills, the hardiness of his stony skin (which enables him to take a cannonball to the head only to have it <em>bounce off</em>) and the fact that he's pretty much the only mature one in the group and often makes important discoveries and observations that the others had missed.

As an ally to the Batfamily Clayface was decidedly useful, but as a <em>combatant</em> he was somewhat less effective due to now having to hold back his powers.
</li><li> Damian Wayne the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">fifth</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Robin">Robin</a> got this when he became a good guy, since he was raised and trained as an assassin by his mother and Batman's strict adherence to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> renders most of his former strategies moot; though he's still as strong and smart as he's always been, he's still a ten year old who <em>will</em> have issues against supervillains like say, Killer Croc and Bane.

In this state, he was a stronger and more aggressive version of Captain America who had a great deal of trouble bringing him down. Once USAgent calmed down a little, joined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>, and became more of a standard hero, he was quickly turned into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Captain America-lite</a>. In one issue, Captain America was implied to be stronger despite USAgent having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> as opposed to Cap who is "simply" peak human.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> villain Starro joined the Team Mystery spinoff of the League; as Starro is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GalacticConqueror">Galactic Conqueror</a> most of the time, this has obvious problems. Therefore, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkNightsMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkNightsMetal">Dark Nights: Metal</a></em>, which takes place right beforehand, he was shown to have been nearly-killed and currently regenerating, making him considerably smaller and weaker than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">his usual proportions</a>, and being a lot younger, he's a fair bit less mature personality-wise.

On the plus side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">he can speak telepathically now</a>.

As a hero, he often ends up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">Worf Effect</a> situations and is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">not as powerful</a>.

<ul><li> The Molten Man was a pretty tough villain for Spidey, but when he reformed he was often at the receiving end of beatings from Harry Osborn during his more villainous days (they were brothers-in-law). These beatings were pretty one-sided, defying Molten Man's past showings.
</li><li> Classic Spidey villain the Sandman also found himself afflicted by this during the (respectably lengthy) period when he was trying to reform as a reserve member of the Avengers.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>:
<ul><li> Juggernaut was literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">an unstoppable force</a>. Basically the only way to defeat him was to trick him into going away (or to remove his telepathy-blocking helmet, but getting the thing off generally necessitated a battle royale). After going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">Wonderful Life</a> montage, he repented his evil ways and joined the good guys' side. Despite formerly being able to take out entire teams of superheroes by himself, he was now having trouble taking on solo villains as 'part' of a team. (When Juggernaut was at his most evil he could go toe-to-toe with Hulk or Thor, when he was at his most good with New Excalibur he got his ass handed to him by the Wrecking Crew, a C-list group of super thugs.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that the evil god who gave Juggernaut his powers was displeased by his servant's kinder, gentler personality and was slowly removing his powers. He later made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and scaled back up to his full power.
</li><li> Long-time adversary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> is one of the most powerful mutants in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>... except when he switches sides. He's still impressive, but 'standard team member' strength rather than 'guy who has curb-stomped the lot of them <em>repeatedly</em>' strength. Justified, up to a point, by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">using his powers at high levels messes with Magneto's brain chemistry and makes him act crazy</a>. In other words, when he's on the hero side (and therefore at his sanest) he needs to hold himself back to avoid going over the edge again.
</li><li> The few times that Magneto's daughter, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a>, has gone insane and became evil, she turned into a force of nature. When she's a hero, her abilities wax and wane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>.
</li><li> It must be a genetic thing. When Magneto's other daughter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PolarisMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PolarisMarvelComics">Polaris</a>, first showed up as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> villain, she was as powerful as Magneto himself. After she snapped out of it and joined the X-Men - not so much.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a> gets the short end of the stick powers-wise among his family, but he was a match for entire teams during the time that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Inhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Inhumans">Maximus</a> was screwing with his mind (and even managed to take down the amazingly powerful Exodus after being powered up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Isotope E</a>). As an Avenger, it's hard to imagine. (However, in his early appearances, he <em>wasn't</em> that powerful as a member of the Brotherhood.)
</li><li> In her first appearance, a villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Rogue">Rogue</a> took on the Avengers all by herself and was a major force in her early encounters with the X-Men. Then she joins the X-Men and is thereafter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">beaten up by all subsequent villains to show how tough they are</a> (okay, slight exaggeration). Justified (a bit) by her being less willing to use her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">increasingly dangerous absorption powers</a>.
</li><li> In the regular timeline the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> mutant Exodus is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> winner who is easily one of the most powerful mutants around. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em> a kindler, gentler Magneto inducts Exodus into the X-Men (unlike the regular timeline's Magneto who radicalizes Exodus into mutant supremacy) but as the tradeoff he also affixes Exodus with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> devices to keep him from being corrupted by his own power. The result is an Exodus that, while being significantly more stable and less prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">Black and White Insanity</a> than the mainstream version, is also significantly less powerful.
</li></ul></li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> series, Alex was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>, brilliantly playing his friends against their own parents as part of a plot to make him and his family rich and powerful. In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerManAndIronFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerManAndIronFist">Power Man And Iron Fist</a></em>, he managed to play two gangs against each other. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RainbowRowellsRunaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RainbowRowellsRunaways">Rainbow Rowell's Runaways</a></em>, he cons his way back onto the team... and mostly ends up babysitting Molly or attempting poorly-planned betrayals. Possibly justified in that most of Alex's talents require that he be in a position of leadership, whereas none of the other Runaways are willing to listen to him anymore.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MightyAvengers">Mighty Avengers</a></em> this happend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Ares">Ares</a>. As a villain, he'd been a major threat who'd killed more people than nearly the entire rest of the Avengers' foes combined. As an Avenger, despite being described as "like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> combined," he never accomplished anything except to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">embarassingly beaten up</a> by whatever the latest foe they were facing was, and he was ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> as a means of showing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSentry">The Sentry</a> had finally snapped and gone into full villain mode.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Film </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One of the worst examples of this is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiamondsAreForever">Diamonds Are Forever</a></em>. The main Bond girl is Tiffany Case, a professional diamond smuggler. In the first half of the film, she's shown to be a seasoned pro, good at her criminal work, with enough authority to even have her own henchmen. Late in the film, she successfully (and cleverly) eludes a crowded auditorium loaded with CIA agents ready to arrest her. After she turns good, her brains go south, particularly over a mix-up with cassette tapes. This prompts both Bond <em>and</em> Blofeld to make snide remarks about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">what an "idiot" she is.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> villain King Ghidorah, despite significant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> over the years (it used to take 2-3 monsters just to stand a chance against him), still generally managed to put up a good fight against Godzilla (even in the Hesei film, he managed to strangle Godzilla until soap suds came out). But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaMothraKingGhidorahGiantMonstersAllOutAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaMothraKingGhidorahGiantMonstersAllOutAttack">Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack!</a></em>, he was one of the good monsters, and got profoundly curbstomped. Then he came back from the dead stronger, and got curbstomped, AGAIN. Then he came back, even stronger, and he got curbstomped a third time. Originally, lower-tier monsters were supposed to be used in place of Ghidora and Mothra, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Toho execs wanted to use their most popular monsters</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboundHellraiserII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellboundHellraiserII">Hellbound: Hellraiser II</a></em> presents an extremely glaring example. Near the climax, the heroine talks the four main Cenobites of the previous film- including Pinhead, the series' most popular villain- into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> by reminding them they were once human. Minutes later, they are unceremoniously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomped</a> by a newly-converted and thoroughly evil Cenobite.

Justified because he initially uses a lot of external sources of power (the Casket, the Destroyer, the Bifrost, the Tesseract, the Scepter, alien army) which he later stops relying on, and Thor wisens up to his tricks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em>, Wanda Maximoff (aka Scarlet Witch) is able to take down every member of the Avengers (except Hawkeye) by using her telepathic abilities to induce fear and visions of longing or foreboding.

Justified given that she's horrified when she realizes that the conflict in <em>Age of Ultron</em> was indirectly her fault. Her capabilities caused cracks on the team and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> lead Tony to create Ultron out of fear and paranoia</span>.

As part of his redemption, he attempts to resist the desire to drink human blood. Unfortunately, this leaves him weakened and vulnerable, and even his appearance suffers.

Then he gets his soul back, turns good and gets his original talent of having bad ideas back.
</li><li> While "redemption" is probably overstating the matter, Lady in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany">The Black Company</a></em> novels is a lot less powerful as a protagonist than she ever was as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>. Justified because her reign was ended by her being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>, meaning that she pretty much had to relearn all of her magical skills from scratch during the books where she was a main character. That said, once she regains a certain level of power she's <em>still</em> the most powerful individual protagonist, even if she's a lot less of a heavyweight than she was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though leeching power off Kina probably helped</span>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>, every single time they did the "evil ranger" plot. The original Green Ranger nearly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">killed</a></em> the heroes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">even in five-against-one fights</a>, but the second he switched sides, he was weakened immensely. Ditto the Titanium Ranger, the <em>Wild Force</em> Wolf Ranger, the Thunder Rangers, and <em>Dino Thunder</em>'s White Ranger.
<ul><li> The Green Ranger actually got handled pretty well, mainly because he was basically only called when the going got tough (read: damn near every battle). The only real thing he lost was the power of darkness, and the reason for that is obvious. When he became the White Ranger though...
</li><li> Justified with the Wildforce's Wolf Ranger, as his backstory showed he had a ranger-like form in the past that was no weaker or stronger than the other five; but had used a demonic artifact to grow stronger in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> scenario. It was the power of this artifact when added to his ranger powers that made him so strong when he was evil. When he became good again, is artifact driven power-up was lost and he reverted to his original ranger powers
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">Dino Thunder</a></em> is an odd duck, since in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BakuryuuSentaiAbaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BakuryuuSentaiAbaranger">the source material</a>, the White Ranger (Abarekiller) technically <em>never</em> joined the heroes. Thus, <em>Dino Thunder</em> had to resort to the plot of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> to justify all the footage where he fought the Rangers despite their version being forced to join the good guys earlier via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. Also his super-powerful Dino Gem was driving him evil, but when he was punished by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> via an energy draining device, <em>weakening</em> the gem led to him returning to normal... with powers reduced to standard Ranger level.
</li><li> It should be noted that when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> is <em>good</em> upon introduction, it's no different. He schools whatever enemy the starting five Rangers couldn't beat, looks awesome doing it, and it will continue in the next episode as we are getting properly introduced to the character. <em>Immediately</em> after that, he's no stronger than any of the main five, and is often even subjected to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens in <em>record</em> time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a>.</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga">Yuusuke</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a> and upgraded to Rising Ultimate Kuuga. He floors several Riders just by gesturing in their general direction. When he's restored to normal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlack">Shadow Moon</a> soon attacks and schools him and Decade easily.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>:
<ul><li> Wolfram &amp; Hart create a diversion to distract Angel while they extract vital information from Lorne's mind. Angel completely falls for this ruse despite its similarity to one that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Angelus</a> used on Buffy in "Becoming". Indeed, Angelus often seems a bit more clever than Angel. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade was hung</a> on this in Season 4, with Cordelia observing that Angelus is "smart" and Angel taking umbrage, and Wesley (the guy employed to be smart) outright states that Angelus is smarter than him.
</li><li> Connor personified this trope. As a conflicted character, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">constantly switching sides</a>; when fighting at his father's side he was a bit slower than Angel and not as agile, but when he fought <em>against</em> the good guys he was like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> with a cause, decking multiple foes with each blow and always one step ahead.
</li><li> Illyria, when she was first introduced, seemed as if she'd be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the 5th season, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">downright godlike</a> in her invincibility. Wolfram and Hart, the main villains of the entire series, were <em>collectively</em> so weak in comparison as to be like insects to her. There were other characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> who were <em>actual</em> gods, and Illyria could've overpowered any of them. Basically, she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Cthulhu</a> in a cute human girl's body. But when she ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">more or less on the heroes' side</a>, it's oh-so-coincidentally revealed that her new, human body can't handle that level of power, and she gets powered down to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> is able to beat her into the ground.
</li></ul></li><li> Meanwhile in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, Spike's fall was so severe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> was originally named after him. Eventually Buffy tells him "I want the Spike who's dangerous, the Spike who tried to kill me when we first met." She more-or-less gets him for the remainder of the series, as by then the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a> has rendered him barely effective.
<ul><li> Similarly, Anyanka becoming human and eventually good obviously cost her her demonic powers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which she gets back in the sixth season and uses in the finale to help defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> A particularly weird example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>. Peter and Sylar are both immensely powerful, but it's dealt with by keeping Sylar as a villain and handing Peter the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>. When Sylar was given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, the writers suddenly noticed the trope and turned him back in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon">hijack the plot</a>. As of the season 4 finale, they tried to redeem Sylar again, and started angsting about getting rid of his powers.
</li><li> Castiel suffered this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>'s fifth season. The show justified it by claiming that his powers were diminishing due to being cut off from Heaven.
</li><li> Allan-a-Dale from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em> became a lot less smart once he joined Guy of Gisborne and the Sheriff. The outlaws <em>still</em> managed to run rings around them, even though they were still using the techniques that Allan was familiar with. Of course, you could argue that Allan was deliberately sabotaging himself for the sake of his former friends...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> Both Blaine and Unique are hyped up as one-man juggernauts who can single-handedly lead a show choir performance that would wipe the floor with the One Directions (until they inevitably rediscover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a> and succeed against all odds). Once they actually join the ND? Relegated mostly to background status and barely getting more voice time than the (canonically much less skilled) average Joe in the New Directions, with Rachel still being worshipped as the true coming of show choir-Jesus by all characters.
<ul><li> Subverted somewhat in that Blaine did get some credit for being a high-tier performer in Seasons 3 and later, though nowhere near the level implied by his absolute lead-man status as a Warbler.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Tyrion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> spent the first few seasons being quite successful as a cynical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessMaster">chessmaster</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> using any and all means to achieve his ends. However, after he became inspired by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer">Daenerys</a> and started to believe that a better world was possible, he embarked on an endless losing streak wherein <em>every</em> clever plan he attempted invariably blew up in his face, and was at the end of the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenHero">Broken Hero</a> who admits that his supposed cleverness has led to nothing but disasters</span>. Sometimes, this arises from his failures coming from trusting people too much, or putting himself at a disadvantage to minimise casualties, but other instances are just regular old idiocy. Even Peter Dinklage called him out for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf">Teen Wolf</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Alpha twins Aiden and Ethan who work for Deucalion have the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">merge together into a large and powerful werewolf</a>. After almost dying against the Darach, they lose this ability by the time they join Scott's pack.
</li><li> Theo Raeken at the end of season 5 successfully absorbed the powers of his two packmates and was able to produce electricity and venom. In season 6, he's resurected without his powers and forced to team with the heroes.

(Although it has to be admitted he does have some interesting, potentially very powerful abilities.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> In 3rd Edition, normally, monstrous creatures (or just atypically powerful races) suited for use as player characters have "Level Adjustment", a number of "virtual" levels to count them as already having (added on to their racial hit dice) before adding class levels, to balance their innate prowess. In many cases, however, monsters' LA is badly overestimated. They often would have gained much more by an equivalent number of levels in an actual character class, meaning that when controlled by players, they often are very weak for the party's level. This problem can be exacerbated by racial hit dice, which provide the monster's core abilities (hit points, attack bonus, etc.) and count as effective levels, since they provide no other direct benefits and some racial HD types are vastly superior to others. Under-estimated LA, and/or very powerful HD types (dragons, outsiders, and magical beasts being strong contenders), and/or good synergy with class features can cause this to be inverted.
</li><li> More directly exemplified in the "Savage Species" supplement, which introduced an alternative to make monsters playable at low levels, by allowing you to gradually earn the abilities represented by a monster's level adjustment by gaining levels as a monster instead of in a character class. In short, the creature is intentionally demoted to bring them theoretically on par with normal characters, gaining portions of their full innate power instead of class levels. The aforementioned level adjustment just causes the monster to gain less than a conventional character might have, rather than actually demoting it.
</li><li> Vampires are by far the biggest sufferers, with a +8 Level Adjustment. A 1st-level vampire is the equivalent of a 9th-level character, but with only 12 HP, that vampire will have to retreat to his coffin whenever someone of his level so much as looks at him funny. (Even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> at that level will have around 30-40 HP.)
</li><li> Part of the problem is that some monsters have abilities which are pretty mundane in straightforward combat, but turn <em>devastating</em> in the hands of a player. For instance, many undead have a Create Spawn ability, which causes opponents slain by them to rise as similarly-powered undead under their control. In the hands of a wandering monster, this really just means that if one of the party somehow dies, things just got a bit harder. In the hands of a player, however, this is pretty much the key to creating an entire army by simply running through a town of commoners. Because of this, every undead with the Create Spawn ability winds up with LA so high that both them and their erstwhile army get one-hit-killed by anything level-equivalent for a player - compare the CR of a shadow (3, about equal with a grizzly bear or an ogre) with its ECL (10, meaning it should be fighting fire giants and adult white dragons with its 19 hit points).
</li></ul></li><li> Omnitron-X in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em> is theoretically more advanced than the various Omnitrons you face in play, but has less power because it needs to coexist with other heroes in the co-operative game: its components break more easily, its removal effects do less damage and destroy less, its plating is more limited and only lowers, rather than eliminates, damage, and it can't create drones. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>, though: Omnitron is a factory. Cosmic Omnitron is the size of a large vehicle. Omnitron-X is basically a mechanical human. There isn't <em>space</em> for drone factories or enormous railguns, so it has to make do with what it can fit on a humanoid form.
<ul><li> The Harpy (formerly the villain The Matriarch) is much less powerful than she was as a villain (game wise The Matriarch is a difficulty 4 villain, the highest difficulty). This is because she is purposely limiting her power due to disastrous things (like becoming a Super Villain) happening when she loses control.
</li><li> Lifeline (formerly the villain Deadline) is also less powerful due to lacking the device that lets him cause natural disasters on a whim.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcTheLad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcTheLad">Arc the Lad</a>: Twilight of the Spirits</em>, Tatjana as well as many of Darc's allies have this to some extent, but many of them have just had no real affiliation with the villains before meeting Darc, and Tatjana had merely been betrayed as a wake-up call. Tatjana is seen as one of Dilzweld's commanders and is capable of mutating a deimos into a state where it is completely unrecognizable. She is also fought as an enemy on Darc's side, but it is revealed that a lot of her power comes from having her advanced science (that is not portable) and from being able to command soldiers, since when she is a guest-party member in Kharg's group at first she is easily picked off by the boss monsters unless saved.

The party member has 3300 hit points during this battle. Now, the mechanics of the game are such that bosses don't have all that many more HP than the party members (the ratio is more like 3:1 rather than 20:1), and this party member <em>will</em> actually reach 3300+ HP in the course of the game (assuming you level her up), but at the time when this pitched battle occurs, it's still more than the high-three-digit HP values your party will probably have at that point in the story.
</li><li> As a boss, ISIC from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battleborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battleborn">Battleborn</a></em> is more than a challenge. As a playable character, he's just on par with the rest of the Battleborn.

During the game, he's quite a hard guy to defeat, using all kinds of weird powers. But at one point, after you defeat him, he realizes he's been brainwashed and adds his power to yours. But do you get any special board-game based attacks? Nope, you get to lay more bombs. The funny thing here is that you'd have to be more powerful than him to defeat him in the first place. Also, as soon as you next die or turn off the game, you <em>lose all that power</em>.

<ul><li> Justifying this trope makes up the opening to the game. Alucard, having chosen to renounce Dracula's ways prior to the start of the game, storms the castle with a few extremely powerful weapons, obliterating every single one of the first enemies in a single hit. The moment he meets Death and it's revealed what's going on, Death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">steals all of his weapons</a> and in the next room, the character who was mowing through giant beasts in a single sword swipe is now resorting to <em>punching a slow, weak zombie to death</em> just for a short sword.
</li><li> Inverted with Richter, whose powers as a vampire hunter would seem to prove very useful against Alucard when he's under the control of Shaft, but Richter is not particularly powerful or difficult as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">Disc-One Final Boss</a>.

This is explained by having his powers weakened by a Masamune beating and drained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Lavos</a>, since if you choose to fight him again he only uses the three spells he starts with if you recruit him. Meanwhile, the discrepancy in the stats are explained by simple game mechanics and ratios: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry">enemies and bosses have more HP, but the main characters do more damage</a>.
<ul><li> Sequel game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> also has several examples of this, due to the incredibly huge number of characters you can recruit. Probably the biggest example is Grobyc. As a boss, he has thousands of hit points and attacks that can annihilate your entire party repeatedly. Afterwards, he has the usual 400 or so HP and can no longer use the oh-so-broken Vigora.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a> II</em> has a weird example where the character in question doesn't switch sides. In <em>Chaos Rising</em> Ulkair is the most difficult boss in the entire series, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">health in the millions</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">area of effect attacks that will one-shot entire squads if they hit</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">frequently calls in elite units</a>.

They also used air support in the form of Blackhawks, which strafed zombie crowds with their machine guns, and actual tactics, such as remembering that they have <em>guns</em> and firing on the zombies from the roof. They even sent at least one tank. In the second game, their response consists of two eight man rescue teams, with no armor or air support, who just blindly rush in. Predictably, they get slaughtered. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sure, the zombies they were fighting were more dangerous than the ones that the last game's soldiers were fighting, but their new abilities wouldn't have mattered at all if the U.S. Military had the same response they did in the first game.</span>

You're prompted to fight them before they actually become playable, and while facing them as enemies, they sport very strong and rare weaponry, have the strongest weapon skills at their hand and have between 10.000 to 25.000 HP to boot. Once they become playable, they lose all their equipment, lose all of their weapon skills and their HP is cut down to an average of 3.000. Though as in the prior two games, once the character in question is yours, you can train the character back up and give them equipment that far outranks whatever they had as a boss. And when you eventually cycle back through the game and acquire them again, they'll be at the same level with all their gear.

However, when he joins Moon Tree, he becomes a pacifist and stops using it. When you get his member address to call him into your party, he can still only equip Steam Guns. The problem here is that Adept Rogues learn moves for their chosen weapon classes at a slower rate because their actual strength is their ability to use multiple weapons, so Matsu is essentially an extremely weak Steam Gunner in comparison to your other, <em>actual</em> Steam Gunner (though he has the ability to equip heavy armor, something steam gunners can't do).

Then you unlock him and get the version balanced like everyone else (however, since he's so cool as the NPC version, most people will mac him out ASAP anyway — but he's STILL not as tough as the NPC version. Though if played well with pre-considered access to Musou Rages and the right balance of magic stuff, he can sometimes kill his other self—just barely.
</li><li> Good luck getting Guan Yu to be as good as his Fan Castle iteration or Zhang Liao and Gan Ning to do the same for their He Fei forms. Generally if a general was famous for their actions at a specific battle they will get a huge power boost over their regular forms. This is even the case with Lu Bu; compare him at Hu Lao Gate to say Guan Du or the Imperial Seal and you'll notice a huge power difference.
</li><li> Partial exception: <em>Destiny of an Emperor</em> allows the player to recruit bosses at their full strength. However, since the main PCs gain soldiers (the game's equivalent of HP) over the course of the game and the bosses (and less important allies) don't, the bosses-turned-allies eventually become worthless. Except Zhou Yu.

</li><li> Some of the antagonists that experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a> such as Haman Kahn and Paptimus Scirocco experience this to a degree in their respective story modes for the sake of teaching them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ExitFate">Exit Fate</a></em>: when you defeat Vanrushal the vampire, the damage drains his power and leaves him on a "mere" human level. Since he finds you interesting and, more importantly, cannot stay at his monster-filled mansion like this, he joins your army instead. In other words, his demotion causes him to join you, not the other way around.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em> is a pretty textbook example. If you fight a Servant, chances are that they'll have at five-digit HP as a baseline, hit just as hard as your Servants, charge their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> by themselves, and may have a few extra boss skills on top of that to fit their lore. Many of them require a coordinated team of six powerful Servants to deal with. When they join you as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a>, they function like any other Servant, tend to have around a tenth the HP, and are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled">Overrated and Underleveled</a>. When you summon them to add them to your team permanently, they join at level 1 and require a metric ton of investment just to bring them up to par with their guest-star selves. This is somewhat justified, though: the protagonist of the game is a very weak Master, and when they switch sides, the Servants tend to now be running off your pitiful mana reserves instead of whatever was fueling them before.

<ul><li> When Cecil converts from a Dark Knight to a Paladin, he has to fight Dark Knight Cecil as a Paladin. The Dark Knight Cecil uses Dark Wave every turn, but that attack was removed from the Easytype version (which was also the version that was released as <em>Final Fantasy II</em> on the Super Nintendo in the US), leading players of those versions to wonder why Dark Knights could shoot energy beams all of a sudden. Cecil also goes down to Level 1 as a Paladin, but starts with around 600 HP and quickly gains levels and statistic points; a level 1 Paladin Cecil is nearly, if not as good as a level 20 Dark Knight Cecil.
</li><li> When he's evil, Golbez takes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Meteor</a> to the face and shrugs it off, can almost one-shot Cecil's entire party, and manages to regenerate his entire body from just a <em>hand</em>. After his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, he's left with just 2,943 HP.

</li></ul></li><li> An extremely egregious example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>: when you fight the summon Carbuncle, he is a huge gorilla-like beast with terrible fangs, deadly attacks and a vicious temper. You beat him, gain the power to summon him, and when you're ready to use him to thrash over your enemies... you discover that he's turned into a tiny green mouthless squirrel thing that can only cast support magic. And he will continue like that for the rest of the series.
</li><li> Umaro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> is a mild case, as in his enemy form as the Yeti he has 17,200 HP and significantly higher stats than he has upon recruitment (though he still has the highest HP, Strength and Defense of any character in the game).
</li><li> Yuffie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> has several unique and powerful attacks when you first encounter her, but upon joining your party she loses those abilities and becomes a normal character.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, Edea the Evil Uber-Hot Gothy Witch Queen is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first act — and turns into a rather weak playable character thereafter (additionally no longer ruling the world). The reason she becomes good in the first place is that she loses all her sorceress powers which made her powerful (and brainwashed) to Rinoa, thus making her a normal human being. When Squall tries to physically stop the brainwashed Rinoa from leaving the lunar base, he gets launched into the nearest wall. However, when you get Rinoa back, she isn't one bit more powerful than before (except for having a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>).
</li><li> Slight example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> Beatrix, who proves to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">more than a match for your party as you battle her time and time again</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> has Seymour to a degree; a while after you see him shredding all of those fiends with Anima, he'll join your party for a single bossfight. While very powerful, more so than your characters will be at this stage, he can't summon Anima and isn't nearly as powerful as when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you fight him for the first time not too long afterwards. So he loses power when joining the good guys, it just happens he does this before being revealed as a bad guy</span>.
<ul><li> Anima itself inverts this trope. It appears as a boss and is not particularly hard. When obtained for the player to summon, admittedly much later, it's much more powerful with its Overdrive dealing over 100 times the damage it did as an enemy.

However, other than gaining passive abilities when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a>, he doesn't pull anything you haven't seen before.

His health and strength levels are significantly lower when he's helping you than they were during the two boss fights when he fought against you earlier in the game. Justified, though, as the second boss fight against him happens only a few minutes earlier. So when he comes to your aid, he's still weakened from the beating he just received by your hand.
</li><li> The Espers, particularly the optional ones that the player does not automatically receive during the main storyline, who are among some of the toughest boss fights in the game.

When you get her back, she reverts back to the level she was before she left you, goes back to the job you were raising her as, and all the items she had in the battle are not kept.

In an unintentional subversion, the player can use a glitch to steal Vaida's Spear, the item that was coded to increase all of her stats (dubbed the "uber spear" by fangroups), and give it back to her in the next mission (or maybe even someone else, like a General or Paladin) allowing her to retain her beastly stats even while good.

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>, she <em>single handedly destroys a fleet of airships using one move</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> V</em> an infernal general Agrael in the end of his campaign decides that he had enough of his demonic masters, bails and switches to being a Warlock (well, the best he could get in his condition and he turns out quite a nice guy for a Dark Elf). Naturally, he loses all his abilities, even not demon-related, and levels of experience in the process and has to start evolving from scratch. Explained in-story as the effect of the ritual that purified him of demon taint. The same happens earlier, at the start of his own campaign: formerly a formidable hero in Isabel's campaign, he is suddenly brought down to level 1, and there's no story justification here.

Upon joining the heroes' team, Shade loses a ton of hit points, can no longer cast the Dark 2 spell, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualWielding">drops one sword</a>, causing Jay to gripe. Shade can eventually get the spell and second weapon back, but those boss-level HP are gone for good.

</li><li> The same can be said about Roxas, as when he is fought as an enemy in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">No Export for You</a> version, he's far more powerful than when you played as him.

(This goes both ways though as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Terra has some nifty darkness based powers LS doesn't have in <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em></span>.)

</li><li> Aqua in <em>III</em>, while possessed, nearly kills Riku and gives a boss fight to Sora. When she gets un-possessed, her biggest showing afterward is getting taken down by Vanitas in a rather anticlimactic manner.

She was already a competent soldier when two of the main characters were just little children. And then she joins your party... Part of this is handwaved with the explanation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was using the last strength of Entalar's barrier to empower herself for her boss fight</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfSpyro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfSpyro">The Legend of Spyro</a>: A New Beginning</em>. The villain for almost the entire game, Cynder, is actually a baby dragon, mutated into a powerful adult-like form by the powers of the actual main villain. Once she is defeated, she is cut off from these powers and reverts to her natural younger-looking, weaker, and much less badass form. She remains in this form throughout the ending and subsequent Spyro games, where she is a protagonist.
</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuminousArc">Luminous Arc</a></em>. Boss characters are simply a few levels higher and better equipped than you, but keep their stats, and equipment (which is generally on par with yours by the time they join). However any character who could summon monsters won't be able to do so when they switch sides.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar: Eternal Blue</a></em> has this with Leo... but averts it in that Leo appears to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> at the same rate as the protagonist, and when they duel one on one, Leo only has about 288 HP... around the same as he did when they teamed up. But the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> version undoes this by giving Leo about 750 HP for the duel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lunarosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Lunarosse">Lunarosse</a></em> zig-zags this trope a little. Elijah and Milo are actually stronger when they join up, but that's to keep them up to date as they join much later than their boss fight. Sonia, the Tierkreis, Abel and Marina play it straight, having noticeably less HP when they join. A justified example is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Noel, who only fights the party when possessed by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a>, who wouldn't hold back against the good guys</span>.
</li><li> Every secret character you can get in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em> is high or very high level (with the exception of Asagi, who is only level 50) when you have to fight them, but drop to level 1 and lose their stuff when they join you. Makes sense for several of the Overlords (as you're actually gaining a "phantom copy" of them), but not for Laharl and company, who join as themselves. Even the Robosuit reverts to level 1 after you claim it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</a></em>, this happens in the middle of the game. Bowser, who you had previously been controlling, fights the Mario Bros as a boss. He has increased HP, increased Attack, and the ability to target both brothers with a move which normally targets one opponent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Zero from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> games is at his most powerful when he's fighting against the player: he even has access to moves that the playable Zero is never able to use. In <em>X2</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was rebuilt with the ability to charge his saber and both busters</span>. He remains this powerful throughout <em>X3</em>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"loses" power in X4 in exchange for not, y'know, needing to charge his guns up every time he wants to fire</span>. In <em>X5</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zero is empowered by the Maverick Virus, as he is the original carrier of the virus and designed to be at his most powerful under its influence</span>.

It is GLORIOUS.
</li><li> Seen also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManPoweredUp">Mega Man Powered Up</a></em>, if playing as one of the other robots. In the place of the robot master you're playing as, you'll fight against an evil Mega Man wearing a purple scarf. He can charge his buster, Slide, and is quite the pain in the ass.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManUnlimited">Mega Man Unlimited</a></em> has this very noticeably with the final boss, the Z-Prototype. When you fight him as Mega Man, it's as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> where none of your attacks do any damage and you can basically do nothing except let him gradually whittle your HP down to 1. Later updates added an extra mode where you can play as this character, and not only is he not invincible, he actually loses HP every time he misses an attack!
</li></ul></li><li> Sam in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> when he's first encountered, and in his second fight he zooms around the battlefield dishing out quick strikes and powerful combos while taking all Raiden's attacks without flinching. When he's playable in the <em>Jetstream Sam</em> DLC he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a>, capable of amazing feats but without any access to the moves you can be on the receiving end of, with vastly reduced health.
</li><li> In <em>Monster Girl Quest: Paradox</em>, enemies you recruit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealthDamageAsymmetry">lose most of their HP, but their attacks also become much more powerful</a>, and their skills (and sometimes resistances) change somewhat. However, this trope only really applies to those bosses who are recruited immediately after you defeat them. Regular enemies and bosses with delayed recruitment are generally just as strong in your party as when you fought them. The trope is outright inverted in the case of Lucretia, who can only be recruited a very long time after she's fought, and is therefore far more powerful than she was as a boss.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>: by the point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ammon Jerro</span> joins you, he has just been stripped of his incredible power as a result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shandra</span> freeing the bound demons that powered him. Still somewhat in play due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>; he's supposed to be a powerful wizard with some bonuses thanks to his demonic pacts, but when you control him he's a pure Warlock (a <em>much</em> weaker class in this game) and a poorly built one at that.
</li><li> Sturm from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Nintendo Wars</a></em> game <em>Advance Wars</em> is an unlockable CO upon completion of the campaign. In the campaign, his units have 120% attack and 90% defense, while his CO power is to call a meteor down from the sky, doing up to 8 or 9 damage to all enemy units in the blast radius. The dev team (perhaps understandably) found this grossly overpowered, so in multiplayer, his units have 90% atk/120% def, and the damage from his meteor power is cut in half. Averted in <em>Advance Wars 2</em> though where Sturm becomes even more powerful, and isn't nerfed at all in multiplayer. If you choose his character, your friends will hate you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NocturneRebirth">Nocturne: Rebirth</a></em> has a downplayed example in Ristill, who never pulled a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. She forms an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> with the party in the final boss battle, but her stats are now similar to theirs' and nowhere near as high as when she was a boss. This is justified because the final boss weakened and nearly killed her in a previous cutscene.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Perspective flipped</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII">Overlord II</a></em> with Queen Fay. In her appearances as a hero she possesses magical powers such as teleportation, but shows no magic whatsoever after becoming your mistress following her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that turning evil was a side effect of you draining her powers to recharge your Tower Heart, and the Tower Heart has also consumed every drop of magic in the entire Sanctuary, so that by the time Fay is converted she's <em>literally</em> out of juice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, Personas are created out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">Shadows</a> when the person in question accepts their "true self". While the transformation makes the spiritual entity loyal and controllable, it also decreases their stamina at least a hundredfold, eliminates all their cool attacks, reduces them in physical size, <em>and</em> decreases their attack power. This is justified by Teddie's explanation that a strong-willed Shadow draws others to it to form a big mass of Shadows, and they make up the form you fight in the boss battle. So you're really fighting several Shadows combined in the boss battle, whereas when the character gets his Persona, it's only made up of a single Shadow.
<ul><li> Golden changes this around thanks the new abilities and new chances to give abilities to party members, making them skillwise, eventually as powerful as their shadows (Yukiko gains a variation of the exclusive fire attack her shadow had, Rise can shield all party members from damage for a turn like her shadow could, Naoto gets Heat Riser, and 3rd level element skills like their shadow etc) Their HP is still much lower, but it's a significant improvement.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goro Akechi</span> is far more powerful as a two-stage boss fight than they are as a playable character. Justified since they were deliberately holding back their true strength since using it would conflict with their story that they only recently got their Persona.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> has Fall-From-Grace, a succubus cleric who joins your party as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a>. She retains the elemental resistances of the tanar'ri, but she lacks the immunity to non-magical weapons and innate spellcasting ability that succubi normally have in 2nd edition D&amp;D. No in-game explanation for why she lacks these abilities is ever given.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeon">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pretty much every legendary you can recruit. By hacking the data it is possible to see that you actually get a copy of the recruitable boss upon defeating it. The boss version has higher stats in all areas, but most notably HP. They have 500 to 900% more HP than the playable copy you get.
</li><li> The most egregious example in the first pair of games is Rayquaza: the climax hinges on Rayquaza having a Hyper Beam attack strong enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>destroy an incoming meteorite big enough to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">destroy the Poképlanet</a></em></span>, but doesn't know Hyper Beam yet when you recruit it.
</li><li> Common recruitable Pokémon also suffer this: as enemies they have 300 to 600 IQ points, but once recruited they lose all the IQ points and all the IQ skills learned.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">[PROTOTYPE]</a></em>, the military generally acts as stupid as possible until you show up on the scene, at which point they'll call in heavily-armed air support. This is notable since, unlike you, the infected have no effective air support; you can easily destroy every single Hive in the <em>entire city</em> in less than ten minutes using a single helicopter, but apparently Blackwatch is saving them just for you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest">Puzzle Quest</a>: Challenge Of The Warlords</em>, you'll often find that after capturing an opponent, the uber-spell you were hoping to learn from it isn't available. (for instance, you can't learn Deathsting from the Giant Wasp or Breathe Ice from the Frost Dragon). Also, since the mana costs of learned spells are 50% higher than from "natural" use, often you won't have enough of a certain level to use it, even with full mana levels (Ex: You need 30 Blue Mana to use the Call The Horde spell, but Orc Lords only need 20) or the cost per attack isn't worth it (Rend is deadly in the hands of a Wyvern, not so much in yours).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RakenzarnTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RakenzarnTales">Rakenzarn Tales</a></em> plays it pretty straight. Even in friendly fights, your party members will be packing five-digit HP they didn't have five seconds before. One of Alleyne's training fights at least attempts to handwave it by saying she used forest magic to help out Kanon and Nowa for their fight against Kyuu.
</li><li> Two examples feature in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForceII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForceII">Shining Force II</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jaro the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pegasus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pegasus">Pegasus</a> Knight is initially met on the side of the devils (with his named shortened to 'Jar' for some reason) and joins the Force mid-battle because he's tired of working for the devils. As is typical for this trope, he's stronger as an enemy unit than he is an ally, though due to his starting position it's entirely possible he will defect before any of the Force's soldiers even have a chance to engage him.
</li><li> The last soldier recruited to the Force is Lemon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero">Tragic Hero</a> who was brainwashed into becoming the murderous Red Baron. Indeed, you have face him as the Red Baron, and unlike Jaro he's not just a regular enemy but is in fact a pretty tough boss. Once you beat him, he snaps out of the brainwashing and runs off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">trying to kill himself</a> before discovering he can't and joining the force. While not as strong as the Red Baron, he does avert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a> by having the ability to resurrect himself whenever he dies in battle.
</li></ul></li><li> This is all too common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a></em>. Fuseable demons that are faced as enemies tend to be stronger and/or have skills their playable versions lack, moreso if the demon is a boss.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skylanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Skylanders">Skylanders Trap Team</a>, this trope applies to most of the bosses. While, as bosses, they have a large health bar. When they are playable characters, their health bar recharges when not in use. However, said health bar is usually much smaller in health and takes damage over time. There are a few exceptions to this trope .
<ul><li> First is Sheep Creep, who, despite having the same health bar as the rest, is actually an improvement over his villainous Tutorial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroEffortBoss">Zero-Effort Boss</a> fight that can be defeated in one hit with the right attack.
</li><li> Next is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">The Gulper</a>, who, being a huge behemoth in the confrontation, then normal skylander sized as a playable character, would seem to be a perfect example of this trope if not for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneVictory">the fact that he can't win the fight due to not attacking.</a> His playable version actually has a moveset.
</li><li> Inverted with Broccoli Guy, Rage Mage, and Masker Mind. Like the Gulper, these Bosses have no way of attacking, but they all come with enemies to attack you and get enhanced. Hoowever, the bosses actually gain an attack when you play as them.
</li><li> Finally this trope is actually subverted with the final boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaos,</span> despite the fact that he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> who is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> with three phases, healing between each of them and shredding through skylanders like wet tissue paper. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaos</span>, when redeemed, has very powerful attacks, but nothing near the level of his boss counterpart. Not only that, but he still has the disadvantages of most trappable villains. How does this trope not apply? Well, he has an elemental circle attack, that summons a circle of elemental magic with effects dependant on the element. Then, you realize the magic element allows you to heal yourself up to full. Therefore, with propper use of it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">you literally can be immortal, having basically infinite HP</a>

When she joins you at end game, she has... 2500 HP. Which wouldn't seem too bad, except you and your enemies will probably be doing about 1500 damage per hit, not counting special attacks, making her an ultra-brittle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>.

Since you're playing as the bad guys here, this technically means you are the one being "un-redeemed" rather than your former friends. In any case, someone who was previously on your team is now your enemy, and Fenix in particular has much stronger stats than when you controlled him.

<ul><li> One of the more extreme examples is in <em>Original Generation 2</em>, where a boss character who pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> goes from having 100,000 HP to 5,500 - <em>in the middle of a battle</em>.
</li><li> Subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsReversal">Super Robot Wars Reversal</a></em> (SRWR). After fighting the rival robot of Gear Fighter Dendou, Gear Fighter Ogre, you can get it and it's stats will go down. But if during a route split you choose to fight the possessed Subaru who is using Ogre, after the battle you get him back and find out that the bad guys put Ogre back to the stats it had before, and you get to keep them this time. Also includes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>: if you're able to rescue Master Asia and revive him with Shin Getter Robo, they rebuild Master Gundam for him to use, though Rain points out that it isn't as strong as his original Master Gundam (which was not only DG Cell-powered, but also a boss unit in other games.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment">Super Robot Wars J</a></em> with Johnny and Yuu's sister from Brainpowerd, who's Barons are more powerful than all but Nelly Brain, but are nowhere near the 60k they exhibited as bosses.
</li><li> Played straight in the inverse in <em>Super Robot Wars Original Generation</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ingram</span> pulls his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and steals the R-Gun to boot. The machine's stats are <em>way</em> higher than they were five seconds ago when <em>you</em> were using it.
</li><li> Played depressingly straight in the true final stage <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsW">Super Robot Wars W</a></em>. After Critic deposes Inference and takes control of the Sapientia, Applicant shows up in the Val Arm to give you a hand. Naturally, the machine is many times worse in every respect than it was as the final boss of the previous stage, and Applicant himself is demoted as well, with lowered stats, fewer abilities, and missing his Double Move skill as well as his face cut-in. Also, he gains Main Character status and is not allowed to die. Oi.
</li><li> Folka in OG Gaiden plays around with this. As a boss he has well over 100,000 HP taking very long to kill but only has two relatively weak basic attacks so he's no real threat to your guys. Upon joining you his HP drops to the PC average of 6,000 but he also unlocks his incredibly powerful Fist of the North star type attacks (which he seemingly could always use but just didn't feel like it as a bad guy) causing him to do insane amounts of damage.
</li><li> While still ridiculously powerful in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV">Super Robot Wars V</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinMazingerZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShinMazingerZero">Mazinger ZERO</a> loses its regeneration ability after it joins.
</li><li> It's even more notable with Roze, Anew, and Kagura who don't even get to keep their units in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z</a></em> series. Roze and Anew are demoted to subpilots, and while for Anew this isn't that big a deal, Roze has higher stats than the main pilot of the Cosmo Crusher AND like Takeru has the ESP ability but is nonetheless forced to be Kenji's SP tank instead. Kagura at least gets to pilot, but he's a melee character as his brutal attacks as an enemy show, and despite having two different powerful melee centric units as an enemy, as a PC he's forced into the Aquarion Gepard, which has only ranged attacks, making his stats totally wasted. Averted with Jin, who like Kagura loses his Abductor unit in favor of Gepard, because his stats suit it anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny">Tales of Destiny</a></em> pits you against Leon Magnus, a genius swordsman who is tasked with kicking the snot out of the hero and his party. Given that this happens within the first few hours of the game, the party isn't even near the level needed to wear down his 9999 health points and survive his attacks. However, once he joins you, his level and stats are barely any higher than those of your other characters. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And of course, when he turns against the party halfway through the game, he suddenly gets a whopping five digit health and access to moves that the party member version didn't</span>. The Remake gives this more of a realism by reducing the boss version's HP and statistics to around what they should be when he joins the party, and instead just made him literally unbeatable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kratos, Sheena and Regal</span>, with the former happening in reverse order. What makes it strange is that he's fought both in a normal and solo fight, and when fought solo, Lloyd tells him not to hold anything back, but he not only has only 1/4 the HP he has in the normal boss fights, but appears to have taken considerably more damage when the fight is over.
</li><li> Potentially worse is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zelos; if you choose the Kratos path, you end up in a boss fight against Zelos</span>. Despite that he was in your party <em>two minutes ago</em>, he's suddenly got five-digit HP and tons of kickass moves. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwave</a> is attempted by the fact that he's now using angel powers, which he doesn't do with the party, but it's still jarring.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sheena</span> loses the ability to use the various guardian summons that made her boss battles so difficult. It's implied in one cutscene that she had a very limited number of those guardians, and has used them all up by the time she joins the party permanently.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Flynn</span> is an odd example — although he's not evil in the slightest. In the one instance when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">joins you in combat</a>, he has somewhere around 5000 HP and a paltry amount of Artes. Approximately <em>one day later</em> in the game's timeline, he and Yuri <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelBoss">duke it out</a> — and he's suddenly gained <em>six-digit HP</em> and a repertoire of deadly Artes, including Holy Lance and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Mystic Arte</a>, Radiant Dragon Fang. He must've done a <em>buttload</em> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> in that one day.
</li><li> Captain Schwann exemplifies both this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Evil Is Cool</a>. As a boss, he's incredibly difficult (although most of the difficulty comes from the fact that both your healers are absent from the party), has six-digit health, and extremely powerful techniques. He's missing most of those techniques and is back down to four-digit health when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he rejoins the party not much later as Raven</span>. Justified in that he's using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his blastia heart</span>) during the battle, <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">wielding his sword in the other hand</a>.
</li><li> In the PS3 remake the final team arena battle pits you against the party members you don't currently have with you. Not only do they have boss class hp and stats now, but they break the party size limit to attack you with ALL unused members making the match 4 against 5. The party seemingly puts more effort in friendly arena match than against the guys that want to destroy the world.

Both used to have five-digit HP or more, but are now reduced to 9.999 HP at most.

</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> game, in which player characters only have access to a small number of their available <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletHell">Spell Cards</a>, which are also drastically reduced in both power and duration compared to when they were antagonists. The regular games are more a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRulesAreNotYourRules">mechanic asymmetry</a>; the "boss version's" hit points are traded for mobility and evasion, and the variety of spell cards are replaced by supercharged regular attacks and a couple of equally upgraded cards (you can theoretically dodge any boss's attack or spell card; they generally can't avoid any of yours). The fighting games, however, play this trope straight for any character you have to unlock, as most of the challenge in the single-player story mode is learning how to dodge and shut down the various unlimited-duration, amped-up spell cards the AI characters invoke and spam between bouts of regular fighting.

On the good path, you can recruit someone in a boss mech with an absurd amount of hp (20000, when the others have like 5000) and strong attacks, and in the next fight she will be at full strength. Although she'll have trouble hitting the fast final boss, she will take a ridiculous amount of attacks and OHKO the minions.

It doesn't matter what victories they had a heroes, as revenants they cannot win a single fight, even against characters they were established as being stronger than while alive.

However, looking back at his earlier appearances shows that when he isn't using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">Chaos Corruption</a>, he has about the same level of power as his (Heroic) brothers, and may actually be slightly weaker (Understandable, given that he's the youngest of the three). It's just hard to notice due to the fact that he has precisely one fight scene where he <em>doesn't</em> use Chaos Corruption, and there's enough of a power gap between him and his opponents that he seems super strong by comparison.

Despite having three more years to practice with his powers, Bennett still loses miserably to the new Clayface; Basil Karlo, who just got his power a few days ago. To be fair though, this had more to do with Karlo intentionally mutating himself by taking an <em>ass-load</em> more of the clay that created them both than Bennett did. Also, unlike Bennett, Karlo didn't have to worry about losing control because he didn't care.
</li><li> Ben 10's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> Kevin 11 undergoes this following his between-series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em>. In the original series, he was a deadly enemy with the powers of Ben's 10 original aliens plus his own energy absorption powers (which he'd once used on the Omnitrix.) After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, he is inexplicably not evil anymore, and his powers have just as inexplicably changed: he now absorbs matter, turning into any material he touches, Absorbing Man-lite. In this form, he suffers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> to the point that we'd be calling it The Kevin Effect if the series had come along earlier. Waaaay later, we get the explanation: he can do matter and energy, but absorbing energy warps his mind. He has to stick to matter or he'll go evil again.
</li><li> When opposing them, Amazo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> was the most powerful being ever introduced who could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">brush off every superhero in existence with minimal effort</a>. When he fought against Solomon Grundy on the JL's side with the intention of simply erasing him from existence, his attack only served to empower Grundy. Realizing this, Amazo backed off and retreated several light-years to come up with a new strategy. He was still thinking about what to do when the episode ended and was never seen again.

Before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, he was a bad ass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shapeshifting">shapeshifter</a>.

As a virus, she is the queen of chaos. As a sprite, she can't even fly.

</li><li> Tohru in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em>. In Season 1, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">The Brute</a> among the villains and very much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> who routinely tosses Jackie around like a ragdoll during fight scenes. In the Season 1 finale, he pulls an abrupt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a>.

In the first four TV specials, he is a ruthless maniac prone to cruelty and greed. In the series starts menacing but a little more moderate, more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge">The Scrooge</a> to eventually evolve into what was basically an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> and a regular ally of the raccoons when it matters.

Since than, she's fought Toffee, the Truth or Punishment Cube, and Meteora and lost every time. And that was when she had a fair amount of backup with her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers">The Angry Beavers</a></em>, Norbert was quite skilled as Baron Bad Beaver, the arch-nemesis of Muscular Beaver (Dagget's alter-ego). When he became Muscular Beaver's <em>sidekick</em>, he lost his cape and fearsome helmet and became more or less Norbert with a bucket for a helmet.
