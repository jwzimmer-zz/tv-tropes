</p><p>Traditionally, vampires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">had to kill others</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">maintain their own extended lifespan</a>, a supernatural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">Conservation of Energy</a> law.

Some vampires might be charismatic monsters now, but they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, and likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>. They weren't even human in the original folklore and mythology, being either demons or demons possessing human corpses.

Since readers were unlikely to have much sympathy for beings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHunger">who committed murder on a weekly basis</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">the necessity of killing had to go</a>, as well as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmBloodbagsAreEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmBloodbagsAreEverywhere">constant urge to chow down on co-stars.</a> In some fiction, vampirism is nothing more than a lifestyle choice; since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">these vampires</a> get extended life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">superhuman strength</a>, and still have great sex from just a few drops of blood each night, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">it's difficult to understand why anyone stays</a> human.
</p><p>Television and film have lagged behind books a bit, with nice vampires exceptional rather than common. The vampires in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrilogy">Blade Trilogy</a></em> would seem capable of living just on stored blood, but since they seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilistes</a>, they enjoy killing humans as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery">demonstration of superiority.</a>

There might be something to this, in that they're already part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>, and therefore better equipped to handle supernatural villains than the average detective.

Given the large number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antihero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Antihero">antiheroes</a> on this show, this is quite impressive. As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantMonster">Reluctant Monster</a>, she refuses to drink blood; when she finally gives in and sucks her crush's blood <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in response to his dying wish</span>, she is recognized by the other characters as being a true monster. She retains her perky and somewhat subservient disposition, despite impressive battle-lust. Additionally, in the anime series, she assumes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireDetective">Vampire Detective</a> role on several occasions.
</li><li> Her Master, Alucard, <em>functions</em> as a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire, but only because Integra's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidWithTheLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidWithTheLeash">got him on a leash</a>. He certainly has more moral standards than and openly opposes Millennium's vampires, anyway. Just don't get on his bad side or insult Integra. There's a reason Alucard has hundreds of thousands of dead souls at his disposal.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Master of Mosquiton</em>: In both his television and OVA depictions, the eponymous vampire is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">Dogged Nice Guy</a> who's at Inohue's beck and call... until he drinks blood, that is.

They're still nice people and ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. The heroine and her servant match the trope perfectly, or would if they weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">even further from traditional vampires</a> than the Schiff.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin">Karin</a></em> has an entire <em>family</em> of Friendly Neighborhood Vampires, the most obvious example of which is the <a class="urllink" href="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/karin_cute_friendly_vampire.jpg">title character<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. They're so friendly, in fact, that being bitten by one is actually <strong>good</strong> for your health! Specifically, each vampire has a preferred affinity that draws their attention. When they suck blood, they suck this preferred affinity out temporarily. This is good for everyone when the trait is bad — for example, Karin's brother is attracted to <em>stress</em>, his "victims" are drained of all their tension and left relaxed and happy (he targets stressed out women because afterwards, they tend to be... <em>appreciative</em>); most of Karin's family has negative affinity (her mother's affinity is deceit, her father's is pride). This is bad when the trait is good. For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Karin's grandmother Elda is attracted to <strong>love</strong>, her victims are drained of any feelings of love and caring, becoming hateful wretches, including her lover Alfred</span>.
<ul><li> Karin herself is an inverted "blood-maker" vampire, who rather than needing bloods produces too <em>much</em>, and once a month has to get rid of it by biting a human and injecting the excess blood. At the same time, she has an affinity of her own: <em>unhappiness</em>. So the "victim" winds up being both cheerful and energetic for the next month.
</li></ul></li><li> Pachira from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalPokaan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalPokaan">Magical Pokaan</a></em>, who's really just looking for a boyfriend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACupAngst">a larger bust</a>. She wants the boyfriend to let her bite him, but only with the best of intentions. Otherwise, her vampirism only shows up when it's plot-important. Pachira manages to subsist on tomato juice, and, in fact, donated blood when she sees a cute guy working at the blood donation clinic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>:
<ul><li> Moka Akashiya is not just friendly, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend">head-over-heels in love</a> with the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High-School Student</a>. Also, she usually drinks canned tomato juice rather than blood (except if it's Tsukune's blood, which she sucks a bit every morning). Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> is less friendly... but honestly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">not by as much as you'd think.</a>
</li><li> Her younger sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Kokoa Shuzen</a> is rather less than friendly, being quite inclined to bash in the head of anyone who annoys her (which isn't difficult to do) with a giant mace (or whatever her pet bat can turn into). Her older sister Kahlua Shuzen is a mixed bag; she's downright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, yet friendly at the same time. "Insane" isn't anywhere near sufficient to describe how messed up Kahlua is. Akua, while clearly having a dark intent going, cares a lot about her stepsister Moka.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TanyaHuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TanyaHuff">Tanya Huff</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodBooks">Blood Books</a></em> series has vampires who are pretty much just like they were in life, only now they live forever and drink blood. The main vampire character in the series is a romance novelist, for heaven's sake.
</li><li> Vampires in Marianne Mancusi's <em>Blood Coven</em> series fit this. They <em>do</em> feed from humans, but the humans in question are voluntary participants, are not killed, and are well-paid for their trouble. (They're also carefully screened before being chosen, as these vampires are still susceptible to blood-borne pathogens.) Furthermore, any turnings are done with the knowledge and consent of the one turned. (There <em>was</em> an involuntary turning once, but it was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenIdentity">Mistaken Identity</a>: The protagonist was meant to be turned, but her identical twin sister ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The vampire responsible promptly apologized for the mistake and dropped everything to help cure her.)
</li><li> Jody from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherMoore">Christopher Moore</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodsuckingFiends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BloodsuckingFiends">Bloodsucking Fiends</a></em> and its sequel <em>You Suck</em>. She turns her boyfriend Tommy into a vampire at the end of the first book, and he spends most of the second book trying to cope with it. Vampires in this setting have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">Super Senses</a> to the point of being able to detect people with terminal diseases, so if they want to avoid hurting people it's easy for them to avoid people who have long, full lives ahead of them. Coping with the change is hard for Jody and Tommy, but that's just because of the "bursting into flames in sunlight" thing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bunnicula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bunnicula">Bunnicula</a> ruthlessly drinks the life juices from its victims, which he requires to live (he's greatly weakened when Chester the cat uses garlic to prevent him from attacking anyone). Subversion? Heck, no. Bunnicula is a vampire <em>rabbit</em>, and sucks the juice out of <em>vegetables</em>. Toward the human members of the family and other pets, he's quiet and nonviolent, Chester's paranoia notwithstanding.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChelseaQuinnYarbro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChelseaQuinnYarbro">Chelsea Quinn Yarbro</a>'s Count Saint-Germain is an early example of this trope in modern literature. He takes blood from willing or sleeping victims, with care not to take so much that they might become vampires themselves (unless they agree to this). Honorable, and not prone to violence unless he or those under his protection are attacked. Madeleine and Olivia, two other vampires who are book protagonists, also qualify.
</li><li> Andre from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DianaTregarde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DianaTregarde">Diana Tregarde</a> novels is decidedly this trope. When good witch Diana first encounters him, she thrusts a crucifix in his face. His response is to look at her sadly, take the cross from her hand and kiss it reverently. He and Diana become allies and lovers as the story progresses.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> has the Black Ribbon Society, a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">vampires who sign a pledge not to drink human blood and who hold regular meetings for mutual reinforcement</a>. Some vampires continue to drink some blood, but only from uncooked meat or other "stand-ins"; however, in order to prevent themselves from relapsing, the Black Ribboners must often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictionDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictionDisplacement">focus single-mindedly on some other hobby or activity</a>.

The Magpyr Family don't go on rampages of terror or paint the town red. They are (with one minor exception) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">polite and civilised</a>, with only the slight drawback of overusing their mental powers to take over places (but still doing it peacefully...ish). They also set up communities where villages "willingly" donate blood to Vampires whenever they want it. Subverted with the character of the Old Count Magpyr, who was very much of the old school of vampiring; living in an ominous mountainside castle (named Dontgonearthe Castle) and so forth. This was actually a clever move in the long run because the Count realised that the fastest way to avoid being killed permanently was by giving people a fighting chance in order to level the playing field. This takes the form of deliberately leaving holy water in his own castle, having lots of ornaments which can be bent into religious symbols and big wide windows for letting the sunshine in. This method worked much better, so much so that the Old Count was actually respected and liked by the locals despite technically being a stereotypical monster vampire.
<ul><li> He was apparently given to telling his Igor, point blank and apparently unprovoked, that the day vampires won every time would be the day they truly died. Granny charges him to "teach [the Magpyr children] to be stupid," but he sounds like a pretty smart guy to me.
</li><li> The Old Count also acknowledged the villagers as people, even considering some of his past "killers" to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponents</a>, as opposed to the current generation who wanted to treat them like cattle.

Rather than drain people through sex, which would be typical of his kind but is dangerous and addictive to the victims, he at one point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ran a hair salon, getting his sustenance a little at a time while handling women's heads and talking with them</span>.

He makes Harry run a race with him down a beach, kicking sand into his face, and the race eventually makes Harry gasping, tired, and incredibly thirsty for water. Harry takes a single gulp of water from his bottle, knowing that one gulp won't be enough, and then Thomas knocks it out of his hand before he can take another sip. <em>That</em> is how it feels, he explains, to limit yourself to what you can feed on as a vampire.
</li><li> He is however pretty much a huge exception to the rule as the Black Court are straight up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, the Red Court are likewise horrific monsters that put on a veneer of civilization, and only the White Court has even the option of being anything other than monstrous.

</li><li> In <em>Freshman</em>, Tabitha is a vampire, and it basically is a lifestyle choice. Apparently, a hundred years ago, it was the "in" thing to do, with such luminaries as the Rockefellers becoming vampires. (They hired doubles for photos). She considers biting people "too tacky for words" and uses a syringe instead.
</li><li> While it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord">never said outright</a>, Silas seems to fit this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGraveyardBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGraveyardBook">The Graveyard Book</a></em>. It's said several times that he belongs to neither the living nor the dead, and near the end of the book he confesses to having a monstrous past in which he did much worse things than the Jacks have done. In the present he's Bod's fierce protector.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Remus Lupin is a Friendly Neighborhood Werewolf, and even takes Wolfsbane potion to prevent his transformations from being accompanied by a murderous rampage. The condition is seen as an unfortunate incurable disease in Potterverse, so that despite his efforts, he is very much a social outcast. Rather than being immortal, he is expected to die young as a result. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And does, though not from that.</span>
</li><li> An actual vampire, Sanguini, does appear briefly in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>. Judging by his "agent" Eldred Worple's comments and the book he wrote, vampires are not necessarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a>, just secretive from wizards. However, centaurs and merpeople actually opted out of being classified as "beings", because they didn't want to be associated with creatures such as vampires and hags. And there is a moment when Sanguini starts eyeing a group of girls a little too hungrily and has to be called away by Worple. So, although he's not currently going on a murderous rampage, there's no guarantee he won't start one at any moment.
</li></ul></li><li> Vampires in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HereticalEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HereticalEdge">Heretical Edge</a></em> run the gauntlet, morally. There's absolute monsters, sure, but there's also Asenath, who is probably the most morally upright character thus far and spends her immortality helping anyone who needs it.
</li><li> Vampires in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows">The Hollows</a></em> come in two forms: living and undead. Living vampires are basically just humans with some of the vampire benefits and the craving for blood; most of them are friendly. Undead vampires lack a soul, a conscience and all forms of compassion: they most certainly <em>don't</em> qualify. For now. Based on the general trends of the series and the revelation that undead vampires feed to make a tentative, temporary connection to their missing souls, they're clearly being set up for more sympathetic characterization down the line. Whether this will ever affect their relationship to regular people is much less certain.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohannesCabalTheNecromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohannesCabalTheNecromancer">Johannes Cabal</a></em> as well as the later books, Cabal's brother Horst is a vampire and a really nice, charming guy-far more squeamish about killing someone than his human brother. In the fourth book, those who meet him think that he's actually kind of a rubbish vampire-until they make him mad and he decides to be a bit threatening.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KittyNorville">Kitty Norville</a> suggests that her various listeners aim for this on her Midnight Hour radio show. In practice, it's been a mixed bunch: Rick, Alette, and the Washington D.C. shapeshifters are nice, if slightly isolationist, folk who just happen to be afflicted with a common chronic disease and immortality. Kitty <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Ben</span> are pretty much the same way, although more aggressive in dealing with Unfriendly Neighborhood Vampires. The neighborhood part seems to be attached to the friendly one, as vampires or werewolves that don't have some normal civilized life to focus on end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles">The Laundry Files</a></em>: Subverted. Vampires in this universe cannot feed without killing. Vampirism in this universe is caused by a human mind merging with an extradimensional parasite that grants longevity and all the usual vampiric benefits, along with some heavy-duty magical abilities. It will also attempt to use the vampire's mind as a conduit to enter our universe, materializing inside the vampire's brain and causing holes in the brain reminiscent of what is seen in patients with "mad cow"-disease. The only way around this is for the vampire to take some blood from another human, effectively creating a magical link that will transfer the deleterious effects to someone else, who will inevitably die. A vampire keeping their activities to an absolute minimum might be able to feed as rarely as once a month, a vampire throwing around serious combat magic might need to feed every hour. This means that even relatively benevolent vampires like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mhari</span>, who feeds exclusively on the already dying, is still the kind of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePsychopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePsychopath">psychopathic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who is comfortable with killing twelve people a year if it means they can be immortal and powerful.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittleVampire">The Little Vampire</a></em>, a young, oft-bullied boy becomes friends with a vampire child named Rüdiger (Rudolph). The whole thing's rather adorable. The series has a dark twist in the seventh book, when Tony (the boy) reads a local newspaper and learns that seven people have recently died of "fatigue due to gradual blood loss". So Rudolph's family are still killers, even though they try to be a little subtle about it.
</li><li> Daetrin Haal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMadnessSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMadnessSeason">The Madness Season</a></em> fought the Tyr until the bitter end when Earth was first invaded by them.

Stefan is the closest thing there is to a non-evil vampire in the series. He doesn't kill the humans he feeds on, and treats them well. He's a very nice guy, and, among other things, has painted his bus to look like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Mystery Van</a> and is a fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>. Most importantly, he clearly cares about Mercy. However, his care for her and his flock does not extend to all humanity, and he does not hesitate to kill two innocent humans in order to protect Mercy.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth Adventures</a></em> series, most vampires (such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> team member Vic</span>) are harmless, keeping to their own dimension, feeding off the blood of livestock, and throwing <em>great</em> parties. This isn't the case everywhere, though — a different group of vampires enslaved the entire dimension of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kowtow</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NathanielKeene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NathanielKeene">Nathaniel Keene</a></em>, the titular character is a dorky, socially-awkward vampire with a fondness for insects. According to his friend, Dimitri:
<div class="indent"> "He's the nicest bloodsucking demon you'll ever meet!"
</div></li><li> Most of the vampires from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewAmsterdamBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NewAmsterdamBooks">New Amsterdam Books</a></em> fit this trope to one degree or another. While they do require human blood, they don't require all the blood of any individual human. Established vampires have "courts" so that they can spread the bloodletting among several humans; less established vampires visit underground clubs where (usually) willing humans offer their blood in exchange for cash or thrills. Vampires in general actually frown on murdering humans, although less from kindness than from a desire to avoid negative publicity.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress">Night Huntress</a></em> books, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">vampires do not need to kill their victims</a>, so they can be good or evil. Bones especially fits this trope, since he hunts down other vampires who murder, rape and use humans. Vampires in that world are a significant minority of the population (along with ghouls) that behave just like humans with special powers; either good or bad. In addition to Bones, Spade, Dave, Juan, Tate, Rodney, and Annette are all quite friendly for undead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Mencheres</a> isn't bad, if a bit cryptic sometimes.
</li><li> Vampires in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> books, despite being inherently Dark, generally strive to be good people. Anton's neighbours are a family of vampires, yet he had no idea they were anything other than decent human beings until after he was recruited by the Night Watch; after he gets over the initial shock, their relationship becomes strained, though they remain on good terms. Also, vampires invented blood transfusion technology so they'd have a way to feed without having to kill people; the fact that it saves human lives is just a fortunate side-effect. Unfortunately, they do have to suck blood straight from the neck on occasion, which can cause problems.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmeliaAtwaterRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmeliaAtwaterRhodes">Amelia Atwater-Rhodes</a>' <em>Nyeusigrube</em> has SingleEarth, a peaceful coalition of vampires, shapeshifters, witches, etc. Vampires in this group tend to feed only on animals or willing human donors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheParasolProtectorate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheParasolProtectorate">The Parasol Protectorate</a></em> takes place in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> version of Victorian England considered progressive for integrating vampires and werewolves into society, whereas other countries, especially Italy and America, have a... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">less accepting attitude</a>. Most werewolves serve in the military, while vampires are employed as political advisors, and while the vampires tend to have their own agendas, some (like Lord Akeldama) are more benign.
</li><li> Subverted in Daniel Gonzalezs <em>Ravencraft</em> with Lucilla. She is an agent of the Raven Corporation (thus a traitor vampire that helps hunting vampires) but is generally presented as selfish and psychopathic. She is the only good vampire in the book (werewolves on the other hand are equally divided among good and bad, like people).

At least he's a Surly Neighborhood Vampire— the rest of his 'family' fit this trope pretty well too, like Carlisle, vampire doctor and upstanding member of the community, and his wife and their 'kids'. This is one of the few things about Vampires she doesn't do too bad a job with. Aside from the Cullens, Vampires are shown to be evil. Even among the Cullens, some of them still struggle to varying degrees with the hunger. In fact, that struggle is a major plot point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnderAVelvetCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnderAVelvetCloak">Under a Velvet Cloak</a></em>, the vampire colony obtains small quantities of blood from local livestock about every week or two.

His loyalty is ultimately with the vampire race, though, rather than humanity and he tears into anyone who tries to hurt them. The concept is also played with as this is the image vampires want to project to the world even though it's a lie.
</li><li> In <em>The Vampirates</em>, despite being widely feared by humans, the Vampires are kind, treating their donors gently and seeing them as friends. Lorcan's affection for Grace is particularly sweet.
</li><li> Louis in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireChronicles">The Vampire Chronicles</a></em> tries to do this for several years, surviving on rats and chickens.

</li><li> Many of the vampires in P.N.Elrod's books are this way. There's PI Jack Fleming in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampireFiles">The Vampire Files</a></em> series (though he's a gruff, hard-boiled type) and Richard Dunn in the <em>Keeper of the King</em> trilogy. Another series focuses on a 'Gentleman' vampire.
</li><li> Samantha Moon of the <em>Vampire for Hire</em> series clings to her humanity, taking in most of her blood from butcher's shops and insisting on continuing to maintain a semblance of normality, dropping her kids off to school in the morning and picking them up afterwards.
</li><li> The main characters of the <em>Vampire Island</em> children's series by Adele Griffin are a family of fruit bat hybrids who don't drink blood at all.
</li><li> Alexander Sterling, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireKisses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireKisses">Vampire Kisses</a></em> is another vampire boyfriend, who has to protect his girlfriend from vampires of the not-so-friendly type.
</li><li> Originally, all vampires in the <em>Vampire Memories</em> series by Barb Hendee were this; their laws forbade them from ever killing to feed, and their telepathic abilities enabled them to alter their victims' memories so that they would not remember being fed upon by a vampire. Then a vampire got created who had no telepathy....Fearing that the other vampires would kill him for breaking their laws, he struck first and killed every vampire who knew of the laws or of telepathy, leaving only a handful of survivors, who proceeded to kill to feed for centuries. Cut to the present, where the story begins with one of the few surviving vampires, one of Julian's own progeny, in fact, rediscovering telepathy. Said vampiress, Eleisha, proceeds to become one of these, and to try to convince other vampires to become this as well. She has some success.

He's a higher vampire, and in his younger days he was a hellion among vampires, becoming thoroughly addicted to the intoxicating taste of blood. But after one exceedingly drunken night of blood-imbibing debauchery that ended with him getting a little bit dismembered and staked (turns out it takes way more than that to kill a true higher vampire), he sobered up once he finished regenerating, swore off blood, and because an herbalist and healer. He eventually joins Geralt's eclectic group on their quest to save Ciri, where his various vampiric powers, such as flight, invisibility, and immunity to fire made him an invaluable ally.

</li><li> Kicking off with a non-vampire example, Rev Bem of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Andromeda">Andromeda</a></em> is a member of a cannibalistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">world-swarming</a> race called the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Magog</a>. He is also something of a vegetarian, a peaceful preacher-type and a pacifist intellectual who has never been shown fighting and/or killing, except against his own kind in self-defense. And even then, he felt bad about it afterwards.
</li><li> Barnabas Collins from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DarkShadows">Dark Shadows</a></em>, one of the earliest (1966) sympathetic (though not actually <em>good</em>) vampires. He killed a lot of people in his initial appearance and was intended to be a temporary character, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">was kept on because he was so popular</a>, and turned into a tragic figure rather than an outright monster.

He "repaid humanity for his sins" in many roles since his becoming a vampire during the crusades, all the while seeking to become human again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">it didn't work.</a></span>
<ul><li> Various other vampires, such as Janette, Vachon, Erica, the angel, Screed, The Inca, Aristotle, Jody, Feliks, Serena and Urs also coexist well with the humans in the present day (or at least try to), although several of them happily partook in vicious killings in the past, making them literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredMonster">Retired Monsters</a>, and a good half of the vampires who appear on the show (even ones who were good people as humans) dont even manage to achieve that much.
</li></ul></li><li> Mick St.John of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Moonlight">Moonlight</a></em> also desired to make up for his vampirism through benevolence.
</li><li> The Count from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> is a very fine example of a friendly neighborhood vampire.

Even so, he didn't <em>hurt</em> Grover, but just hypnotized him to do his job with ridiculous speed and efficiency. Also, while staying over at Bert and Ernie's, he kept Ernie up all night with his counting sheep, resulting in a humorously traumatized Ernie. The Count's actual "vampirism" is more or less an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>. He has the stereotypical accent and title, those sure <em>look</em> like fangs, and a strange compulsion to count things is a vampiric trait in some legends, but it's not like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> actually ever <em>shows</em> him stalking the night to Suck the Felt of the Living.
</li><li> Grandpa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters">The Munsters</a></em> is as friendly as vampires get. Lily is pretty much the same.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>:
<ul><li> There was a group of friendly vampires back in season two. The Winchesters seem to have forgotten about them, and currently decapitate any vampire they find. The leader of the vampires, Lenore, returns in the episode "Mommy Dearest" and we find out what happened to her and her group. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Because <em>Supernatural</em> is the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>, all of them have gotten back to killing people, unable to resist it, and Castiel kills Lenore to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">put her out of her misery</a>.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Benny in season 8. After Dean gets him out of Purgatory, he makes a promise not to drink from living humans, instead living off blood bags taken from hospitals. He seems to be doing all right, even associating with humans regularly (under the guise of an ordinary human) and getting a job in a diner... at least until the midseason finale. He had been shown to have mild struggles with varying degrees of bloodlust around fresh wounds in previous episodes, despite always being able to keep it under control, although the end of "Citizen Fang" is ambiguous as to whether Benny actually snapped and killed Martin (although the circumstances are very suspicious).</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TalesFromTheCrypt">Tales from the Crypt</a></em> story "The Reluctant Vampire" involved a vampire who shied away from directly drinking blood from humans, rather getting it during his night watchman duty at a blood bank.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUK">Being Human</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series features not only a Friendly Neighborhood Vampire, but also a Friendly Neighborhood Werewolf (locking himself away during transformations) and a Friendly Neighborhood Ghost (who only scared people because she was confused about what happened to her).
</li><li> Mitchell is a dark deconstruction of the Friendly Neighbourhood Vampire. He honestly hates all the killing and doesn't want to hurt people, but it takes him three series to realise that the entire idea of the FNV is ludicrous: his addiction (blood isn't necessary for a vampire's survival in the <em>Being Human</em> universe: instead, it's a psychological addiction and Mitchell is trying to get clean) will never go away, he's constantly being tempted, and being immortal means that sooner or later he'll fall off the wagon again. By the end of series 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he knows the only solution is to die</span>.
</li><li> Hal from season four succeeds in this far more than Mitchell does. He goes to enormous lengths to do so, though, such as basing his entire existence around routine and order. With the help of his own Friendly Neighborhood werewolf and ghost, he's developed a system of life that (while driving him to become obsessive-compulsive to the extreme) does work. Whether this will last is unclear, but we can all hope, right?
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf">Teen Wolf</a></em>, Derek's pack counts as the werewolf equivalent. Scott, too.
</li><li> This is what Vlad from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungDracula">Young Dracula</a></em> wants his family to be. While they're never exactly friendly he does manage to stop them from killing their neighbors. There's a casual mention of them going through postmen extremely fast, but it's not clear whether they're actually dying, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the only human explicitly killed by them was Will, who they kept around as a vampire</span>.
</li><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em> is that the invention of artificial blood has allowed vampires to step into society to become these. The transition from being a race of blood-sucking killers to Friendly Neighborhood Vampires does have its difficulties, however, which provides most of the conflict for the show. Godric is probably the best example. He is genuinely nice to humans. He doesn't treat them as inferiors, unlike most vampires. In the present day, he only killed one human on screen, and it was in defense of a third party. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The human was trying to rape Sookie.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> episode "Bad Blood" has a vampiric clan travelling the country in an RV caravan and generally being lawful citizens (they even pay taxes, as one of them points out). The villain of the episode is actually the only one of them who has trouble keeping a low profile and their representative apologizes for his behavior before they disappear into the night, leaving Mulder and Scully drugged but otherwise unharmed.

Although a vampire, he is described to be caring, compassionate, kind and empathetic individual who much prefers saving and helping others then killing others. If Stefan harms or kills someone, he will feel extreme guilt and remorse for his actions. Several other vampires feed on blood from a blood bank, or feed on humans but only rarely and lightly from any individual in a deliberate attempt to avoid endangering them. Most vampires who do so do it out of prudence (leaving bodies lying around all over the place would endanger the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a>) rather than humanitarianism
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodEats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodEats">Good Eats</a></em>, a vampire named "Vlad" asks Alton to help him get over a fear of garlic, because he's finding that women these days want men who can cook and so many different dishes involve garlic in some capacity. Unfortunately for Vlad, Alton opens a window at the wrong time and ends up disintegrating him.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>:
<ul><li> Unsurprisingly, a number of players will play these, ranging from Red Cross employees (cut out the middleman; bitten humans are going to get transfusions anyway if properly diagnosed) to energetic geeks who play too much DDR ("Pale? Of course I'm pale. Ahh, curs'd daystar, bane of my existence!"). Some storytellers claim this is becoming almost as tired a cliche as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> ones or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">brooders</a>. Many others disagree, for few things are as giggle-worthy as a room of black-clad vampires playing Mario Kart and asking for one part blood, three parts Mountain Dew. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Requiem</a></em> carries on the tradition - it's easy to imagine a vampire who leaves her Carthian Movement meeting and hits the all-night arcade.
</li><li> It's also perfectly possible for vampires in both games (well, only the younger vampires in <em>Requiem</em> for the most part) to get their required sustenance by feeding on animals. While it's more humane, individual animals don't carry much, it doesn't taste quite as good, and you'll be looked at funny because the two dominant vampire religious bodies say that you're a divine predator meant to cull the human herd. In <em>Requiem</em>, it should be noted that as Blood Potency goes up, your diet becomes more restricted — animals quickly fall out as an option, and eventually <strong>humans</strong> do too. That said, the Ordo Dracul's Coils of the Dragon can eliminate this. Also, rules-wise you are not required to gain Blood Potency as you age, though it does give you certain advantages like being able to use more blood to power your powers, and Blood Potency can be dropped by entering torpor.
</li><li> However, you can end up doing horrible things during Frenzy whether you want to or not. Also, it's specifically mentioned that some vampires take it upon themselves to break others of excessive humanity, considering holding yourself to a high standard a naive impediment. Therefore in some ways <em>Masquerade</em> can still actually be more forgiving — although frenzy is still an issue, you can feed on anything no matter how powerful you are, and other vampires are less likely to attempt to sabotage and manipulate you into monstrous behavior for the hell of it. Doing it because it advances their own goals, on the other hand...
</li><li> The Tzimisce Clanbook has a template for a vampire who has appointed himself <em>Voivode</em> of a section of ghetto. Of course he demands obedience and respect, but as long as he gets it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">he fulfills the responsibilities of a lord</a> by providing protection and otherwise seeing to the well-being of his domain.

<ul><li> In <em>Warhammer</em>, vampirism doesn't <em>per se</em> make you evil, it just inflames your natural personality traits and cranks them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. A proud warrior becoming a vampire becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>, a greedy noble becoming a vampire becomes an insane hedonist, and theoretically a good person becoming a vampire would be a paragon.

They didn't listen and that is exactly what happened and in the first opportunity he got, he deserted his mistress to start his own order of vampire knights. Abhorash told his followers to not feed on innocent blood and instead seek out the strongest warriors to prey upon. While one could be led to believe they'd prey only on the perverse and wicked, their eating habit also includes brave and valiant heroes even though they don't deserve to die, all because they are physically powerful. So at really best, Abhorash is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> who avoids feeding on the innocent, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">heroic warriors are fair game</a>.

Unfortunately, over a decade or so he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowlySlippingIntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowlySlippingIntoEvil">grew dissatisfied</a> with what he perceived as a lack of sufficient gratitude on the townsfolk's part and began demanding greater and greater rewards for his efforts until they finally refused to pay anymore.

</li><li> Lord Lovidicus was actually like this, at first. He was very truly and deeply in love with his mistress (who did not realise he was a vampire), and when she became pregnant he loved and cared very much for their unborn son, but despite everything, she immediately turned on him when he told her he was a vampire. Her betrayal utterly enraged him and drove him to madness. The fact that he was trapped in his room for at least two decades and starved of blood after she locked him in didn't help any, and by the time the player character stumbled upon him, his mind was so far gone that he could only think to kill and feed. He swore he would hunt her down if he was freed, but she had already died by the time that actually happened.

They're otherwise fairly benign; Vance serves as something of a grief counsellor for a young man who murdered his parents to eat their flesh and was wracked with guilt, an example of how bad it can get if it were not for cult's pragmatic practices. Meanwhile, it is possible for the player to convince them to take regular blood donations from the people of Arefu in exchange for (A) otherwise leaving them alone or (B) offering an exchange of protection services for occasional donations, changing the Family's association with Arefu from parasitic to symbiotic, which actually makes them even more of an example of the Friendly Neighborhood Vampire trope.

Interestingly enough, life as a vampire is not much different that life as a human, as they never seem to drink blood, and have no aversion to sunlight. In fact, the only results of becoming a vampire for either of them appears to be a change of Hair Style and instantly learning kung fu, which makes you wonder why a cure was even developed in the first place. Louie was shown drinking blood from a transfusion pack in the Olympics arc, and also in one of those awful animated shorts.

<ul><li> Havenfall also has a whole family of Friendly Neighborhood Werewolves, the Hunts. Mackenzie Hunt is Havenfall's current sheriff and another potential love interest.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Nasuverse">Nasuverse</a> tends to go with more terrifying vampires, on the whole (and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">supremely weird</a> ones, at that), but there's a few examples of this trope across the franchise.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Arcueid Brunestud</a> is a millenia-old vampire, and essentially a living weapon who could kill any living thing in the time it takes a human to blink. She's also an extremely pleasant person, to the extent that her response to a crazed assailant hacking her to pieces is simply <em>confusion and curiosity at his ability to actually harm her</em> rather than any sort of anger or desire for revenge (and she proceeds to befriend, and possibly <em>fall in love with</em>, said assailant).
</li><li> Supplementary materials mention a handful of other vampires who refuse, for various reasons, to prey on humanity: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Zelretch, Van-Fem (he's non-hostile, anyway), Enhance, Merem (sorta)</a>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sion</span> manages to retain her human morality after being fully turned in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a></em> sequels (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">bizarre nature of her sire</a> might have had something to do with that).
</li><li> Sacchin also qualifies to an extent, despite being more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicMonster">Tragic Monster</a> in the original Tsukihime, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a></em> series.

On the other hand, her end battle quotes occasionally show off a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> side.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Rider</a>, meanwhile, plays with the trope somewhat; firstly, while she is technically undead, and she does survive primarily off of drinking blood by biting people's necks, she is not technically a vampire by the rules of the Nasuverse, which are somewhat more specific on the topic than that. Secondly, she's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> than traditionally <em>friendly</em>, and she's an outright antagonist (and a fairly brutal one) in two out of three routes (along with a chunk of the third). One of the big twists of the Heaven's Feel route, however, is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Shinji</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Matou</a> is not actually her Master, his sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Sakura</a> is. And Rider <em>absolutely fucking hates Shinji,</em> hates everything he asks her to do, and turns out to be perfectly pleasant, if somewhat socially awkward and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">homicidally devoted</a> to her true Master, the moment Shinji no longer has her leash.

<ul><li> Addison Constance Loveworth from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IronGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IronGate">IronGate</a></em> definitely fits in here, she's a dainty little 19th century vampire lady: always trying to help while being unfailingly polite, disliking violence and only sipping bovine blood from fine china.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OrangeMarmalade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OrangeMarmalade">Orange Marmalade</a></em> centers around a vampire who is trying to fit into human society. Vampires in this setting, after a near extermination of their species, now survive off of pigs blood, under heavy regulation by the government and the slightest of crimes can get them arrested or worse. Society and people for the most part <em>despise</em> and fear vampires, wanting and desiring nothing more than to see them wiped out. As such, Ma-ri, the female protagonist pretends to be human as best as she can and does her best not to reveal her secret.
</li><li> Gin from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Minion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Minion">Minion</a></em> in a Friendly Neighborhood Werewolf, the whole "minion of a dark-witch-for-hire" thing notwithstanding.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em>, Sam is a parody of these; he attempts to be brooding and angsty, but often switches right back to the sleazy, upbeat guy he was pre-vampirization. One arc had him walking right into a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffytheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffytheVampireSlayer">Buffy</a></em> parody.
<ul><li> It's worth noting that Sam is NOT a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VegetarianVampire">Vegetarian Vampire</a>; though he is generally a good guy and avoids killing people, he has no problem hypnotizing people and drinking their blood, and when a group of evil vampires tricked him into thinking he had killed one of his victims while blackout drunk, his reaction was "oh, well".

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LifeSketch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LifeSketch">Life Sketch</a></em>, vampires are so commonplace that it came as a huge shock when one of them started attacking humans. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And even then, it wasn't a real vampire.</span> They even serve blood in restaurants like the O.K.

In fairness, it may just be that most of the few Transylvitans who get much screen time happen to be those that come across as arrogant jerks, rather than it being a racial/national thing.

He is willing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> all but bankrupt Transylvito trying to save Slately, and appears genuinely remorseful when he eventually decides/is convinced he can't empty Transylvito's treasury to loan Jetstone the funds they need (which probably won't do anything but delay the inevitable anyway)</span>.

The rest of her family drinks blood, but they don't kill the people they feed on.
<ul><li> Subverted to an extent, when it's revealed quite a few vampires in the past were VERY evil, and they aren't 'nice'.
</li></ul></li><li> This is mostly avoided in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CharbyTheVampirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CharbyTheVampirate">Charby the Vampirate</a></em> though when one of the vampire hunters girlfriends is turned she seems to be able to keep her humanity due to him supplying her with blood, he does wonder if she is just pretending and staying with him for the free food. Charby himself finds this difficult after promising not to kill any more humans since he can't really control his bloodlust, eventually slipping up and killing a teenager without even any intent to feed on her due to his strength.
</li><li> Liz from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Blip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Blip">Blip</a></em>, by her own admission, used to be evil, but she's turned her life around and hasn't killed anyone in centuries. She gets her fix from raw meat and large quantities of animal blood stashed in her basement.

</li><li> Cody from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AngelOfDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AngelOfDeath">Angel of Death</a></em> is a lich, not a vampire, and eats human souls instead of drinking human blood. Other than that though, he fits this perfectly.
</li><li> Subverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor">CollegeHumor</a> sketch, "The Six Monsters You'll Have for Roommates." The "vampire" isn't actually a vampire, just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth">Gothy</a> college kid who happens to share some traits with them: he stays out all night, has an aversion to sunlight (because he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAMorningPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAMorningPerson">Not a Morning Person</a>, probably because he's out partying all night), is never seen eating (or at least doesn't eat garlic bread), and has <em>no</em> trouble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">hooking up with several different girls</a>.

Sure, he needs to drink human blood once in a while to live, but he doesn't drain anyone to death. Unless it's brought up, you almost forget that he's a vampire.
</li><li> Lucius Marcell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/EdeValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/EdeValley">Ede Valley</a></em> is this.

Historically this wasn't always true, then there was a blood plague that had minor effects on the carriers but was fatal for any vampires who fed on them. The vampires who accepted their prophet and coexisted peacefully were able to find willing clean donors, and mostly pulled through. The others had to take their chances, and mostly died out.

<ul><li> The Ruby-Spears cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fangface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fangface">Fangface</a></em> had a friendly (and very goofy) werewolf, whose transformations seemed more or less psychosomatic (often triggered by <em>pictures</em> of the full moon or sun). This is a Ruby-Spears example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, as the supporting cast all seemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">to have supplies of durable picture-postcards of the full moon or sun in their back pockets</a>, and relevant images often cropped up in the story whenever the script started to lag.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a> lived next door to The Gruesomes, a family of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters">Munsters</a>-inspired monster-like creatures, who were otherwise just as normal as anyone else in that show.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula">Count Duckula</a> is very friendly... much to the chagrin of his butler Igor, who wants him to go back to the business of sucking blood and being scary.

Interesting in that he WAS evil, but became good after his "death". Of course, Doctor Von Goosewing is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">convinced beyond a doubt</a> that Duckula is a murdering fiend and continually tries to destroy him.
</li><li> The titular <em>Drak Pack</em> and their mentor, Count Dracula. Not so much the monsters of O.G.R.E., though.
</li><li> Sibella Dracula from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheGhoulSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooAndTheGhoulSchool">Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School</a></em> is just the cutest thing.

Marceline doesn't feed on <em>blood</em>, just the color red; on the other hand, whether she's "friendly" depends on how entertaining she finds you. Her alignment seems to balance out at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a>: in her introductory episode, she's antagonistic towards Finn and Jake until Finn manages to land a punch on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form, but in her second appearance, she tricks Finn into becoming her "evil" henchman, with the twist that all the "evil" deeds she ropes him into are actually unambiguously <em>good</em> (her "army of the undead" is actually the entertainment at a party, the adorable-looking plant she orders Finn to kill is actually a horrifying monster, etc.). Later appearances have put her in this category, with her not really doing any evil, though she does have her moments like only going after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> father to get her bass/family ancestral axe, back.

</div></li><li> Spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>, where The Count from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoHarmless">Not So Harmless</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Newcomer:</strong> <em>[sees all the other </em>Sesame Street<em> figures with fangs, feasting on blood]</em> The Count turned you all into the undead! <br/><strong>The Count:</strong> If you thought I was a vampire in every way but that one, then I count <em>one</em>, one dumb motherfucker.

</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonaTheVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonaTheVampire">Mona the Vampire</a></em>. The titular Mona only <em>pretends</em> to be a vampire and the actual supernatural threat of the episode is purely in the imaginations of her and her friends (there's always a completely rational explanation for what the "threat" actually was), but within the realms of her imagination she's a vampire who is friendly and heroic.
</li><li> The version of Dracula seen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em> isn't exactly friendly, but he's a senior citizen who can't do much (intentional) harm in his old age, and he initially lives in a retirement home for monsters. He later moves into Billy and Mandy's neighborhood after we find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Irwin is his grandson</span>. Based on the previous statement, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Irwin</span>, definitely counts as well.

He is the episode's client rather than the antagonist, enlisting Granny's help to find who stole his coffin, and is shown as being very friendly to Granny and her pets.

While they tried to suck Ami and Yumi's talent in their debut episode, their subsequent appearances showed them to be on better terms with the Japanese rock duo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vampirina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Vampirina">Vampirina</a></em>, Vee and her family are all Transylvanian vampires adapting to life in Pennsylvania, and are all friendly to their neighbors.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WelcomeToTheWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WelcomeToTheWayne">Welcome to the Wayne</a></em>, Andrei is a good friend of Team Timbers and he is very friendly and calm sometimes even when he is in danger, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but after being exposed to "Rainbow Gas also called "Beam" which power-ups vampires but with the side effect of turning them aggressive and making them lose control, he eventually becomes less dangerous but he's not completely cured until his friends find the antidote</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IAmWeasel">I Am Weasel</a></em> episode "I Am Vampire" had I. M.
