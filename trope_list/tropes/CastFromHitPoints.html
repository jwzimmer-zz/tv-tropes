What do you do? Spend your own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a> on the spell in place of whatever would normally power it. The spell is then Cast From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>.
</p><p>The cost of the life energy thus expended will vary. In extreme cases, a spell cast from HP may cost the caster their life, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>; this is often done for the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a>. When done by multiple casters at once, this qualifies as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack">Combined Energy Attack</a>. Lesser versions may result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">a decreased lifespan</a>, which is typically given in round numbers such as years. Whether this is cut from physical longevity or some kind of cosmic clock depends on the series. At its mildest, casting from HP leads to immediate physical effects such as fatigue or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicNosebleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicNosebleed">Psychic Nosebleed</a>. Casting from hit points in a way that causes irreversible/cumulative damage to the caster is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerDegeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerDegeneration">Power Degeneration</a>, while fueling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> from hit points is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicRROD">Heroic RRoD</a>.

A spell cast from HP may work normally, but more often than not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality">the plot demands</a> that the use of life itself must amplify the effect dramatically. If done well, this may represent the caster's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a>.
</p><p>Some fantasy settings have this as their standard system of magic. In those cases, the process will typically exact a price significantly less than the life of the caster. Particularly common in settings featuring magic which has limits and obeys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">scientific</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">pseudo</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">scientific</a>) principles to some degree. A common form of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a> if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerAtAPrice">costs</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkArts">exceptionally steep.</a>
</p><p>Not every spell used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> involves casting from HP. A parting shot may hurt the caster, but unless it is the act of casting that does this, it doesn't qualify as casting from HP. Usually, you can be healed after casting from HP — when there is no way to recover at all from the loss, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">Cast from Lifespan</a> instead. When the sacrifice is of mental rather than physical health, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">With Great Power Comes Great Insanity</a>. A revival spell that harms the caster likely falls into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialRevivalSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialRevivalSpell">Sacrificial Revival Spell</a>.

<ul><li> The Caster's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">three most powerful shells</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">#4</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight">#9</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirteenIsUnlucky">#13</a>, work at the cost of the user's life force. Firing two will leave the user winded, and a third will bring them near death. "Just like, you know..." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gene fires four in a short period of time.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise, the line between ordinary attacks, Cast from Hit Points, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">Cast from Lifespan</a> is blurry; characters use their ki to fire attacks, which is roughly analogous to their fighting power. To at least some extent, all ki attacks are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromStamina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromStamina">Cast From Stamina</a>, but may have extra costs as well. Energy attacks can cause a huge exertion on the user's body, leaving them out of breath or weakened.
<ul><li> Tenshinhan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Kikoho</a> (and Shin Kikoho) draws on his life force to attack with, something that inherently adds to an attack's potency, as shown by its effect on Cell in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. In a straight fight, Tenshinhan's power is nothing compared to Cell's, but by using his Kikoho, Tenshinhan is able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">hold off Cell</a> long enough for Android 18 to escape, but then collapses from the exertion. When the user is in good health the risks associated with it are minimal, but when Tenshinhan uses it on Nappa in a rage shortly after having his arm cut off, the strain is too great and he dies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Mafuba/Evil Containment Wave</a> was initially stated to be so taxing as to kill the user without fail, and indeed both Mutaito and Roshi die after they use it. If it actually <em>always</em> kills the user is somewhat unclear: in the anime Tien uses it against Drum (having aimed for Piccolo) and survives<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0mqy7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0mqy7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0mqy7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although it failed at the last second because Piccolo destroyed his jar, Roshi missing the jar didn't keep him from dying</span>. Both the anime and manga have Kami using the wave on Piccolo Jr., which he survives even though Piccolo reversed it on him; he even stated beforehand that it provided a way to stop Piccolo without killing him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantLiveWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantLiveWithoutYou">which would also kill himself.</a> Both of these suggest that a significantly strong body could survive without long-term consequence, there just wasn't anyone known to be strong enough before then. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> proves that strong enough people can use the technique without too much worry with the health. Master Roshi, Piccolo, Goku and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Trunks</span> manage to learn and use it well without too much worry, which makes sense given their <em>astronomic</em> power.
</li><li> Goku's Kamehameha also seems to draw on his energy reserves a lot, as shown in his fight with Perfect Cell; after blowing Cell to pieces with the attack, Goku's power level dropped dramatically. In fact, when the Kamehameha is used in the original <em>Dragon Ball</em>, Master Roshi flips out at the fact that Goku, Krillin and Yamcha all used it <em>because</em> of this. In fact, everyone panics at Krillin and Yamcha doing it because they shouldn't be able to handle it!
</li><li> Goku's Kaioken is a pretty straight example. When used at low power and in short bursts, it can be used almost indefinitely. When used the way Goku does it, sometimes boosting its effect as high as <em>20 times</em> normal, it inflicts a great deal of damage on the user. In fact, in <em>Super</em> it is explicitly stated that the strain of using the Kaioken is so great that attempting to use it while also transformed into a Super Saiyan would have been suicide. It's only <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the extremely precise ki control of Super Saiyan Blue allows Goku to even <em>attempt</em> to use the Kaioken while transformed, a move he estimates has a <em>90% chance of killing him</em>. Even after the fight, the strain is so great he loses control of his ki entirely for a while.</span>
</li><li> Goku's transformation into a Super Saiyan 3 also serves to do this; the physical strain on his body of maintaining the state and using energy attacks whilst in it is enough to drain him of all his energy in a very short time.
</li><li> Vegeta also did this against Buu, sacrificing himself, but it wasn't enough.
</li></ul></li><li> In the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear">Prétear</a></em>, the Leafe Knights' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a> are connected to their own Leafe (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a>); overusing these powers drains their Leafe, regardless whether the attacks are performed by the Knights themselves or by Himeno when she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">merges with them</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the backstory, three of them died from overusing their powers in order to seal Takako, and were reborn; Shin, the youngest of them, dies for the <em>second</em> time after Himeno merges with him.</span> In the anime, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to seal the Tree of Despair, Himeno overloads it with her own Leafe and dies in the process. Only Hayate's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLovesKiss">True Love's Kiss</a> can bring her back.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the game of Monster World, Bakura (a white magician) converted his hit points to magic points to keep up a magic barrier when Zorc was blasting them. This is also the main rule in the Ancient Egyptian precursor to the Magic &amp; Wizards/Duel Monsters game; Monster Spirits are summoned by sacrificing Ba (life force) instead of the modern life points system. Damage is also taken by decreasing the life force of the duelist, implying that a defeated duelist dies.
</li><li> Dark Bakura's second tabletop RPG employs this for all the character cards. When a character uses his/her Ba to empower/summon a Monster Spirit or gets damaged, it decreases their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yusuke Urameshi funnels his life energy into a last-ditch assault on at least one occasion, in the final phases of his fight with Suzaku of the Four Saint Beasts. The strain leaves him unconscious and on the verge of (another) death, and it takes Kuwabara channeling some of his own life energy into him to save him.
</li><li> Kuwabara's energy blade is directly provided by his spirit energy, so when he runs out of it he'll remain vulnerable until a rest (as shown after his fight against Byakko). It's notably less costly with the ultimate form of the blade (Dimensional Sword), likely to make up for the great difficulty of pulling it off in the first place.
</li><li> Kurama attempts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> during the Dark Tournament using this trope.

<ul><li> Usagi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Silver Crystal</a> worked this way for dramatic tension; it's explicitly commented on in two movies, specifically her (temporary) death after using it while already exhausted in the first movie.

In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a>, Usagi's ability to have the senshi safely boost her power may explain why its use decreases later in the series.
</li><li> While the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> version seems more powerful and less dangerous to use, late in the manga, Sailor Moon's (temporarily) <em>entire body disintegrated completely</em> from its use. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then again she was technically using <em>all</em> the Sailor Crystals to defeat Chaos.</span>

Since her energy is running low to begin with, using it shortens her remaining lifespan dramatically. Mercilessly made explicit by the "Days until Mahoro stops functioning" counter that is shown after every episode. There will always be a significant drop in numbers whenever she uses it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos">Infinite Stratos</a></em> does a technological example of this. IS battles end when one side's energy shields are depleted in order to avoid injury to the pilot — in fact, the unshielded IS instantly shuts down to prevent further fighting. The protagonist's most effective (and for a long while, only) attack is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserBlade">Reiryaku Byakuya</a>, which saps his own shields to pierce through the enemy's and score an instant kill.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, jutsu require chakra and stamina to be used. In most cases, ninja get to the point where they're unable to use jutsu when they're low on chakra, but if they run out, they die.
<ul><li> Rock Lee's Eight Gates are a straighter example of this. The more he opens, the more powerful he becomes, but the greater the strain it puts on his body. It's stated that if anyone opens all eight gates (known as Hachimon Tonkō no Jin, or Eight Gates Released Formation (Eight Inner Gates Formation in the dub)), he or she will die, which is why the eighth and final gate is called Shimon — the Gate of Death. In Lee's case, his muscles actually ripped when he opened the fourth gate, appropriately named Shōmon — the Gate of Pain.
</li><li> How powerful can a ninja be when all eight gates are open? Powerful enough to be able to curbstomp a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>. Demonstrated when Guy performed this technique and went to wipe the floor with Madara, who at that time was the Ten-Tails host and was previously curb-stomping the most powerful ninjas in the world. Guy even gets complimented by Madara for being the first one to actually give him a challenge, but points out that it would only be a matter of time before Guy's technique ends and all Madara has to do is wait it out since it didn't (or couldn't, anyway) kill him. Madara was using Perfect Susano'o, said to be impenetrable. <em>Guy's final attack shattered it</em>. Madara's only saving grace was being undead and thus having unlimited chakra with which to replenish his Susano'o. Said technique was mastered by Might Dai, Guy's own father. How strong was he with it? Enough to where he was able to go toe-to-toe with <em>all Seven Swordsmen of the Mist</em> at the same time in order to save his son and his comrades. While the battle did take his life, he manages to kill <em>four of the Swordsmen</em> and left the other three severely beaten.
</li><li> Choji Akumichi's "Butterfly Mode", at least when it's introduced, is in the form of a pill that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromCalories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromCalories">rapidly burns off all of the body's fat</a> and muscle. As Choji was, it was entirely likely that it would kill him, he only survives because he was just fat enough that he still had enough nutrients to keep him alive until he could get medical aid. In <em>Shippuden</em>, Choji shows during the war arc that he's become able use butterfly mode to no adverse effects, though it still slims him down (presumably because he can manifest it through his own chakra, instead of requiring the pill.)

<ul><li> While it's not strictly magic, there's the Impact Dial, which can absorb and fire any physical force. However, the recoil is exactly the same force as the actual impact, meaning that whoever uses it takes as much damage as they deal with it. The improved version, the Reject Dial, actually increases the power of the impact, but it's said that using it twice will cause the user to die. After being told this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Wiper then proceeded to use it three times and survived</a>.
</li><li> Luffy's Gear Second leaves him thoroughly exhausted after use, as it speeds up his blood flow to increase his power, which also speeds up how fast his body absorbs and processes nutrients.

</li><li> Chi manipulation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a></em> apparently works this way, at least in defensive uses. Hakkai exhausts himself to the point of fainting when he has to heal Gojyo after not having enough sleep, and it's mentioned outright that trying to do this when injured can kill him. He also gets weak after holding up a chi barrier for too long, trying to save the party from being buried alive in an underground room.

Fortunately, he can pass his power onto somebody healthier, and chooses protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalAntiHero">Izuku</a> for the role. Even after passing on his power, All Might retains a remnant of it that allows him to keep being a superhero, but but the strain gets even worse. Whenever he exceeds his time limit, he ends up with an even shorter time limit going forward. Naturally, All Might keeps getting forced to exceed his time limit to defeat powerful villains. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To defeat his nemesis All For One, All Might burns out essentially <em>all</em> of his remaining power and can now only change into his super form for <em>one second</em>. This forces him to retire from heroics permanently, depriving the world of its "Symbol of Hope".</span>
</li><li> Izuku himself is another example, since unlike All Might, his body is too weak to use One for All's full power without him breaking his limbs, so he often finds himself forced to use it sparingly, usually with a few fingers as opposed to his whole arm, until he becomes strong enough to master it properly. He too is repeatedly forced to exceed his limits to defeat powerful foes, resulting in him spending a lot of time in hospital beds recovering from self-inflicted injuries.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">Recovery Girl</a>'s powers also work like this, except that it takes the hit points of those whom she's healing, not herself.

The user then must tame the Juuma and form a contract with it which lets him summon the Juuma whenever he wants. However, each usage taps into the Life Energy of the wielder, and a normal human would exhaust his forces and die quickly. However, Wu such as Benares and Yakumo are completely immortal and thus can make full use of their Juuma. The sole human Juuma-user, Sarlama, had to replace her own limbs with them and her entire abdomen is completely dried up and horrifying to look at. The same, to a lesser extent, goes from all the magical arts, which according to Connery are fueled by life force.

<ul><li> For the most part, whenever a card effect in the card game requires a cost to activate, it's generally one of two things: a discard from your hand or deck or a payment of life points. Considering that the loss of either resource in their entirety means game over for you, this is very much a Cast from Hit Points scenario. The third is typically the sacrifice of a monster, which also fits, even if it's not <em>your</em> hit points you're using.
</li><li> The Lightsworn-archetype Deck uses the first type, as several of the monsters and spell/trap cards discard two to three cards from the top of your deck after activation or at the end of every turn. The recently added Psychic-type monsters normally drain Life Points to use their effects, but there are also a few that give some back.

There was no MP or Mana to speak of, so monsters and your own character would use the same life force to cast magic with that they'd use to absorb damage from the enemy. Additionally, summoning your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Mons</a> cost the protagonist life energy equal to the beastie's hitpoints — in the video game its remaining HP would be refunded to the hero at the end of the battle. All this combined made for an interesting level of strategy wherein you would have to decide whether the loss of life was worth being able to kill the enemy that much faster (and also made heal spells rather dubious in their usefulness — the amount healed is almost always lower than what it costs to cast in the first place).

Some items (such as Rusty Sword) damage the user when destroyed, while others can constantly drain from your health for some benefit (like Enraged which allows the player to draw an extra card at the cost of one health a turn).
</li><li> In <em>Lycee TCG</em>, since the orthodox way to lose the game is having no cards in your deck when you're supposed to draw one, your deck effectively acts as your HP. The more powerful Standard Abilities usually requires you to discard cards directly from your deck.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Eragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Eragon">Eragon</a></em>, magic is very rarely used because it drains the caster. Indeed, the main character almost dies by using magic. Specifically, spells use the same amount of energy that the caster would have to expend to perform the same task without magic. Using a spell to, say, lift a penny off the the floor right in front of you would be almost effortless.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> series has this as a common technique. Everything has to draw energy from somewhere, even magic, and the wizard's own energy sometimes represents the most convenient source. With everyday magic, this simply leads to fatigue if overused, the magic equivalent of exercising strenuously. Magic that can save the day, however, is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifespan">Cast from Lifespan</a> instead. This arises several times in the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> including as the primary plot of the second book, Deep Wizardry</span>. One shield spell in <em>High Wizardry</em> costs a year of the casters life for each blast it absorbs (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">granted, these are attacks from a distracted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Lone Power</a></span>), and the characters discuss it during the fight: "What if you're scheduled to get hit by a car or something in less than a year?" "I'd better look both ways then."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoriesOfIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemoriesOfIce">Memories of Ice</a></em>, the third book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MalazanBookOfTheFallen">Malazan Book of the Fallen</a></em> series, the use of healing magic in great quantities is fatal for Karnadas, the Destriant (High Priest) of the Grey Swords after he expends the last of his energy on healing Shield-Anvil Itkovian after he's already healed several of the other Grey Swords.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>, magic is cast by expending the caster's physical energy. It takes as much energy to do something magically as it would to do something physically. In addition, once an incantation has been uttered, the caster must commit to the spell, even if it kills them. Knowing your limits is very important for a spellcaster in this universe. Dragon riders have an advantage: a rider can borrow his <em>dragon's</em> hit points to cast spells. Dragons, needless to say, have lots. As of book 2, Eragon learns to cast spells by drawing energy from his environment, which kills the surrounding wildlife, but doesn't cause him any serious harm (it affects him emotionally, though). He also learns to invest his energy into gemstones, after which he can use it to power spells without exhausting himself. In book 3, yet another power source is introduced: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">magical stones that come from dragons and also serve as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jars</a></span>.

Alternatively, a mage can simply burn themselves out like a candle to perform a "final strike", the idea being that if you have to die, by god you're going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">take someone out with you</a>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, more than one protagonist mage uses the Final Strike to achieve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingMomentOfAwesome">Dying Moment of Awesome</a>. If the Shin'a'in get absolutely desperate, one of their Shamans or Swordsworn may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to invoke divine intervention. It's implied that the same rules also apply for those with particularly powerful versions of the Gifts that also operate in the series. The power Lavan Firestorm unleashed is uncannily similar to a mage's Final Strike and the results equally cataclysmic.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDawnhounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDawnhounds">The Dawnhounds</a></em>, weaving requires life energy going in to put magic out.

It almost kills her and is written in such a way to suggest doing so also shears years off of her life. In the same book, it's also hinted to the reader that using psionic abilities also works like this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VelveteenVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VelveteenVs">Velveteen vs.</a></em>, this is how Velveteen's powers work, though she's not aware of it until an incident halfway through the second anthology in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jackie Frost discovers that Velveteen's malaise and fainting spells have been caused by the effort of keeping her boyfriend, Tag, in a state of reanimation after his death in a fight with an evil dentist (no, really), and that continuing this will kill her.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth">Sword of Truth</a></em> series, a wizard can cast Wizard's Life Fire, a powerful explosion that kills the wizard but usually reduces whoever is nearby to ashy stains on the walls. The taste of said ashes yields a clue as to why the dying wizard chose to cast Wizard's Life Fire: if the ashes are bitter, the wizard cast the spell to save himself from torture; if they are sweet, the wizard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSuicide">gave his life to save another</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>:
<ul><li> A wizard's "Death <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Curse">Curse</a>" instantly kills the caster in order to inflict some horrible punishment on its recipient. Regular magic can hurt a wizard as well; when Harry conjures a rage-fueled firestorm in one book, he has a heart attack after sustaining it for too long.
</li><li> There's also the use of Soulfire, which allows a caster to infuse some of their own soul into their spells to boost the power and effect of the spell. Unlike Hellfire, however, Soulfire isn't destructive, but rather constructive. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry ends up using Soulfire to generate a powerful hand-like construct of force to beat the hell out of a Denarian spellcaster.</span> The drawback behind using Soulfire, of course, is that it uses <em>your soul</em> as the fuel to empower your spells.

</li></ul></li><li> Some of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy">Fighting Fantasy</a></em> books, especially the aptly named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sorcery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sorcery">Sorcery!</a></em> four-parter, have EVERY spell being cast at a cost of health.
</li><li> In books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>, desperate bad-guy mages often kill themselves by using their own life energy for magic once they've run out of any other kind of magic. Usually, this is accompanied by one of the major characters shouting at them to stop or else they'll kill themselves, a warning they never heed. Although it's definitely not limited to the bad guys, as Ochobou burned out her magic and herself taking down five mages of her level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TortallUniverse">Trickster</a></em>. And in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Circle of Magic</a> book <em>The Will of the Empress</em>, when the Discipline four (who at this point in the books are basically the strongest mages in the world when they stand together) use their magic to break the border of Namorn, they are left extremely hungry and tired for days. Briar says that if they hadn't drawn power from all across the empire, they would be dead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind">The Name of the Wind</a></em> uses a system similar to this — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Sympathy</a> is essentially a magical form of energy transfer. If you are good at it, and don't care about your own health, you can transfer the heat of your blood into something to set it on fire. This is not good for you. One upside is that instead of running out of mana, sympathists run out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">fire</a>.
</li><li> All spells in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WindOfTheForelands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WindOfTheForelands">Wind Of The Forelands</a></em> cost life energy, apparently of the nonreplaceable type. This, incidentally, is why the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Witch Species</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">so frail</a>. Mages from <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagisterTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagisterTrilogy">Magister Trilogy</a></em> are the same way, though the eponymous Magisters are those who have learned how to cast from <em>other people's</em> HP.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesStross">Charles Stross</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLaundryFiles">The Laundry Files</a></em> series features magic as multiverse trickery invoked by high-level mathematics, with a nicely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaved</a> reference to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and good ol' Schrodinger's Cat to explain why the more powerful spells require human sacrifice. While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">the reasoning breaks down a bit</a> for smaller spells that just require some blood, it does provide an alternative motivation for the Holocaust: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ghostapo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ghostapo">the Nazis were attempting to destroy enough souls to create a portal to a parallel universe</a> and summon a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">weakly godlike entity.</a></span> Beyond this, you can "run" a spell in your head as long as you don't mind some minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> taking a small bite out of your brain. Doing this too often, even accidentally, results in Kranzberg's syndrome and a permanent trip to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedlamHouse">St. Hilda's</a>.
</li><li> How the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Returned</a> work in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Warbreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a></em>. Most people in that world have an energy called Breath that can be used to fuel magic, but if it's completely drained they just lose magical ability (and a certain degree of keenness of the senses) until they can acquire more from someone else. The Returned, however, are kept alive by one immensely powerful Breath — this allows them to perform miracles beyond the capacity of ordinary magic, for the cost of their life. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The sword Nightblood, resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a>, also functions like this, drawing on the Breaths of its wielder to fuel its powers. If the wielder runs out of Breaths while still using the sword, the results... aren't pretty</span>.
</li><li> Sorta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em>. For a Wizard to do something, it takes as much energy to do something magically as it does physically, unless you can harness an outside force. Having no outside force makes the Wizard rely on the leverage of his mind, meaning if they try to do something too difficult, their brain flicks out their ears. Example: Galder Weatherwax makes a protrusion of stone on the University fall, allowing him to zoom upwards.
</li><li> Psionics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecondGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecondGate">The Second Gate</a></em> normally channel energy they've "metabolized" and stored, but in a pinch, they can draw power directly from their biological functions. The mind instinctively tries to cut off psionic connections to prevent permanent damage at the same time, which can result in anything from mild burnout to a coma — which is usually too late to save the user anyway.
</li><li> While after the first book of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> series, magic functions by drawing power from the Moon Gods, before they are unsealed all magic is used with the caster's own energy, as shown whenever Raistlin uses too many consecutive spells and is left exhausted.
</li><li> All spells in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackMagicianTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackMagicianTrilogy">The Black Magician Trilogy</a></em> reduce the caster's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unless said caster is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Black Magician</a>, who may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining">use others' Hit Points instead</a></span>.
</li><li> Magic-users in <em>The Soprano Sorceress</em> and its sequels use their own body's reserves to cast; they have to eat like bargees just to keep their weight up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld">Everworld</a></em>, magic-users are shown to weaken if they use too much power, leading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Jalil</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">wonder</a> if magic burns calories. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Merlin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/Merlin">Merlin</a>, for example, is so tired after his battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Loki</a> that it's months before he is able to fully recover.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy">Bartimaeus Trilogy</a></em>, the most vital part to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">Golem</a>'s functioning is a magical scroll inserted into the construct's mouth. The writing of said scroll drains the vitality out of the writer to be transferred into the golem, and writing more than one manuscript (at least in a short time) is likely to kill you. (Though since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">golems completely neutralize all demon magic in their vicinity</a> and all of magicians' power is based on demon magic, one is often enough.)
</li><li> In <em>The Ring of Solomon</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this turns out to be a serious drawback of the eponymous ring - it gives whoever wears it total control over a godlike entity and allows them to summon tens of thousands of obedient spirits in an instant... but merely touching it is enough to cause burning pain, wearing it even moreso, and actually <em>using</em> it will induce agony, fatigue and exhaustion, and will drain the wielders life force significantly over time, killing them if they overuse it - King Solomon was a healthy young man when he found it, but the ring's power eventually reduces him to a prematurely aged, withered husk of his former self, a fact he hides from the world with powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Glamour">illusions</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctrineOfLabyrinths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctrineOfLabyrinths">Doctrine of Labyrinths</a></em>, mending <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Virtu</span> leaves Felix unconscious for two days, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">slits one of his wrists</a> in order to lay to rest the ghost of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Magnus Cordelius</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> novels see this a couple of times with mythals.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElminsterSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElminsterSeries">Elminster in Myth Drannor</a></em>, Cormanthor's greatest elven high mage sacrifices his life to create the city's mythal, his life's work.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReturnOfTheArchwizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReturnOfTheArchwizards">Return Of The Archwizards</a>: The Sorcerer</em>, set several hundred years later, another high mage sings himself into the mythal over Evereska to help repair it after the damage done to it by the phaerimm siege.
</li></ul></li><li> In Steven King's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Firestarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Firestarter">Firestarter</a></em>, Charlie's father gets progressively worse physical damage from using his mental powers, from headaches to a ruptured vessel in one eye to a full-on stroke.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessSeries">Princess</a></em> series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCHines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCHines">Jim C. Hines</a>, this rule essentially applies to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Snow White; in this version of the tale, the 'dwarves' are actually seven elemental spirits- Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Shadow, Light, and Magic- and while they will serve Snow loyally when summoned, summoning them costs Snow seven years of her life. As a result, Snow is only in her early twenties, but after summoning the 'dwarves' twice she looks like she's in her mid-thirties</span>.
</li><li> Feruchemy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy">Mistborn: The Original Trilogy</a></em> falls somewhat under this trope. A Feruchemist can draw off any of a variety of attributes from himself, then store them in pieces of metal to be withdrawn later. For example, if you become half as strong as you normally would be for an hour, you can then later become one and an half times as strong as you should be for an hour.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarDarlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarDarlings">Star Darlings</a></em> franchise, wish energy is what powers Starland, so using excessive amounts of energy granting small wishes makes Star Darlings exhausted.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChaosGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChaosGods">Chaos Gods</a></em> series, Ki normally uses magic provided by her god, Tavk. If Tavk chooses to withhold his power from her, she can cast spells using her own energy; but doing so consumes her own flesh as fuel.
</li><li> The heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MarketOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MarketOfMonsters">Market Of Monsters</a></em> has the power to (among other things) heal wounds at an accelerated rate, but doing so uses up energy and is harder if not impossible to do if she's ill, hurt extremely badly, sedated, or weak.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThatHideousStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThatHideousStrength">That Hideous Strength</a></em>: A variation: it's implied that using atlantean magic had a subtle negative effect on the user's health, though it wasn't specific what that was.

Notable examples would be Willow teleporting Glory away in <em>Blood Ties</em> (which leaves her bleeding, with headaches for weeks afterwards) and the portal-opening spell in <em>Get It Done</em> (which she casts from the hit points of Kennedy and Anya, the two strongest beings in the room).

Mawdryn tells the Doctor that the only way for them to die and end their torment would be for him to give each of them a surge of temporal energy taken from his remaining regenerations  this being his fifth incarnation, he'd have none left for himself.

They were so excited at the thought of having fresh vegetables that they didn't question the fact that they grew incredibly quickly, and it wasn't until they had actually eaten them that they discovered via a news report that the seeds were radioactive, and that what they had eaten would likely kill them. As the Professor tried to find a cure, some of them started to gain super powers due to the fact that the nutrients in the vegetables had been enhanced greatly. Gilligan, who had eaten the spinach, gained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> from the iron in it. Mary Ann gained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSenses">telescopic vision</a> from the vitamin A in the carrots, and Mrs. Howell gained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> from the enhanced sugar rush from sugar beets.

<ul><li> With the exception of Biofeedback, using psitalents inflicts nonlethal damage on the user.
</li><li> If an esper is out of power points, they can pay the difference in extra nonlethal damage to use their powers.
</li></ul></li><li> Mages in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> can burn some of their health for a quick boost in Mana. It also works the other way around, though this is easily the least efficient means of magical healing in the whole game. In the previous game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em>, a substance called Quintessence makes casting spells easier. A mage that runs out of Quintessence can rip some from their own body, damaging it in the process.
</li><li> Demons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheFallen">Demon: The Fallen</a></em> can enhance their powers by drawing energy from hitpoints... except that said hitpoints belong to their followers, not them.
</li><li> Many of the most powerful Tempesta Charms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrincessTheHopeful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrincessTheHopeful">Princess: The Hopeful</a></em> inflict unavoidable Resistant damage<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note03fzu');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note03fzu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note03fzu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Damage that cannot be magically healed</span> to use. Similarly, once per session anyone playing a follower of the Queen of Storms (Noble or Sworn) can declare that the Queen is manifesting power through her character. This allows her to use any Tempesta or unaligned charm with as many successes as desired and none of the <em>normal</em> casting costs, but inflicts one point of Resistant Lethal damage per success requested, which can and has killed servants of Storms in the past. On the other side of the War of Hope, the servants of the Darkness have the Self-Consuming Hunger Caligo, which lets them inflict Resistant damage on themselves to generate a special pool of faux Willpower that can be used to pay for other Calignes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em>, Ogre Butchers can cast a variety of Gut Magic. Along with the normal requirements of spells, they sometimes require the Butcher to inflict bodily harm on themselves. In particular, the Trollguts spell, which is the best out of the 6 available to the Ogres, but permanently takes off one health from the caster that cannot be regenerated in any way (whereas the other ones are usually avoidable unless you displease the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a>, and can be regenerated with another spell).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWitcherGameOfImagination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheWitcherGameOfImagination">The Witcher: Game of Imagination</a></em>, when mages cast spells beyond their current number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Arcane Points</a>, the difference is taken from HP. Certain spells by default go beyond the limit of Arcane Points one can have, causing casters to faint or drop dead after or <em>during</em> the casting. They should be instead used by a group of mages supporting each other or around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField">outside sources of magic energy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, as usual.
<ul><li> The psionics in AD&amp;D used a spell-point system even when the actual spellcasters use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">Vancian Magic</a>. Since an ability like Cast from Hit Points fits in so much better with a spell-point system, the 2nd edition had "Cannibalize", a power that allowed mid-level psionicists to get extra power points from damaging Constitution. The 'Death Field' power causes to everyone in the area of effect damage proportional to the sacrificed Hit Points 1:2 (or 1:1 for users of evil alignments).
</li><li> An unusual example of this is in the <em>Dragonlance Adventures</em> sourcebook for AD&amp;D. The dragonlances come in two types: Footman's and Mounted. Against normal enemies they do regular damage, but against the a dragon - the dragonlance doesn't roll for damage, it instead uses the wielder's hitpoints as the base damage and then adds any bonus damage from the wielder's strength and the dragonlance's enchantment (Mounted Dragonlances are even more powerful - they add the hitpoints of wielder and mount, and only mounts as large as a dragon can use the lance). So if a character keeps getting hurt in a fight, the base damage of the lance goes down. This aspect of the dragonlance also shows up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldBox">Gold Box</a> versions.
</li><li> The imaginatively-named Level 1 Necromancy spell, <em>Blade of Blood</em>, allows the caster to take 5 damage to make their attack deal extra 3d6 damage from exploding blood. It usually spells <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> for creatures of comparable level.
</li><li> 3E supplement <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EpicLevelHandbook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EpicLevelHandbook">Epic Level Handbook</a></em> has several extremely powerful spells, such as Hellball and Let Go of Me, work this way. The greatest example of this, however, is Vengeful Gaze of God, which deals 305d6 damage to an opponent while dealing 200d6 damage to the caster, who suffers from bleeding eyes and convulsing skin and, most of the time, dies. This spell will almost always kill anyone and anything it is used against, excluding the most powerful of monsters, who simply <em>might</em> be killed by it.
</li><li> 3E <em>Fiendish Codex II</em> offers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellfire">Hellfire</a> Warlock, which upgrades the warlock's standard attack from "kinda okay" to "nuclear inferno" at the cost of 1 Constitution drain per shot. Since Constitution affects both current and maximum HP, it's generally a good idea to have someone on standby with a restoration spell or a cheap wand of lesser restoration with the spell provided by a Paladin (it is even suggested in the fluff). To make it even better a Hellfire Warlock with one level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Binder</a> can gain an ability that automatically heals 1 point of ability damage a turn. Then there's classes like Legacy Champion which increase your effective level in another class, even beyond the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a>. Combine the two and you get a supercharged Hellfire Blast usable at will.
</li><li> The Blood Magus class from 3E's <em>Tome &amp; Blood</em> can sacrifice a little blood (hit points) to cast spells with slightly harder saving throws or replace material components. 3.5 <em>Complete Arcane</em> replaced its hit points damage with Constitution. And the 4e Blood Mage paragon path allows you to take damage to deal as much extra with encounter and daily spells. This was so abusable it needed to be nerfed with errata. Twice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>:
<ul><li> The AD&amp;D era had some of the more formidable spells involving sacrifice of the caster's hit points — either normal damage, permanent, or the loss incurable as long as the spell is active. This includes several spells from <em>Secrets of the Magister</em>. Which may be a legacy of old Elven <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a>, which includes 'Blood Dragon' — near-unstoppable mass killing spell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">requiring the caster's death</a>. Also, the Drow sometimes have "body weapon" enchantments as a last-ditch defence, which usually involves loss of a body part or other physical injury. E.g. <a class="urllink" href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Jalynfein">Jalynfein<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinGore">breaking a finger</a> and saying a word, could fire a burst of 24 magic missiles (cast normally, would be limited to 5). The Phaerimm dehydration spell 'lifedrain' (the one which made Anauroch a desert) also involves permanent sacrifice of a hit point, but holds for years — and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">dies with the caster</a>.
</li><li> The 3.5E sourcebook <em>Lost Empires of Faerûn</em> includes rules for creating mythals, persistent magical fields first developed by ancient elven high mages that block or buff specific spells and spell categories. Among the rules is the option to reduce the DC of the mythal creation by having the caster sacrifice his or her life to its completion. This is mentioned to often be welcomed by the elven high mages as the pinnacle of a many-centuries-long, very productive life.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer">Spelljammer</a></em> spell "Create Atmosphere" involves permanent hit point sacrifice from the caster. It makes a <em>cubic mile</em>/level of the air self-renewing for more than a year, after all.
</li><li> 2nd Edition <em>Al-Qadim</em> setting supplement <em>Arabian Adventures</em>. Casting the spell <em>Cleanse Water</em> drains 1d6 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> from the caster. The lost points can only be regained through natural healing, not by magic.
</li><li> 4th Edition
<ul><li> Bloodclaw Weapon would let you pay a small amount of HP with every attack, which then would be doubled or tripled if the attack hit. This ended up being so much more powerful than other weapon enchantments (especially for Fighters and Barbarians, which get more HP than other classes) that it was nerfed to a once-per-battle use and it STILL managed to be usable.
</li><li> The Blackguard subclass of the Paladin from Heroes of Shadow uses a variant of this mechanic as well, which is powerful enough to be their entire Striker damage bonus.
</li></ul></li><li> The 3E sourcebook <em>Book of Exalted Deeds</em> includes a category of spells called "sanctified magic" that can be cast by either divine or arcane spellcasters and require varying degrees of self-sacrifice to cast. This can be as simple as an "abstinence component"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note369eh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note369eh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note369eh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">e.g. you can't have sex or consume alcohol for a certain length of time prior to casting</span>, but it may also mean anything from ability drain on up to, in the case of Exalted Fury, death (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">you can be resurrected by the usual means, though</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em> magazine #229 article "Wu-jen: The Oriental Mage Revisited". This Asian-themed mage can cast any spell they know at any time, without the spell memorization standard wizards require. However, there is a cost: casting a spell costs the wu-jen 3 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> of damage per level of the spell. Considering how few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> wizards have, this is a serious penalty, restricting them even more than normal wizards unless they have a significant source of healing available. Even worse, they only get half the normal benefit from magical healing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpheresOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpheresOfPower">Spheres of Power</a> has the Draining Casting drawback. While it only deals nonlethal damage to you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>'s rules on nonlethal damage can still have it kill you.
</li><li> 5th Edition mainly removed this feature, but it survives in some places.
<ul><li> Wizards of the School of Evocation gain the <em>Overchannel</em> ability at higher levels, which enables them to maximize the damage of their spells of 5th level and below. The first use of the ability per long rest comes with no drawback; subsequent attempts without a break cause the wizard to take unavoidable necrotic damage that scales higher with stronger spells and more uses of the ability. As with the Wu-Jen above, 5E wizards are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">squishy</a> and can't usually spare the HP that they would lose from repeat Overchannels; players may do so at their own peril.
</li><li> The semi-official class Bloodhunter, made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer">Matthew Mercer</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CriticalRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CriticalRole">Critical Role</a> podcast, and later put up on <a class="urllink" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/blood-hunter">DNDBeyond<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, can imbue their weapons with blood or cast bloodmagic, but only using their own blood (consisting of taking damage equal to their level, so between 1 and 20).
</li><li> Theres also the spell <em>Life Transference</em>, available to wizards and clerics. The caster takes a not-insignificant amount of damage (4d8 at the spells lowest level), but is then able to restore <em>double</em> that amount of a friendly creatures hit points. Some characters are better suited to use this than others (Life Domain clerics, for instance, gain HP every time they heal a friendly creature, mitigating the risk to themselves somewhat) but overall its a potent, if situational, healing spell.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Dominion powers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Anathema" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Anathema">Anathema</a></em> are cast from your "anathema", which is your health.
</li><li> The previous edition (using the Revised Core Rulebook) of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> RPG rules generally had Force powers cost vitality (the system's version of Hit Points) to activate. If you didn't have enough vitality, you could even use wound points (representing real and dangerous — even potentially fatal — damage) to make up the difference. The only thing stopping characters from 'casting to death' is the fact that no Force power had a vitality cost so high that the damage could push a character far enough into the negatives to result in death.
</li><li> In the cooperative play game <em>Middle-Earth Quest</em>, your hero deck is also your 'life pool.' Any card you play in combat, or even to move around the map, costs you a hitpoint.
</li><li> In the German tabletop RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye">The Dark Eye</a></em> (aka <em>Das Schwarze Auge</em> in German), every magic user can do this, but not without consequences, usually additional damage and that damage might permanently reduce the maximum hitpoints of that character (only when he drops too low as a result of blood magic though). Excessive use of this in one of the novels leads to a mage permanently losing his ability to use magic. Later on, he uses a magic sword that also drinks from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a>, losing fingers on his good hand as a result.
</li><li> Epideromancers in the tabletop RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em> power all their magic by hurting themselves.
</li><li> In the live-roleplay system <em>Labyrinthe</em>, almost all supernatural abilities have an hp cost in addition to a mana cost. The amount of damage done is relative to the level of the ability relative to the level of the caster.
</li><li> In the Swedish Tabletop RPG Chronopia, Orcs have access to a very interesting magical discipline; <em>Painmagic</em>, ripping off a finger can grant you skill bonuses, cutting yourself can give you visions of the future and hacking off an arm or a leg can make you temporarily invulnerable. Not surprisingly, they have also developed plenty of rusty prosthetics complete with hidden sawblades and other nasty surprises to replace those limbs lost.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> allows casters to do this, though it's more difficult than using other energy sources, presumably because the pain makes it hard to concentrate. Usually, spells are powered with Fatigue Points (i.e. wizards get tired when they cast spells) or with enchanted "energy batteries" called powerstones. Once you burn through all your available FP (or earlier, if you choose), if you keep casting spells without resting, you start burning HP. Ordinarily, you can only use up hit points until you lose consciousness, at which point the energy drain stops (you don't die). The supplemental advantage "Word of Power" drains so much fatigue that it's guaranteed to drain life from a normal person. It will keep speaking itself even if the caster dies in mid sentence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PokemonTabletopAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PokemonTabletopAdventures">Pokemon Tabletop Adventures</a> has the Psychic class, capable of using certain Pokemon attacks, similar to the Martial Artist class. The martial artist's attacks can only be used a certain number of times per day, whereas the psychic's attacks can be used at will, but require this trope. (Thankfully, the nature of the psychic's key stats means they usually will have a large amount of HP to cast from.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a>: The Weird West</em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">Whateley family's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder">Blood Magic</a>, which consumes both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">"Strain"</a> and "Wind" (which would be "Subdual Damage" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/DungeonsAndDragons">other games</a>) as the caster's tainted blood is consumed by dark forces. All without even breaking the skin!
</li><li> As mentioned above, casting or controlling a spell in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Slayers">Slayers</a> d20</em> game is based on stamina (a Fortitude saving throw modified by caster level), and deals subdual damage to the caster based on the spell's difficulty and your margin of success. You get a hefty bonus to your control checks by voluntarily taking lethal damage, or it might happen anyway if you botch horribly enough.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Champions</a> characters who run out of Endurance can continue to use their powers by taking Stun damage, at a rate of 1d6 Stun per 2 Endurance required. This only works for powers that draw on the user's own Endurance pool, as opposed to the Endurance Reserve power. A character can literally knock himself out from overexertion.
</li><li> Ixtli, the Aztanli-specific Boons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em>, have a number of abilities that grant extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Legend</a> for physical sacrifices. The amount gained from bleeding another creature is half what you get for doing the same thing to yourself.
</li><li> Several powerful Charms and spells in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> require you to sacrifice health levels as part of their activation cost.
<ul><li> In high-paranoia games, where every attack might kill and so every attack must be answered with a Perfect Defense, <em>every</em> attack is cast from hit points: they cost charm activations and Essence, the two resources that fuel perfect defenses.
</li><li> There are also two spells that can be cost for minimum Essence (mana, magic points) expenditure but automatically kill you and deal significant damage to everyone around you.
</li><li> In fact, Dragon-Blooded have quite a percentage of Charms with the "Martyr" keyword. That means that they can be cast with greater effect, but killing the Exalt for sure. That is why they can be used with no Essence left. And some of such Martyr usages can last for generations.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Fireborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TableTopGame/Fireborn">Fireborn</a></em> had this as a potential side effect. It takes one(or a group) so much power to cast a spell to be built up. Depending on the situation, one can roll a lot of dice and hope to quickly cast it, or do so slowly and carefully. However, if you go over the needed number of successful rolls and charge up too much power, the excess physically damages you. Of course, one can eliminate this by learning ways to channel that overload into the spell, usually for enhanced range/duration/effect.
</li><li> The Sorcery power in the 1980's DC Heroes game had a function similar to this. Every time the power is used, the AP's (power rank) used is compared against his or her Spirit score (a combination of damage resistance and hit points versus mystical damage). Effectively, if he or she is using AP's lower than his or her Spirit, there's no problem. Otherwise, there's a chance of Spirit damage (affects the "hit points" versus mystic things, but not durability, that's always your maximum Spirit). If there's a significant difference between the two with the Sorcery being higher, the caster will likely be rendered unconscious by using a full powered spell.
</li><li> <em>Many</em> spells in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a></em>, and every spell costs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">sanity</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em>:
<ul><li> The hero Nightmist has multiple spells that damage her as well as achieve whatever the intended effect was, and her standard form's power draws two cards but hits her in the face for 2. She mitigates it with some fairly impressive healing options, plus a relic that allows her to deflect one instance of damage per turn, meaning that she can make a fairly impressive tank if she can keep her equipment out.
</li><li> Absolute Zero's playstyle is built around this, because opening the suit to let his power <em>out</em> also lets hot air <em>in</em> to hurt his altered body. His base set's power is to hit himself in the face, and he has multiple one-shots that hit him as well as the enemy. He uses Module equipment to turn ice damage into health and convert fire damage into outgoing frozen misery for whoever it hits (or direct it inwards to heal him if you have both out; with the right gear, setting him on fire will actually make him <em>healthier</em>).
</li><li> The Harpy has several cards that damage herself as well as enemies. One of her deck's key ongoings, Applied Numerology, exists both to mess around with her powers, and to mitigate self-damage effects.
</li><li> Dr Medico's Void Guard deck tends to involve hitting himself with energy or toxic damage to boost his healing output. He can also heal himself all the way up given a good run with Regeneration, though, so he can do really well if handled correctly and outfitted with the right cards.
</li><li> Fanatic's Sacrosanct Martyr and her Prime Wardens variant's power involve hitting herself with radiant damage in order to do things. She has a bit of healing to offset it, plus armour that stops her dying and resets her health to 10. For bonus points, her most damaging one-shot scales based on how much punishment she's taken.
</li><li> Lifeline's cards generally damage him for some bonus: for example, he has one that hits him and three opponents for 3 infernal damage, or one that pings him with Infernal but lets him play 2 or draw 3. He can wear armour to help him survive, though, and when he goes on a tear through enemy minions Vitality Battery can cover a lot of ground.
</li><li> Akash'Thriya's giant HP pool isn't just there for show: a bunch of her stuff to speed up the environment deck in order to more effectively use her Primordial Seeds involves hitting herself for toxic or psychic damage, and her main damaging power hits her before it hits anyone else. It also makes her really good at drawing fire from villains who target the highest HP.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KingdomDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/KingdomDeath">Kingdom Death: Monster</a></em> has monsters who's AI deck acts as their HP pool. If a monster is harmed, you discard AI cards. It also means that every time a monster acts, it is casting from HP.

Dropping Constitution too low will kill you; dropping Wisdom turns you into a deranged killing machine, and that you get to use powers for free is not much of a consolation prize.

The main catch is that the caster dies when casting it. (The other catch is that casting it requires several assistants, and all of them must agree on what they're wishing for. If even one of them dissents, the spell fails and the caster died for nothing.)
</li><li> Magic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> has everything it needs to be this. The attempt to gather and channel the necessary power for the spell can itself backfire and hurt the caster, especially if they're in a hurry, evocations always involve a mandatory hit to one's mental stress track (making it easy for a wizard to potentially knock him- or herself out with a few quick spells even if they all work as planned), one of the easier ways of adding power to a thaumaturgic ritual is to accept consequences reflecting mental or physical harm... Most of this is recoverable with time as long as the caster doesn't go overboard (simple mental stress doesn't even last from one scene to the next, for example), but it still serves as a major check on the power of magic in a game that, as per the source material, tends to focus rather a bit <em>on</em> it.

As a result, Blood Price is available as an always-on S-Ability that lets the user pay for a skill in double its MP cost in HP. This ability can be abused quite easily by Red Mages, who can cast two spells in succession: one to attack, and one to heal themselves covering the cost of both. Also an option is to target yourself and the enemy while using spells of an element your equipment lets you absorb. Even without self-healing, the ability is quite overpowered as HP increases with level while spell costs and MP regeneration do not, making the cost of spells less and less significant. Interestingly, several enemy units that have Blood Price equipped can't possibly learn it through normal means. Fighters also have Back Draft, a strong fire-based attack that slightly damages the user as well. However, they can equip fire-absorbing equipment, making it an attack that <em>heals</em> the user. Same applies for other similar moves but with different elements (the Lanista version is Dark).

When Noctis wields them, they give him massive boosts in his stats but each swing of them will drain some of your HP.

However, Urianger notices the weapon draws heavily upon Alisaie's aether, leaving her heavily drained.

Of course, when enemies use the same attacks on the party, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">they effectively get to do so without losing any HP</a>.

The HP are lost even if the attack misses, but in a setting where mid-level characters can have over a thousand HP, it's an insignificant price. There is also an item allowing you to sacrifice 25 HP to regain 50 spell points, three times when fully charged (5 if using the Epic version)

<ul><li> Many classes have spells and abilities that convert health into that classes form of mana. There are also spells that force a target to do this, and spellcasters tend to have a lot less health than mana. Special mention should be made of the warlock class whose main (if not sole) method of gaining mana in combat is by sacrificing their own health with Life Tap. In the revamped talent system in <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>, Warlocks even get a full tier of talents based around such spells.
</li><li> Paladins had the now-removed Seal of Blood/Martyr, which would reflect all the damage the paladin did back at them but made them do significantly more damage. The spell had to be removed because the damage they did was too much and too fast for the healers to keep up with; they'd literally burst themselves to death.

</li><li> Zul'jin can toggle his trait to increase his basic attack damage at the cost of health per attack. This actually works to his advantage, since he also gains attack speed based on how much health he's missing.
</li><li> Alexstrasza's main healing spell sacrifices a portion of her current health to heal an ally for a large amount based on how much was spent.

The only means of attack is self-detonation, which logically takes away one unit of honeycomb each time it's used. For safety reasons, this attack is disabled when only one unit of honeycomb remains. The only way to use it harmlessly is in some scripted areas where this type of detonation is required to explode some obstructing rocks in the level.
</li><li> Sierra's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor">Betrayal at Krondor</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalInAntara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalInAntara">Betrayal in Antara</a></em> drained stamina and hitpoints to cast spells, making it tricky to judge how much power to put into it. Characters' skills start to degrade once you use up stamina (either through magic or damage from enemies), and resting outside only recovers stamina up to a certain percentage. Even the one healing spell, <em>Gift of Sung</em>, only heals at a 1:1 caster to target ratio, so even when you have two spellcasters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when you get Pug/Milamber in chapter 8 (and restore a small, small percentage of his magical ability)</span>, you can't heal everyone above the amount of health you had at the beginning of the battle. Particularly problematic is the spell "Mad Gods' Rage": it calls down a series of lightning bolts at a cost of 3 stamina/health per bolt, until either the caster dies or all enemies are dead.

Most players consider its only uses to be level grinding (it grants XP to Micaiah, who can then be healed to give XP to the healer as well), particularly after she class changes and can use a proper staff, and the fact that it heals status conditions for free.

They kill the user but fully restore any other living party member's HP. They require 1 TP to cast as well, though. Furthermore, Megid in <em>PSII</em> deals damage based on half of the life of Rolf's party members being siphoned away. The espers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarIV">Phantasy Star IV</a></em> also have the ability to extend lives at the cost of their own lifespan. This is only plot-related, though, since the aforementioned techniques don't exist in-game.
</li><li> In the not-so-renowned video game adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eragon">Eragon</a></em>, all characters have no MP whatsoever and use their HP to cast.Luckily, the "Magic" skill level of each can lower the amount of HP needed for magic.This renders healing spells slightly more useful (With low Magic skill they heal <strong>less</strong> than they cost) and is fundamental to avoid making the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> once the player has to face, solo, a pair of bosses that are immune to everything except magic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline">Phantasy Star Online</a></em>, there are weapons that sacrifice TP (technique points) for a special attack, some that drain money, as well as those that draw from your HP for a special attack. There's also a weapon that makes it so using techniques drains you HP rather than TP.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Questron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Questron">Questron</a> 2</em>, if you use the book to cast spells.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfTheWinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfTheWinds">Castle of the Winds</a></em> forces the player to draw on their own constitution when they run out of magic, lowering their max HP in order to keep decreasing mana into the negatives until the player dies. Can turn into a bit of a nail-biter when you're forced to do so, as it has a nastily unpredictable habit of suddenly killing you. Also turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Good Bad Bug</a>, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarOceanTillTheEndOfTime">Star Ocean: Till the End of Time</a></em> has a variant of this. You have separate HP and MP meters, but you are incapacitated if your HP <em>or MP</em> runs out, and some enemies deal MP damage instead of HP damage. Also, many of your special abilities, especially those belonging to nonmagical characters, cost HP instead of MP. Of course, MP in this game means Mental Points and the origin of the special abilities' power would decide what kind of fatigue the user would endure with some characters having both types. Enemies follow this rule as well and some enemies had massively low MP stats for their HP making an MP kill on them much easier than an HP kill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> has at least two powers like this; Oppressive Gloom, which keeps nearby enemies stunned while it's toggled on by draining a small amount of HP, and Energy Transfer, which was one of the most devastating single-target melee attacks in the game until it got nerfed. There's also the healing power "Absorb Pain" and later "Share Pain." The first is a Hero-only power that heals far more than any other healing power in the game. At the cost of a percent of the caster's health, and rendering them unable to recover HP in any way for several seconds. Share Pain is the Villain version of the power. It's almost identical to the Hero version in effect but rather than giving your health to the target, you take on their pain and getting a rush from it in the form of a boost to the damage you deal.
</li><li> There are some examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> games:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2</em> has an interesting variation on this. There is a series of three powers called Force Body. The first enables you to split the cost of any other Force power 50/50 between your health and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter">Mana Meter</a>. The second and third split the cost 40/40 and then 30/30, actually reducing the cost of the power in question. Given 1: Force points regenerate <em>fast</em> 2:you need to blow a turn to use it 3:After the first few levels nothing really dents your force point pool enough to warrant it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForceUnleashed">The Force Unleashed</a></em> gives the character a rechargeable "force gauge" to measure how much force powers they can freely use. If you run out, points are reduced from hit points instead. This same system is used when the characters crossover into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulCalibur">SoulCalibur</a> IV</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightJediAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediKnightJediAcademy">Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a></em> has a dark side power called Force Rage. It drains your HP, but while it's active you're literally unkillable and you hit a lot harder. Problem is, you're weaker for a while after <em>in addition</em> to having lower health. At its lowest level, it's basically a means of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToDie">Press X to Die</a>, as the health drain and post-rage weakness are at their highest and the benefits are at their lowest. (It can still be useful if an instant-kill attack is coming at you and you can't otherwise avoid it; you'll treasure that one hit-point you have.) At its highest, enjoy being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a>... and use it wisely.
</li><li> Jedi Consulars and Sith Inquisitors can convert health into force in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></em>, but doing so also lowers force regeneration for a short period.
</li></ul></li><li> A few examples from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The spells Bone Spirit and Blood Star in the original <em>Diablo</em> drain both mana and hit points when cast. Their spell icons are red to signify this.
</li><li> There's a curse that forces this on characters from <em>Diablo II</em>. Very nasty for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizards</a>, who often have less hit points than mana.
<ul><li> Specifically, the spell that does this causes one of two curses. If mana is greater than life, cast from HP curse shuts down the squishier players in short order. If life is greater than mana, however, it just causes a reduction to defense scores (the game's math is such that "defense" is rarely practical by the time this curse comes around, especially for the squishy ones). Since the effect is determined by the one creature it is cast on, rather than every creature in the effected area, teamwork tactics quickly reduce the threat this curse presents from "screwed" to "not good"
</li><li> Those are two different curses. The first only works if you have more mana than life. Otherwise, you won't ever encounter it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Paladin skill Sacrifice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a> II</em> does more damage than a regular attack at the cost of suffering 8% of the damage dealt.
</li><li> High level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancers</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> can upgrade their skills with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Runes</a>, typically resulting in a spell which is more powerful than the basic version but drains a portion of the caster's life when used (though this can be offset with equipment that bestows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life on Hit</a>).

</li></ul></li><li> Because his battery life is drained by doing <em>ANYTHING</em>, be it shooting a laser, scrubbing a stain, or just standing still, but it is also his life meter for whenever he's attacked, the title character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChibiRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChibiRobo">Chibi-Robo!</a></em> falls under this trope.

<ul><li> There are several Lunar spells that do this. Heal Other and Heal Group allow the caster to pay their own life points to restore an equal amount to allies. The Tendril abilities also do this.
</li><li> Energy Transfer allows the caster to pay life points to give their own special attack energy to an ally (who is, presumably, better at fighting than the Lunar Mage, and could put that energy to better use). Heal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">Foo</a> transfers life points on a one-to-one ratio; Energy Transfer actually consumes life points.

Side effects include insomnia, weight loss, mania/hypomania, seizures, paranoiac hallucinations, internal hemorrhaging, and cerebral deterioration, represented by a loss of hit points in-game. Of course, in the expansion they give you medics, letting you use multiple stimpacks while countering the side effects, making a squad of marines with a few medics a very formidable force.

The used life points can also be stretched by using corrupted Hypermode effectively during heated battles; once corrupted Hypermode is entered, energy from the expended tank can no longer be reclaimed, but Samus will regenerate internal Phazon energy (HP) until the Auto Vent occurs whenever entering corrupted Hypermode.

When Aya is beserked, using her weapons will sap her HP. Spells require HP to be used instead of MP, but the casting cost is doubled. While Berserk increases Aya's weapon power and levels up her parasite powers by 1, the HP cost that follows may not be worth it.

<ul><li> While not specifically magic per se, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Warrior class</a> gains skills that, in exchange for Attacking Multiple Enemy's in a Single Attack, required payment from both HP and MP — counterbalanced by the fact that these guys happen to have the highest amount of HP out of the classes in the game, hands down.
</li><li> In an inversion, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Mage class</a> gains a defensive buff that allows them to redirect up to 80% of the damage they receive to their MP.
</li><li> The Melee-based Brawler path of the Pirate class also learns a skill that converts HP into MP. The higher level the skill, the less HP you have to use to gain MP.
</li><li> The Demon Avenger plays this trope straight, literally casting from his/her own hit points — because s/he does not have an MP meter!
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AidynChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AidynChronicles">Aidyn Chronicles</a>: The First Mage</em> on the Nintendo 64, magic is cast using stamina, which along with endurance and character level determine total Hit Points.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> After a Pokémon has used all of their PP for all of their moves or is under a certain condition (Like if holding a Choice Scarf and being subject to Torment), they are forced to use an (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">otherwise unavailable</a>) move called Struggle, doing a pittance of damage at the cost of a sizable chunk of HP.
</li><li> There's the actual move Curse, where a ghost Pokémon can sacrifice half of their HP to put an extremely damaging curse status effect on the opponent that takes away a quarter of the opponent's health per turn. And has the illustration of a needle going into the ghost type. If any other type uses it, it just decreases speed, but increases attack and defense.
</li><li> Substitute, which takes 1/4 of your maximum HP and turns it into a, well, substitute that takes the damage of the next attack, as well as block status. Depending on how much health your Pokémon has and the damage the enemy does, a Substitute can sometimes take two or three hits. This gives you lots of time to set up and/or wreak havoc.
</li><li> A hold item called Life Orb boosts attacking moves by 30% at the cost of HP equal to 10% of the maximum every time you attack. The abilities Magic Guard and Sheer Force (for moves that affect it) cancels this out though. While not a direct example, Abilities such as Quick Feet, Guts, and Toxic Boost tend to invite a similar strategy. While these Abilities are activated by the user being afflicted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a>, players often speed up the process by equipping Pokémon that have said Abilities with a Toxic or Flame Orb, inflicting poison or a burn on them. This results in the Speed or Attack boost granted by the Ability, as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilityImmunity">Disability Immunity</a> against more hindering statuses like paralysis or sleep, at the cost of losing health each turn to the poison or burn.
</li><li> Some powerful moves such as Take Down, Wood Hammer, Flare Blitz, Brave Bird, Head Smash, Double-Edge, Volt Tackle, and Submission do recoil damage to the user. Some Pokemon, such as Aerodactyl and Geodude, have the ability Rock Head, which prevents recoil damage. Others have the ability Reckless, which raises the damage <em>and</em> the recoil. An interesting inversion of this is Jump Kick and Hi Jump Kick, which only damage the user if they miss, in contrast to the above moves, which damage the user when they are successful.
</li><li> Belly Drum costs half of your HP to maximize attack. It can be Baton Passed, thus making it a deadly strategy, especially if a Pokémon like Smeargle uses it.
</li><li> Some moves cause the user to faint for an effect to happen: Final Gambit subtracts whatever amount of HP they just lost from the target. Healing Wish and Lunar Dance completely heal the health and status effects of the next Pokemon to come in. Memento sharply lowers the attack and special attack stats of the opponent. Self-Destruct and Explosion (especially) are extremely powerful, but it instantly causes the user to faint. However, unlike the above, they do their damage <em>before</em> the user faints.
</li><li> In the field, Softboiled and Milk Drink can be used to restore someone else's HP, at the cost of that same amount of HP from the user.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXDGaleOfDarkness">Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</a></em> has two moves of its own. Shadow Half halves the HP of everyone on the field — yourself included. Shadow End is basically a shadow version of Double-Edge; it does massive damage, but hits you with some nasty recoil. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonColosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a></em>, Shadow Rush also does recoil damage, but not in XD.
</li><li> UB-BURST, formally known as Blacephalon, has a signature move called Mind Blown. It blows up its own head to deal a crapton of damage, then grows another and 50% of its total HP is drained, essentially acting as a slightly weaker and safer version of Explosion and Self-Destruct. Whether the regrowing of the head or the kaboom causes the damage is up for debate.
</li></ul></li><li> Blaster System of Nanoha ver. StS in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalBattleArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MagicalBattleArena">Magical Battle Arena</a></em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>, it enhanced Nanoha's capabilities, but ate at the life of both her and her device with every spell she used. This was translated in the game as a move that will significantly increase her damage at the cost of her HP being drained while it's active.

Forefoot Step is a melee attack that uses up 20% of the Dekan's health and deals out damage based on the amount of Hit Points sacrificed (and is best used with tank builds for both damage and survivability). Health To Mana sacrifices health in order to give you more mana for skills, and Health Funnel draws off some of your health in order to heal others or yourself if need be.

They don't drain health in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArcadeGame">Arcade Game</a>, only the console versions.

Using Break Arts doesn't cost MP, and doesn't increase Ashley's RISK. It does, however, take off a bit of HP. How much HP is taken varies based on the "strength" of the Break Art.

</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyofKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyofKain">Blood Omen</a></em>, Kain had a spell that allowed him to literally <em>shoot his own blood</em> at enemies. If it hit, he'd gain back any lost health plus some extra, as the enemies' blood would be sucked out of their bodies and into his. If it missed, or if he fired it at something with poisoned or tainted blood, he'd be SOL.
</li><li> In the MMORPG <em>Dark Ages</em> by Nexon, the Monk class had access to four different forms of martial arts: Draco (Dragon), Kelberoth (a large cat-like creature), Scorpion, and White Bat. One of the abilities that came with Kelberoth Form was Kelberoth Strike, which dealt a large amount of damage to an enemy at the cost of a large chunk of the Monk's HP. As a result, Kelberoth Form was generally derided as inferior, suicidal, and utterly pointless for leveling purposes unless you had a Priest attached to your hip at all times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkAgeOfCamelot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkAgeOfCamelot">Dark Age of Camelot</a></em> has a hand-to-hand class called the Savage that can buff themselves with faster and more damaging hits at the cost of losing a percentage of their current health once the effect ends.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LucentHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LucentHeart">Lucent Heart</a></em> has wizards that have a spell which converts their HP into MP. One wizard class can transfer the MP gained onto allies, making them valuable.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband">Angband</a></em>, if you cast a spell without enough mana, there's a chance of damaging your CON (health stat) temporarily or permanently. Also, the Genocide/Banishment spell will subtract 1d3 HP for each monster killed by the spell. Potions of *Healing* recommended when casting said spell in a monster pit.
</li><li> Legend Entertainment's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara">Shannara</a> (which is a videogame based on the books) has this for elfstones. "Mostly, the elfstones cannot be used twice without rest, or the user will be drained to the point of death." The elfstones themselves are also destroyed if used twice in succession. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Naturally, Davio has to die by using them twice in a battle near the end-game. (And earlier on, you can save Shella if you agree with Davio using the elfstones a second time, and Davio doesn't die, but does lose the elfstones, which instantly forfeits the game).</span> In the books, some magic works like this too: in <em>The Elfstones of Shannara</em>, Allanon's magic ages him substantially. Luckily he can recharge, which also handily explains why he's never around except when adventuring needs to be done.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms4">Wild ARMs 4</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms5">Wild ARMs 5</a></em> both have a move simply titled "Sacrifice" which uses a little MP, which brings self down to 1 HP, but deals damage proportional to it. Since all HP returns to max after battle, this is not as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> as it sounds for random encounters. Sacrifice returned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArmsXF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArmsXF">Wild ARMs XF</a></em>, attached to the main character's class. Her armor also came with the natural ability to put her to half HP instead of 1 HP.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsInTheNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsInTheNightmare">Knights in the Nightmare</a></em>, <em>any</em> action your knights and the heroines take costs some of their health (which can only be regained through leveling up). Maria and Meria both have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">finishing moves</a> that do ridiculous amounts of damage to everything on the field, but the VIT cost is so high that even three uses will kill them, meaning a game over. (Except in Easy Mode, where you can get more like seven or eight uses out of it.) Also, the "Time" and "Rounds" are essentially the life force of the Wisp:Time will always go down whenever one of your units is charging an attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em>, the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception cause brain damage, which is increasingly severe with every use. They're also quite taxing on the psyche. How drastic the damage is depends on what Shiki is trying to destroy, and merely severing alone lines does less still. The low ends of the scale is merely slicing or destroying a normally living creature. The farther end is potentially lethal and covers trying to kill objects, concepts, and properties, such as walls, the senses (theorized but never utilized), and the toxic factor in poison.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Blood Mage specialization takes this trope to the extreme. Instead of mana, a Blood Mage literally uses <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder">his own blood</a></em> (as represented by HP) to cast spells. While you have Blood Magic active, healing effects restore much less of your health than they otherwise would, which makes Blood Magic rather dangerous to use in combat if you don't know what you're doing.
</li><li> A Blood Mage can get around this by draining blood from his or her <em>own allies</em> to restore HP. Ranger summoned pets will also do in a pinch.
</li><li> Reavers are also warriors that have similar abilities.
</li><li> The Soldier's Peak DLC allows the player to unlock a few Grey Warden-specific abilities, which drain health in return for certain benefits. For example, the Dark Sustenance spell allows the Warden to sacrifice a small amount of health to gain a larger amount of mana. Warriors get an ability that weaponizes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood">High-Pressure Blood</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">blow enemies across the room</a> in all directions.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Archon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Archon">Archon</a></em>, the Wizard and the Sorceress units have pools of magic that they can use to hinder their enemies. Actually using them, however, cuts into their maximum HP when they enter combat. This can be dangerous toward the end-game, when your spellcaster may be one of the few pieces left on the board and they'll need all of the health they can muster.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a></em> has the Fusion Cannon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> which drains your shield energy if you charge it too long (and it does less damage if you do so).

That is to say, not only is Body as legitimate a stat to cast from as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mind</a> or Soul, all three function as HP of a sort, and dropping any of them to 0 counts as a defeat, so anything except a melee attack is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHP">Cast From HP</a>.
</li><li> The Life Leech from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood">Blood</a></em> normally uses trapped souls as ammunition; if you run out of those, it uses your HP as ammo instead. It's really a non-issue, considering it drains health from any enemy it hits and adds it to your own.

Additionally, if the item combined with a Pastamancer spell known as "Cannelloni Cocoon," which heals the user's full hit points for 20 MP, it wouldn't really matter how hard hitting death was. Full hit points for a fraction of the magic you just regained.

</li><li> Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em> characters themselves can't cast from hit points, wands can — a wand with nominally zero charges still has a little magic left, and with repeated zaps, it will convert its mass into enough power for one more shot, after which it disintegrates. The spinoff Slash'EM does allow casting from hit points if power points are low, and the character is at least skilled in the school of the spell in question.

Their effect is the same as another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Black Magic</a> spell, which does a huge amount of damage, but costs a lot of mana and has a long cooldown.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier2">SaGa Frontier 2</a></em>, once your characters run out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaPoints">Weapon Points or Spell Points</a>, they'll lose their Life Points (which are different from regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>.) Using skills or techniques can permanently kill the character once Life Points run out.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaGaFrontier">Sa Ga Frontier</a></em>, there's a couple spells that certain characters can get that cost Life Points to buy. Seeing as most characters only get seven or eight of these chances — and once you're out, that character is completely dead until you get to an inn that resurrects (and not all do) — you really have to weigh the pros and cons to get the spells.
</li><li> Early on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodrayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodrayne">Bloodrayne</a> 2</em>, Rayne comes across a pair of supposedly legendary anti-vampire handguns called the Carpathian Dragons. Since they process blood for ammo, you reload them by draining mooks (which you also have to do to heal yourself, so you now have to balance keeping your health and ammo topped up). The Dragons can still be fired if their reservoirs run empty, but they'll drain blood directly from Rayne — which means that each shot saps a little of your health.

</li><li> In the fourth game, Charizard sustains 5% damage to itself when using Flare Blitz. Charizard sustains an additional 5% if the move actually connects with an opponent.
</li></ul></li><li> Most games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier">Atelier</a></em> series use this system, with special attacks costing a percentage of a character's HP to use.

</li><li> Playing the Vampire race/class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DesktopDungeons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DesktopDungeons">Desktop Dungeons</a></em> causes spells to be cast from your health instead of mana.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amea">Amea</a></em> applies this by aversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> — for instance, fire spells burn your hands.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>, Servants are made of mana. Using their special techniques/Noble Phantasms uses up mana. If they use them too much, or use them when weakened or otherwise injured, then there is a risk of burning themselves out. Luckily, most Masters constantly supply their Servants with mana, and only a truly incompetent Master (*cough*Shirou*cough*) would have to rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusSexMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusSexMachina">Deus Sex Machina</a> to start the mana-transfer.
</li><li> In the BYOND game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NEStalgia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NEStalgia">NE Stalgia</a></em>, which is an online game inspired by early 8-bit RPGS, there is a warlock class which uses HP for spells. One spell, Shift, consumes health from the warlock and restores the health of another party member.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em> series, you have Health, Stamina, and Magic points. If magic is drained, you can't cast spells, no matter what. However, this trope applies to Stamina, which allows you to do anything more strenuous than day-to-day activities (like fighting, running, and so on): if Stamina runs out, you get the message that "You are so exhausted that everything you do hurts." Any subsequent use of Stamina will drain your health, and you can, in effect, exercise to death. If this happens in battle, however, you die (due to lacking sufficient energy to defend yourself).
</li><li> In the <em>The Saga of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ryzom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ryzom">Ryzom</a></em>, you can customize your attack skills and spells to do this. It's considered an economical choice.
</li><li> The Dragon's Heart attack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdventureQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdventureQuest">AdventureQuest</a></em> uses up some of your HP but heals your mana.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Flink</em>, Flink's magic and health meters are one and the same.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline">Dungeon Fighter Online</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Berserker</a> class literally uses his own blood as a weapon, to the point of dual wielding swords made from his own blood. All of his blood skills (understandably) use hit points instead of mana, and he gets buffs that allow him to drain health from enemies.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMajEyal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfMajEyal">Tales of Maj'Eyal</a></em>, Reavers and Corrupters can use the skill "Bloodcasting" to cast using HP if they can't afford the Vim cost of their skills, and "Life Tap" to boost their damage for a time at the cost of HP. The only thing that prevents all of their spells from being cast from HP all the time is that they steal the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a> of other things, and so can only regain Vim by attacking creatures.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII">Star Control II</a></em>, a ship's crew functions as its hitpoints. The Orz can send crew members into space to board the enemy ship, while the Druge can sacrifice crew members in order to fire their giant cannon more. The Ur-Quan could launch fighters crewed from their own crew complement — more nimble than Orz marines, and against the right targets, more reliable — but they only had a hitpoint each, and since they needed to stay in space to do their work (unlike the Orz), they were rendered utterly useless by enemy point defense. Launching fighters against a Chmrr Avatar was about as useful as flushing your crew down the drain, unless its orbiting zap-sats had all been destroyed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Amagon">Amagon</a></em>: The most powerful attack in the game is a laser that Megagon can shoot from his body, at the cost of two hit points.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Athena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Athena">Athena</a></em>, Athena loses one hit point each time she swings the powerful Flame Sword. This can't kill her, because the sword powers down when she gets low on health.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>, a few characters' arts fall into this category.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom">Tatsunoko vs. Capcom</a></em> has Baroque mode, which to execute you must be willing to give up red health (meaning health that can be healed on the sidelines). However, the more punishment you take means the more health you can exchange to power up, and that means the stronger you'll be under its influence.

Each character has a special technique that burns HP, but the HP used to fuel the attack is marked in blue on their life meter instead of the normal red. When the character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegeneratingHealth">Regenerating Health</a> kicks in, they're able to heal the section marked in blue without draining their Soul Limit (which would happen for the red.) If they get hit before the blue section is fully healed, though, it turns red and becomes normal damage that does require draining the Soul Limit meter to replenish.
</li><li> <em>Corruption of Champions</em> has two sets of magic armor — the Inquisitor's Robes and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> the Inquisitor's Corset — that, when worn, change the spellcasting mechanics by using HP instead of Fatigue points to cast spells and activate mental and supernatural specials. These armors can only be found in the swamp and take a ridiculous amount of searching to find, and you can't obtain both sets with the same character, but for a mage or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>, they're considered the best light armor sets in the game. It would definitely be worth your time to search the swamp until you find them if using magic figures heavily into your core skill set, especially if you have a high Toughness score and all of the Tank and Regeneration perks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesRise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesRise">Heroes Rise</a></em>, the plffayer has two separate meters for power and health, but can drain one to fill the other.

The Neo Tri Beam in <em>3</em> has two different versions: if done correctly, it drains very little from Tien, but if done <em>in</em>correctly, he replays the end of the Cell battle and collapses, most of his health gone.
</li><li> In the second <em>Budokai</em>, there's a special mode which acts as a regular versus match, with the only difference being that your health and ki bar are merged together.

<ul><li> This is common for the Warlock class. Their Hero Power sacrifices 2 HP to draw a card.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> Valkyr's Paralysis is a partial example; it still takes energy to cast, albeit a minuscule amount, but the main cost is a third of her shields.

</li><li> Nekros's ability Desecrate can be converted to this with the Augment mod Despoil. Since Desecrate causes enemy corpses to drop more loot with increased chances for health orbs, it usually ends up paying for itself.
</li><li> Inaros's ultimate ability, Scarab Swarm, drains his health in exchange for a proportional increase in armor. Since he has the highest health of all Warframes by a significant margin, and he has plenty of ways to regain lost health, he can easily afford it. Unlike most instances of this trope, he can actually reclaim the lost health if the buff is dispelled prematurely. He can also choose to willingly sacrifice some of the extra armor to infest an enemy with scarabs, draining their health for him, but he'll have to give up some more health to charge the power back up again.
</li><li> Garuda's third ability converts half of her current health into energy, allowing her to power all of her other abilities with her health.

</li><li> The Razor Blade and Blood Rights are items that deal damage to Isaac in exchange for a temporary damage boost/room-wide damage burst, respectively. These are usually considered poor, but can be good if you want to lower your red hearts without losing soul hearts, such as if you are playing as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalStatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalStatusBuff">Eve</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Samson</a>.

It can be used in two forms, a keystone that means the player no longer has mana at all and uses all abilities like this, or as a support that causes only the supported skills to use life instead of mana (but they generally cost more life than they would have cost mana). There are also a few spells that do this by default: righteous fire burns the player as well as their enemies, dark pact will consume the player's health unless they have skeleton minions to draw from instead, and blood offering takes a percentage of the player's life and grants minions regeneration based on the amount.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em>, those who use their magic without being connected to the Heart of Candracar end up using up their own life energy doing so. Halinor is shown to be exhausted after using some of her magic to protect the Citadel and it's implied that Nerissa's withered state is because of her constantly using Quintessence.
</li><li> Elita One, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a> episode <em>The Search For Alpha Trion</em>, had the power to stop time at a localized level, but doing so drained her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>, Princess Cadence uses her own lifeforce to power the magical shield protecting the Crystal Empire. In a very similar move, her husband Shining Armor uses his own lifeforce to also power the shield protecting Canterlot from the Changelings.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>, there is a somewhat literal example: Aelita has the power to manipulate the environment of Lyoko, mainly creating new features, but using this power costs her half her life points.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, Transformers have a fail-safe mode called "stasis lock" that forces them to shut down temporarily if low on power or heavily damaged. In the episode "Code of Hero", when Dinobot ends up having to stand against <em>all of the Predacons by himself</em>, he has to override this safety feature in order to keep fighting. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dinobot uses his last bit of energy to destroy the Golden Disk that contained a record of future events, costing Megatron one of his biggest advantages and saving the future of the human race.</span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Computer</strong>: <span class="asscaps">Warning. Power reserves 96% depleted.

It can protect him and those standing near him, but the energy drain on him is enormous, so he can only maintain it briefly and is left exhausted afterward.
