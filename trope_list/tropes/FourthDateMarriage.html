</li><li> <em>Goldfish Memory</em> features one couple meeting, getting together and planning a family in less time then it takes one partner to realise she's already pregnant from a one-night stand just before they met. Multiple other couples manage to meet, break up, get engaged, and all manner of other things in the same period.
<ul><li> Notably, one character romances two women, the women themselves get together and then break up, and go on to new relationships. Meanwhile, the man has met a third woman, who's subverted his usual methods (including a spiel which is (a) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">incorrect</a> and (b) the source of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>) six ways from Sunday. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastGirlWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastGirlWins">Last Girl Wins</a>.

The second couple <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">falls in love within a matter of weeks, but doesn't marry until a year later.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Made Of Honor</em> (the gender-swapped <em>My Best Friend's Wedding</em>), Hannah hooks up with Colin, a guy she meets in Scotland on a business trip. They get engaged at <em>most</em> five weeks later, to be wed a fortnight onward. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She realizes on the eve of the wedding that she has no idea who he is and breaks off the engagement by making out with the titular flirty-best-friend of ten years and Man of Honor in the middle of the ceremony</span>

</li><li> Charles is quick on his decision in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLadyEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLadyEve">The Lady Eve</a></em>. He proposes to Jean after a couple of dates on the boat. Later he proposes to Eve after seeing her for a couple of weeks.
</li><li> Inverted in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">Stargate</a></em> movie. Daniel Jackson is given Sha'uri as a gift, but it isn't until a day or so later that he even <em>realizes</em> that they're already married. By the end of the movie, he's fallen in love and decided to stay on Abydos with her.
<ul><li> Further justified in that staying on Abydos would have been his dream come true even <em>without</em> a beautiful woman involved, since he's an archaeologist with a ruined career and no family to go back to.

</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhileYouWereSleeping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhileYouWereSleeping">While You Were Sleeping</a></em>, in which Peter dramatically proposes to Lucy despite having properly met her twice, and plans to get married to her what would appear to be a few days later, because he thinks they're <em>already</em> engaged and he merely has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> about her (they weren't and he hasn't, but thinks he does due to a rather tangled series of events).

</li><li> Kind of the whole point of <em>Designing Woman</em> (not to be confused with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesigningWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DesigningWomen">Designing Women</a></em>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregoryPeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregoryPeck">Gregory Peck</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenBacall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenBacall">Lauren Bacall</a> meet and marry after a few days, and hijinks ensue once they realize how different they are. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It works out OK in the end.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhenInRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhenInRome">When in Rome</a></em> starts out at the wedding of the protagonist's sister. Whilst she and the best man are dancing, they both admit they don't think it'll last 'cause the couple have known each other for <em>two weeks</em>.
</li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually">Love Actually</a></em> is set during the month before Christmas, with a month-long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> near the end, so this happens in a couple of the subplots:
<ul><li> Jamie proposes to Aurelia despite knowing her for roughly a month and not even speaking the same language. Note that he was living with another woman (who cheated on him with his brother) just before meeting her.
</li><li> John and Judy are also married at the end. While they seem to have known each other for a while, their relationship was only about a month old.
</li><li> In a variant, Daniel and Carol are only dating at the end, having met a month earlier on Christmas Eve... but that meeting came only a month after Daniel's wife died. Kind of rushing it, don't you think?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HellFighters">Hell Fighters</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnWayne">John Wayne</a> homage to Oil Well firefigther Red Adair, has him as Chance Buckman, the best oil well fire fighter in the world, who has as his best employee Greg Parker, a man who's found a sure-fire method to get women he meets to go to bed with him: he brings them to the fire. When Chance is critically injured in an accident, his friend tells Greg to go get Chance's previously unknown daughter Tish (who was living with her mother) so she can see him in case he dies. Chance is still under anaesthesia when their office gets called that a fire has broken out. It's money, so everyone goes, except Tish, who wants to go, but everyone in the company (including Greg) who knows about Greg's womanizing, realize it wouldn't be a good idea if Chance found out that Greg took his daughter to a fire. She then shows up on her own anyway. When she goes back to see her father when he wakes up from anaesthesia after surgery, she innocently tells her father that she went to a fire with Greg. Chance calls Greg into the hospital room and cold cocks him for taking his daughter to a fire, only to discover that almost immediately after they met at the fire, Greg and Tish got married.
</li><li> This turns out to be the twist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveHundredDaysOfSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveHundredDaysOfSummer">(500) Days of Summer</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Summer breaks up with Tom and marries another man several months later.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic (1997)</a></em>, right before the ship hits the iceberg, Rose tells Jack that when the ship docks, she's getting off with him. Somewhat justified, as transatlantic cruises such as the <em>Titanic</em> and her sister ship <em>Olympic</em> were known for people meeting and falling in love during the six or so day voyage; the only unrealistic bit is this happening between people of different social classes. Also, she's desperately unhappy, and looking for <em>any</em> way to get away from Hockley - she was about to <em>kill</em> herself earlier, it's no surprise she'd grab onto Jack like that. And of course, we don't know how it would have turned out long-term anyway.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenChances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SevenChances">Seven Chances</a></em>, where the hero, being single, is required to be married the same day by 7 p.m. in order to get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedInheritance">Unexpected Inheritance</a> of Seven million dollars.

</li><li> In the 2016 Chinese film <em>Mermaid</em>, Xuan proposes to Shan on the second day they meet. Shan incredulously replies that this is coming far too soon, but Xuan insists that this qualifies as going <em>slow</em> for him because he spent an entire night agonizing over the decision instead of following his impulses right away. It ends up taking quite a bit longer for them to marry.

Their "dates" include, Robin getting into a bidding war with Batman over her after just meeting her, him being seduced by her at Freeze's lair when he was supposed to arrest her and attacking Batman for thinking he's jealous of their love, and meeting Ivy alone in her lair where they finally share their first kiss together. When Robin meets with Ivy in her lair, just their third meeting together and a few days after their initial meeting, he tells her he "wants for them to be together," implying he already wants to marry her. However, this is all justified by Ivy using her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsInTheAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsInTheAir">pheromone dust</a> on Robin, which quickly turned his crush on her into blind love and made him make a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb">stupid decisions</a> under the belief that she loves him.

He also expects that being with her will get rid of his trauma of being a POW of the Japanese. His losing money all the time as well as his anger and PTSD makes things so bad that she wants to get a divorce even though they just had a child. But then Cynthia goes to a Billy Graham crusade, and convinces Louis to go, and he ends up realizing that God never abandoned, and not only does this restore his faith, but it also gets rid of his alcoholism and PTSD. This really did happen in real life, and can be read about in the book. The first movie doesn't cover it, but the second movie does. In short, it's at first played straight, then it gets subverted, and then played straight again, as after that they had another child, and remained married until 2001, when Cynthia died.

When she returns to the village a few months later, Tao asks her again and this time she agrees.

</li></ul></li><li> Don't forget Matt and Sarah's first date marriage on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em>, though they did have a big wedding several months later.
</li><li> Charles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em> has a strong tendency for this kind of relationship. It even has a name: "Full Boyle mode". It's been a great disservice for him in the past, but it works out with his two main love interests because they're the same kind of people.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVicarOfDibley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVicarOfDibley">The Vicar of Dibley</a></em>.

If you want to be technical, they got married while <em>on</em> their first date!
<ul><li> Dharma seems to think they knew each other in a past life or something, though. Plus the cute little kiddy prologue. Not that either really makes the situation <em>saner</em>...

Eventually, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they have arguments over signing the pre-nups and realize they can't trust each others.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Kind of played with in a Venezuelan telenovela. The mismatched couple of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellExcuseMePrincess">pampered architect</a> and a construction worker meet and fall in love with passion and true honesty, then get a quick marriage using the looophole of "legalizing" a long concubinary relationship, although they have known each other less than a month, so she can get away from her family. Unfortunately they get in an accident which not only separates them, but also gives her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyAmnesia">Easy Amnesia</a> and puts her in the custody of a millionaire who finds her. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> ensues when she falls in love with this second man, and then her husband (now a rich man) finally finds her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoahsArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NoahsArc">Noah's Arc</a></em>: Fourth date is an exaggeration, but its revealed early on that Chance and Eddie have only known each other for six months at the start of the series, considering marriage (and get married very soon into the series) and are moving in together. This is also notable for being portayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthDateMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthDateMarriage">Fourth Date Marriage</a> in-universe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em> has "The Wedding of Sarah Jane", where the title character is about to marry a man she's known for at best a few months, and a single episode.
</li><li> A literal example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em>: a heart patient is brought in at Thanksgiving and told she has to hold on until the New Year, when she has a good chance of receiving a donor heart. Her very new boyfriend remains by her bedside for weeks, and proposes when they hear a heart has been found. She points out that they have had only four dates, then says yes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HerculesTheLegendaryJourneys">Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</a></em>, Hercules meets his love Serena in one episode and the two share a kiss by the end of that episode. By the middle of the very next episode he proposes marriage to her and marries her in same episode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyNameIsEarl">My Name Is Earl</a></em>, Earl is playing pool at the Crab Shack with his brother. Not far away, looking at them, is a pregnant Joy and her two friends. She's telling them how she got thrown out of her parents' house because of her premarital pregnancy, and how she needs to find a husband to provide for her and the kid ASAP. The women scope out the men at the bar, initially choosing Randy, but Joy rejects him because he's rather a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Cloud Cuckoolander</a>. She is, however, attracted to Earl, but she knows most men won't marry a woman who's six months pregnant with another man's baby. So she enlists her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlPosse">Girl Posse</a> to get him drunk, which they do, and she introduces herself to Earl. Joy drives him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas">Las Vegas</a>, where they have a quickie-wedding.
<ul><li> Funny thing is, the final episode (before the cancellation) reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the boy actually <em>is</em> Earl's (they hooked up for a one-night stand at a costume party and didn't see each other's faces)</span>, so in a weird kind of way he ends up making an "honest" woman out of her (if that word can even be applied to Joy).
</li><li> Earl's other two marriages were an example of this trope as well. His second marriage was to his friend Ralph's elderly mother, after it was revealed that Earl drunkenly slept with her some years back and Ralph was threatening Earl's life over it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The marriage was annulled within two weeks, because Earl wouldn't consummate the marriage and she slept with the old man in Earl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageBand">Garage Band</a>.</span> His third marriage was to his friend Frank's ex-girlfriend Billie, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">a coma dream convinced Earl that she was The One</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em>, each episode takes place over the course of about 24 hours, and each one follows right after the other with a two-week time skip at the end of Season 1. This means that Bill and Sookie have sex for the first time about a week after meeting. Then, when Bill proposes to Sookie at the end of Season 2, they had known each other for a total of 43 days. Since Bill was born in the 19th century this may have been his expectation from the start.
</li><li> Often seen in soap operas, most notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldAndTheBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoldAndTheBeautiful">The Bold and the Beautiful</a></em>, which will have characters planning a wedding within a month of meeting.
</li><li> The first scene of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArmyWives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArmyWives">Army Wives</a> has Trevor propose to Roxy having dated her for four <em>days</em>. They marry shortly after that.

</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>, April and Andy decide to get married out of the blue after a season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> and about a month of actual dating. Played with in that Leslie spends a whole episode trying to convince them how wrong their decision must be and that they're rushing into it, and finally realizes that maybe she should just give them a chance and let them do what they want. April and Andy do indeed get married, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">it actually works out!</a> Their relationship is remarkably stable, given how immature they both are in all other aspects.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>, Abed attempts to invoke this trope with Jeff and Britta. He has a wedding party with a best man and musical performers standing by just in case.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyFamily">My Family</a></em>, a psychic tells Janey she will meet her true love at a wedding she's due to attend.

</li><li> In the classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek</a></em> episode "For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky," the female alien leader is totally ready to marry McCoy after spending a few hours with him (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even though he's dying of a rare disease</span>), but then for her it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, we're made to think that it's customary for Klingons to marry after having sex for the first time, as Worf tries to shout the traditional wedding oath after sleeping with K'Ehleyr, who, being half-human, isn't about to make a lifelong commitment after a single night together. We don't really see it in later pairings involving Klingons.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinOfSherwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinOfSherwood">Robin of Sherwood</a></em>, Robin and Marian meet while Robin is trying to escape from the Sheriff of Nottingham (Marian is his ward).

</li><li> There's parallels to this with the early habit of having female companions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> by having the Doctor leave them in some godforsaken time period because they've fallen in love with someone. Susan's relationship with David is implied to take place over the course of several months, but Vicki's relationship with Troilus explicitly takes place over the course of two days and is still intense enough that she abandons her life of adventure and her adoptive grandfather in order to live in a time period before modern medicine (when "The Web Planet" had established she was disturbed even by the idea of swallowing aspirin tablets due to how primitive it was) and knowing that there is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> there who detests her to the point she's tried to have her killed.
</li><li> The other notorious example is "The Invasion of Time", where Leela suddenly announces she's marrying Andred after barely even showing any sexual tension with him and only knowing him for a couple of days at most. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>, as the showrunners deliberately failed to write a convincing exit for her because they were hoping until the last minute that the actor would change her mind about leaving.

The Prince of Verona publicly calls the Montagues and Capulets out on this at the end of the play.
<ul><li> Played somewhat straighter in the musical adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WestSideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WestSideStory">West Side Story</a></em>, though with a similar message at the end.
</li></ul></li><li> Like everything else, played with <em>and</em> played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AMidSummerNightsDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AMidSummerNightsDream">A Mid Summer Nights Dream</a></em>: Demetrius's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a> with Helena half-way through the play is brought about by a literal plot device, the love potion; nonetheless, it sticks, and they are ready to be married by the end of the play.
<ul><li> The play does hint that Demetrius and Helena had a relationship before he started pursuing Hermia, which explains why Helena is so convinced that he really loves her. It still has him thrown back into love with her, though.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em>, it's unclear exactly how much time passes between Eliza and Alexander meeting and them deciding to get married, but the song seems to imply it happens only over the course of a few weeks. This is a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> and artistic license: the real Eliza and Alexander did <em>want</em> to get married after only knowing one another for a month, which was a pretty normal timeframe during that period (sex outside of marriage was frowned upon and most couples didn't want to wait long). However, they weren't able to get married at that time because Eliza's parents wouldn't have been able to be there, and since Angelica had already eloped, they really wanted to be present for Eliza's wedding. (Notably, Eliza was the only one of her father's children who had his blessing for marriage.) As a result, given Hamilton's army commitments, it was a full six months before they actually married.

</li><li> Possible in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims">The Sims</a></em>. Heck, it's possible to have a <em>first-date</em> marriage, if you're determined enough to raise enough relationship in that first day. Justified in all games after the first as those include lifespans and ageing mechanics, with time advancing at very high speed - each "day" is representative of several months (roughly a year per day in <em>The Sims 2</em>, judging from the day age meter without mods), resulting in solid dating history before marriage happens.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em> has no way of showing the passage of time in most of the main campaign, but it seems like it takes place over maybe a month. And in the space of a month, you can get an elf (notoriously patient species) for males or a paladin (very cautious about this sort of thing) for females to be declaring undying love for you by the end. Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Elanee</a> actually makes more sense than most examples, and being thrown into a waterfall of life-or-death situations would tend to make romantic involvement progress rather quickly.
<ul><li> <em>Mask of the Betrayer</em> takes place over around three weeks, given its internal traveling time estimates. Then again, both of the possible love interests have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReincarnationRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReincarnationRomance">decent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadykillerInLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadykillerInLove">excuse</a>.
</li><li> It is ambiguous how long you spend wandering around the Underdark with Nathyrra (or Valen if your character is female), but somehow it doesn't seem long enough for what results. The timeframe for the player character and either Aribeth or Arin (depending on gender) in the original campaign is a lot more feasible.
</li><li> This trope quite frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Diana</a> on her romance path in the community module <em>Sanctum of the Archmage</em>, which combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveBeforeFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveBeforeFirstSight">Love Before First Sight</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified for a male player character and Bastila in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em>, due to their force bond. Less so for a female player character and Carth.
<ul><li> It's possibly averted. It's not really clear how long the quest for the star maps takes.
</li></ul></li><li> Potentially averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, as the events of the Blight take place over roughly a year. This allows the Warden to make a move immediately, or spend fairly good span of time to develop their relationship with Alistair/Morrigan/Leliana/Zevran. The characters each take a different span of time to fall in love, even if their approval is very high; "love" requires their personal quest to be completed, which for Alistair <em>could</em> be done the first time you enter Denerim, but for Zevran requires the Landsmeet to have been called, approaching end-game.
<ul><li> Completely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>. The events of the game take place over ten years, and it takes three for Hawke's relationship with his/her chosen significant other to move to a physical level. The end of the game takes place ten years after the beginning, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hawke's love interest is the sole companion to remain by his/her side after the events of the endgame.</span>
<ul><li> Practically inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>'s case, considering how little changes for most characters in the course of what's supposed to be that many years.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em>. The romance dialogues (which there are about 20 for each option) happen roughly every half hour or so in realtime. In game time this usually translates in more than three months.
</li><li> You can invoke this in certain <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarvestMoon">Harvest Moon</a></em> games due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">Good Bad Bugs</a>. Arguably, a lot of <em>Harvest Moon</em> games feature this unless you believe all events involving you two romantically are dates.
<ul><li> If one figures out what items the various love interests like, it can be ridiculously easy to get them to love you in very short periods of time, with minimal interaction.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasonsTrioOfTowns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StoryOfSeasonsTrioOfTowns">Story of Seasons: Trio of Towns</a></em>, the DLC candidates Stephanie and Woofio are unusual in they completely skip dating and are married during their final (and coincidentally fourth) love event. While the player can choose to stay friends with them in the last event instead of marrying them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">this will lock them out of being married again for the file</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">This can be taken even further</a> taking advantage of their special items and other friendship boosts, allowing a player to marry them in less than a <em>full in-game season</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em>, all that's required for marriage is having completed a quest for a given (and marriageable) NPC and then speaking to them while wearing an amulet that signifies you're available and looking. Some require you complete whole questlines, which presumably would give you time to get to know each other (not much, but some time) while others require only a simple fetch quest, and some require only that you beat your potential spouse in a bare-knuckle brawl. The priest of Mara who explains this to you points out that this is not unusual at all in Skyrim, as, well, it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">freaking</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">Skyrim</a></em>, one of the most dangerous regions in the world, and people don't involve themselves in long courtships when death is literally right down the road.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> has <em>many</em> examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemJugdral">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> doesn't do this in gameplay; it takes a buildup 500 love points for two characters to marry and the chapters explicitly span months or years. Plotwise, however, Deirdre and Sigurd take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a> to a new level. After she hears about him from Aideen and he saves her from a ruffian, they part ways for a few turns (i.e. a few days at best, depending on your interpretation of ingame time) and wind up saying things like "I tried so hard to forget you!" to each other as though they were lovers separated for months, rather than strangers who ran into each other for ten minutes.
</li><li> Can be played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> if Chrom marries the Female Avatar (a girl whom he meets by the start of the story - it's not clear how many days/weeks pass from the beginning to the chapter where Chrom marries her or any other of his brides) or Olivia (who appears <em>at the same chapter where he has to get married</em>).
<ul><li> If a male Avatar marries Chrom's sister Lissa quite early in the story, it can be the same deal.
</li><li> It's possible for nearly all first-generation characters to marry someone they've just met, if the player grinds their supports quickly enough. And invoking the trope name more literally, the fourth support level, S, is the one where the characters get married. Who knew constantly fighting for your life together on a battlefield could be so romantic?
</li><li> Hell, the way the support system works, there are a lot of pairing conversations that seem to involve a <em>zero</em> date marriage: each pairing has a C, B, and A support conversation which are all platonic (though possessing varying degrees of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> on a case-by-case basis), and then an S support which is explicitly romantic. Only the final conversation can be explicitly romantic because only these conversations are blocked after a character gets married, to prevent polyamory. This means that for each pairing, the characters only get the space of a single conversation to go from admitting their romantic feelings to proposing marriage, sometimes all in one smooth action!
</li></ul></li><li> The trend continues in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, particularly in the <em>Revelation</em> route if the player decides to pair off characters from Hoshido with characters from Nohr. Azura even comments on this trope in her S-level support with Niles.
<div class="indent"><strong>Azura:</strong> Niles, I do have feelings for you, but we've barely managed to discuss the weather!
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneFactory4">Rune Factory 4</a></em>, you can have a <em>third</em> date marriage — while it can take more than that, the base requirements to get hitched are to have a double bed, an engagement ring, and three dates with your lover. In fact, if you're playing as a female, you don't even need the ring; your boyfriend will propose to <em>you</em> after a minimum of three dates. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">You can turn him down, though, and propose later. Presumably after going on a few more dates</a>. However, this trope can also be potentially subverted by the way time passes in the game, as depending on how much you speed through days, it's possible to have only gone on only three dates but have been romantically involved with your eventual spouse for <em>years</em>.

<h3>Cultural examples</h3>
<ul><li> Cultures which practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> sometimes have the bride and groom meeting just a few times before their wedding. Since the ones responsible for arranging the wedding are the parents, the couple technically do not have a reason to meet until the wedding. Doubly so if the families are too poor (or on the opposite end, too aristocratic) and live far away from each other. Do note that arranged =/= forced. There is a reason such meetings exist. Most couples still need to okay the proposal before the wedding can proceed. If they say no, the parents search for a potential spouse again. Rinse and repeat.
</li><li> Many religions disapprove of premarital sex, and so this is common among stricter adherents of multiple religions.
<ul><li> Traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islamic</a> customs dictate that people who want to marry must do so as early as possible. Casual dating is not strictly forbidden, but it is frowned upon, mainly due to a fear that the couples might be inclined to perform fornication (which is forbidden in Islam). To get around this idea, some have a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikah_mut%27ah">mut'ah<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a temporary marriage, somewhat invoking this.
</li><li> Happens a lot in the Ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jewish community—many become engaged after a grand total of ONE half-hour date at home, or beshow. Before that their parents do a lot of research and... that's basically it, besides the family pointing the guy out to the girl in synagogue. While it's an arranged marriage in a sense, it's not a forced marriage. It does seem to work.
<ul><li> In non-Hassidic Orthodox Jewish communities, it's more of a blind dating construct, but engagements are still pushed after fewer than ten dates, which can be compressed into a period of about a month. Longer than that is discouraged. Unlike Hassidim, however, who generally tend to have long engagements, non-Hassidim generally get married VERY soon after engagement (a month or two).
</li></ul></li><li> Among some conservative and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">fundamentalist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Christian</a> sects, dating and long engagements are discouraged because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvilAndIAmHorny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvilAndIAmHorny">the temptation to have sex before the wedding</a>. Young people (on the advice of St. Paul, who advised people who couldn't handle celibacy to go and get married so as to avoid temptation) might rush to the altar so that they can have sex and still be seen as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureAdoresAVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureAdoresAVirgin">pure</a>." Sometimes this is encouraged by their families, especially in situations where instead of dating, the couple "courts"—that is, goes on a few parent-supervised "dates", with the understanding that the end goal is marriage, and the couple is expected to make their decision ASAP.
</li><li> Relationships among college-age <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Mormons</a> usually seem to start within a week of the two meeting each other for the first time, and within the next month or two they've either broken up or gotten engaged (and Mormons tend to have their weddings pretty quick after being engaged, too).
</li></ul></li><li> In the gay community there is a joke of "Lesbian U-Haul Syndrome," in which a lesbian couple will move in together very early in a relationship, leading to many of the same problems. The idea is that since men are stereotypically the ones with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommitmentIssues">Commitment Issues</a>, if you remove them from the situation then it's full steam ahead.
<div class="indent"> What do lesbians do on the second date? Get engaged. What do lesbians do on the third date? Get married. What do they do on the fourth date? Set up home together.
</div></li><li> Not uncommon for those who find love in their senior years of life to marry their sweethearts within a short time of meeting them.
</li><li> In the 1950s, if you were dating someone for longer than a few months without getting married, it was usually considered improper, as they were "trying to have it all."
</li><li> A common event in the military, at least in the United States. It is not uncommon to see young couples get married to someone that they can tolerate in order to receive better living conditions (single soldiers are quartered in a barracks, where they will often share communal living and bathroom facilities with upwards of 30 other people, while married personnel receive apartments or houses for them and their families) and better pay (married soldiers will get extra money if separated from their families for an extended period, alongside the added financial benefits that come with marriage such as filing joint taxes and reduced insurance costs).
<ul><li> Plus, if you know you're about to be deployed, it makes sense to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltarTheSpeed">Altar the Speed</a> in case you don't make it back. The widow of a service-member killed in action gets $100,000 plus a pension of 1.375% of his high-3 pay times the number of years he served. His fiancee, on the other hand, gets nothing, even if he left her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeoneToRememberHimBy">Someone to Remember Him By</a>.
</li><li> Has been used by couples who are both in the service with one soon to be deployed overseas to a peaceful location as a way to increase the odds of their new spouse likewise getting an assignment in that country. In at least one case of this, the marriage was the first date, and may have never been consummated.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CherylCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CherylCole">Cheryl Cole</a> dated her second husband, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, for three months before marrying him in 2014. However, they eventually separated after 19 months, and tabloid reports tend to vary on the details of the separation.
</li><li> A very heartwarming example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CateBlanchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CateBlanchett">Cate Blanchett</a>: Cate and her husband Andrew Upton (who is a screenwriter and playwright) got engaged after they'd only been dating for about three weeks. They've been married since 1997 and have four children together, proving that whirlwind romances do sometimes last.
</li><li> Greg Mortensen explains in his biography <em>Three Cups of Tea</em>, that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a> when he met his wife Tara at a party in 1995. So much so, that they got married <em>six days later</em>. And theyre STILL together, despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie">controversy that's popped up about his book</a>.
</li><li> Like Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArianaGrande" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArianaGrande">Ariana Grande</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>'s Pete Davidson got engaged just one month into dating, much to the surprise of everyone; they have since broken up.
</li><li> Played straight in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyBonaduce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyBonaduce">Danny Bonaduce</a>'s case, who revealed that he and ex-wife Gretchen married after their <em>first</em> date, the marriage lasted 16 years and two kids before they got divorced in 2007.
</li><li> Same with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheNotoriousBIG">The Notorious B.I.G.</a> and Faith Evans, they got married just <em>nine</em> days into dating and stayed together until his murder in 1997.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulBettany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulBettany">Paul Bettany</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferConnelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferConnelly">Jennifer Connelly</a> got engaged without having even gone on <em>one</em> date. They'd met and befriended one another while filming <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABeautifulMind">A Beautiful Mind</a></em>, and kept in phone contact afterward. When 9/11 happened, he spent hours trying to get ahold of her; once she'd assured him she was okay, he said, "Let's get married." 17 years later, they're still together.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1folj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1folj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1folj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As if their relationship wasn't enough like a movie already, she was his first teenage crush.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrocodileHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrocodileHunter">Steve Irwin</a> proposed to Terri Raines on their fourth encounter, only four months after they met by chance and fell in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a> at his parents' reptile park. The wedding was four months after that. They remained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> and very passionately in love for 14 years, until Steve's death in 2006.
