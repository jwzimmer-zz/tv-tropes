Good at everything, the best at nothing. Their biggest strength is their lack of any glaring weaknesses, and their biggest weakness is their lack of any remarkable strengths.
</p><p>This character is the baseline to get the hang of the controls; this character lacks the extremes that might trip up a novice. It is also a solid choice for advanced players who want the flexibility to exploit an enemy's weakness, no matter what that may be. Whether the character retains their usefulness as the player's skill grows depends on how much the game rewards versatility as opposed to pure power, but the Jack-of-All-Stats is almost never the best character in any given game or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. They may have trouble dealing with characters whose skills are more extreme than theirs if they're allowed to press their advantages. Some games tout the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillGateCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillGateCharacter">great for beginners,</a> while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">for experts only</a>. In other games, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertiaIsACruelMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertiaIsACruelMistress">tough to control</a> while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> is easier to handle. In either case, the Jack-of-All-Stats is an all-around safe bet for anyone.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In games with multiple playable races, it is often the case that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage">Humans Are Average</a> and are therefore the Jack-of-All-Stats race. It's common for humans to be a compromise, stat-wise, between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVsDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVsDwarves">classic dichotomy</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">elves</a>, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">graceful and fragile</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarves</a>, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">strong and slow</a>.
</p><p>Another strength that helps the Jack-of-All-Stats is resistance to changes brought about by patches or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metagame">Metagame</a> discoveries that would reduce or remove the need for a specialist class. Also, the Jack-of-All-Stats can, and will, become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Master of All</a> if given enough time and effort which, unfortunately, is always expensive in comparison to a specialist class. Their versatility also overlaps in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a>, as such characters tend to be unpredictable when it comes to gameplay and strategy.
</p><p>But either way, they can also fall into their own category of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> due to the fact that because they're so balanced, they lack specialization. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">This in theory would mean more specialized characters can fall back on one thing the balanced ones can also do, only on a much more effective scale. This would mean this archetype have to rely on a lot more work to do well against said specialists, or even against themselves with a lot of fundamentals or out-of-the-box tactics</a>. On the other hand, some of these characters can fall into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillGateCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkillGateCharacter">Skill Gate Character</a> since their versatility allows newer players to explore different gameplay styles as well as exploring the player's strengths and weaknesses.

<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a> is the Jack-of-All-Stats in nearly every game he appears in that features some form of competitive balance. This is so common with Mario that he's the former trope namer for this kind of character.
<p></p><ul><li> Mario's balanced nature was codified by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros2">Super Mario Bros. 2</a></em>. Luigi can jump the highest, Toad is the fastest at running and picking up items, and Peach can hover for short periods after jumping. However, Luigi is difficult to control precisely, Toad's jumping is awful, and Peach is exceptionally slow at picking up items. On the other hand, Mario is the second best jumper behind Luigi, the second fastest at picking up items and moving behind Toad, and his controls are very precise. He retains this pattern for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario3DWorld">Super Mario 3D World</a></em>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart">Mario Kart</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Mario is the Jack-of-All-Stats, as seen on the page image. While his stats are never exactly average across the board, he doesn't have any glaring strengths or weaknesses. Mario has decent acceleration, weight, handling, and top speed, without being exceptional in any area.
</li><li> In <em>Mario Kart</em> games where the drivers and the karts can be selected separately, Mario's kart also has stats that boil down to "good but not great at everything", much like the man himself. Among all 36 karts available in the game, Mario's kart's stats are the most balanced and closest to the middle.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>, Mario is the only one who can flip, so that most of the game has to be played through him. Bowser is the strongest attacker and has flame breath, Peach has a big shield when crouching and can float down slowly with her parasol, and Luigi jumps higher along with an additional super jump ability. At the same time, Bowser <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">is a bigger target, moves slower, and can't jump very high</a>, Peach's parasol can't be used for defense while she's moving, and Luigi has lower traction. Mario has decent speed, attack, and jumping, but isn't the best at anything.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em> series, Mario has decent mobility, average weight, mid-range damage, and mid-range launch power. His special moves and combos are quite varied, but none of them are as good as other characters' similar moves. And while his attacks aren't very flashy, they're also straightforward with no extra gimmicks to them, which makes Mario not need to worry about resource management like some other fighters do.
</li><li> The DS version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> adds three new characters with different abilities. Yoshi can't punch and has his characteristic flutter jump, Wario is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>, and Luigi jumps higher, again. Mario stays the same as always. His land speed does seem to be the highest of the four, though it's not reflected in the manual which gives him two stars out of a possible three for everything. However, one advantage Mario has is that he can wall jump, which is something the other three are unable to do.
</li><li> Mario also is one of the most balanced characters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndSonicAtTheOlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndSonicAtTheOlympicGames">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games</a></em> titles. He is even classified as an "All-Around" character. He has decent strength, speed, and form, but he isn't the best at any of those categories, making him a safe bet for any event without being the best possible choice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioRPG">Super Mario RPG</a></em> has Mario as the all-around party member by having balanced offense and defense physically and magically, while his speed is only slightly below average. This is necessary, as he's the only character you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero">must always take into battle</a>; if he had more significant weaknesses, he'd become more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">Pick-Me-Up sponge</a> than ally and leader.
</li><li> This is averted by Mario himself in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioGolf">Mario Golf</a></em> games, where Mario is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongButUnskilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongButUnskilled">Strong, but Unskilled</a>, with a powerful swing, but little ball control.

It does help that she is one of the three available at the start.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">Killer7</a></em> offers seven playable elite assassins through which players can freely toggle. Their resident Jack is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Dan Smith</a>, whose balanced attack, speed, waver and critical skills usually make him the players' weapon of choice.

Dan has no weaknesses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptedEvent">unless scripted otherwise</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> In-universe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrossCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrossCode">CrossCode</a></em>, Lea's class, the Spheromancer, is considered to be this. It bypasses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">Fighter, Mage, Thief</a> aspects of the other four by combining them. It's noted that most players ignore the class, because it doesn't provide the raw power of the others.

The only really exceptional thing about him are his Optic Blast eye beam projectiles, which have good utility as a zoning tool.

Cap has a Level 3 Super Move which Cyclops doesn't, but it's one of the least useful Level 3 Supers in the series due to subpar damage for a move of its kind and the fact it's telegraphed pretty easily.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> has even more projectiles than Cyclops does, useful for keeping close-range fighters at bay. But once they're in close range, Iron Man doesn't have many ways to push someone back. Also, his combos and super moves have decent damage but predictable utility. Finally, he has slightly more health than Captain America, but not as much damage.
</li><li> Ryu and Ken, the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shotoclone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shotoclone">Shotoclones</a>, retain their stats and movesets from the <em>Street Fighter</em> series.

<ul><li> The two closest things the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast">Ensemble Cast</a> has to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">main protagonists</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">the Warrior of Light</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Lightning</a> are both shining examples of Jacks-of-All-Stats. They move fairly quickly but not fast enough to be a selling point (like Onion Knight), their BRV damage output is middle of the road (as opposed to very high like Squall or low like Shantotto), their HP attacks are of moderate difficulty to land (as opposed to easy like the Cloud of Darkness or very hard like Prishe), they have ranged and melee options (as opposed to Ultimecia, the distance fighter, and Jecht, the melee machine), they can fight in both the air and on the ground (without being specialists like air fighter Zidane and ground fighter Firion), and are relatively straightforward to use (that is, lacking in gimmicks like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMaster">Trap Master</a> Emperor or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">Barrier Warrior</a> Exdeath). And in <em>Dissidia</em>, this makes them very solid choices as while they lack big advantages, they also lack exploitable weaknesses in match-ups and especially don't have to worry about the stage they're fighting on (more useful than it sounds—while sucky stages suck for everyone, some characters are <em>severely</em> disadvantaged by stage, like Kain and Phantom Train, Firion and Planet's Core, Zidane or Kuja and Omega Sky Fortress Bahamut, etc).
</li><li> In <em>Duodecim</em>, Shantotto calls out on Firion using this very trope, but replacing Stats with Weapons.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Shantotto:</strong> "Jack of all weapons, master of none?"
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul</a></em> series, Mitsurugi falls under this with exact-center range, attack, and speed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">The only reason that he's still in the game</a> is that he's the series's Jack despite being largely (<em>entirely</em> in later games) irrelevant story-wise.

<ul><li> The Orthodox fighting style gives 'C' affinity level for almost every move in the game, except for Rough moves (cheap, dirty, and/or illegal attacks, rated D) and Technical moves (rollup pins and surprise submissions, rated B). This means potential for have extremely varied offense, to the degree of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a>, but this isn't without its drawbacks — since affinity level determines how much stamina is drained by performing a move, Orthodox wrestlers tire much more quickly than those with specialized fighting styles.
</li><li> The Shooter archetype is equivalent within the subset of MMA/shoot fighting styles (which includes Ground, Wrestling, Fighter, and Grappler). Shooters are equally skilled at punching, kicking, stretches, joint locks, suplexes, and clinched or grounded fighting — but they aren't the <em>best</em> at any of them.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Half-Life series has the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit (abbreviated as HECU). While they are not as strong as the other enemies that the player will encounter later on, they are still no slouches in combat. They usually require the use of good enough tactics against them and prep time is required to take them down.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>
<ul><li> The Master Chief fits this trope perfectly in-story. Whilst some of the other Spartan-IIs are superior to him in strength, speed, intelligence, marksmanship, etc., the Chief has the most balanced skill-set of the group outside of his second-in-command Fred-104, being good at everything rather than filling one specific niche. He's also the bravest and is a natural leader, and noted by Dr. Halsey (the architect of the SPARTAN-II program) to be the best of them all. Cortana chalks it up to something no one else ever saw but her: luck.
</li><li> By contrast, Spartan-III Noble Six of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HaloReach">Halo: Reach</a></em> has the same versatility and "hyper-lethal" rating as the Chief, but not nearly as much luck. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">Or any luck at all, really</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTriad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTriad">Rise of the Triad</a></em> has five characters you could play the game with, one being fast but squishy, another being a tank but slower... Taradino Cassatt is The Jack-Of-All-Stats, as he is average in everything.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeHunters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeHunters">Metroid Prime: Hunters</a></em>, Samus herself becomes the Jack-Of-All-Stats. She's the only Hunter without a unique weapon (aside from the fact that her missiles can home), and her alt form's abilities are average.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Soldier is considered to be very well-rounded. He's designed for leading the offensive, but he's also vital for filling gaps while on defense. He has slightly below-average speed (that he can compensate for by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketJump">rocket jumping</a>), slightly above-average health (that he can sacrifice for more mobility via rocket jumps), and deals good damage at almost any range. His rocket launcher is designed for direct attacks at medium range, but its accuracy and explosive power allows him to improvise harassing at long range or saturation bombing until dedicated Snipers/Demomen can regroup. He also has the greatest number of weapons out of any playable class, allowing him to potentially fill other roles (group support with the Banners and Disciplinary Action, extreme-mobility scouting with the Gunboats, sentry busting with the Direct Hit, picking off targets with the Market Gardener). While he's effective at low levels of play, rocket jumping has enough of a skill curve that he requires some work to master. In fact, his greatest aspect is that he has no exploitable weaknesses when played correctly. He doesn't truly counter any class, but the closest thing he has to a counter himself is the Pyro (and even that requires the Pyro to have good timing and the Soldier to not have his shotgun).
</li><li> A Pyro with a shotgun is an average speed, average health class with the most commonly appearing stock weapon (four classes out of nine use it, with the next most common weapon only appearing in two out of nine loadouts), reaching to medium range and doing moderate damage. Obviously not what the class was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">designed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseRangeCombatant">for</a>, but remarkable in that it manages to actually define an 'average threat' in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastOfSnowflakes">Cast of Snowflakes</a>. However, in higher levels of play, the Pyro is considered to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a>.
</li><li> While most defensive use of the Engineer involves turtling, some players use the Engy as a versatile combat class. Less agile than the Scout, but still faster than some classes. Not a dedicated healer, but can still dispense healing. Less imposing than the Heavy, but even mini-sentry-guns are good for area denial. He doesn't rocket-jump as well as the Soldier or Demo, but creative players can still "Sentry-Gun-Jump". Finally, his pistol and shotgun weapons give him decent close and mid-range damage output, but nowhere near the extremes of Pyro or Sniper.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield3">Battlefield 3</a></em> the M16A3 (and its three-round-burst counterpart the M16A4) has a reputation for being almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> due to the fact that it has the best reload speed of all the assault rifles but is <em>very</em> competitive with all the other assault rifles at all other statistics. If you were giving scores out of 10 for horizontal recoil, vertical recoil, rate of fire, first shot accuracy, reload speed, damage, handling and any other stat you can think of, it would have 9's across the board. It is competitive at <em>any</em> range.
</li><li> The assault rifles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ModernWarfare">Modern Warfare</a></em>'s multiplayer don't have the long range of a sniper rifle or the punch of a light machine gun and are slower than most sub-machine guns, both in your movement speed and in fire rate (and those that can match an SMG's rate of fire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">kick like a mule from it</a>). Despite that, assault rifles will do the job in practically any situation... just don't expect them to outperform other weapons in their designated roles (e.g. don't expect to be able to pull out an assault rifle faster than a SMG or outdamage a sniper rifle at long range).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyBlackOps">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a></em> has a more niche example with the Stoner 63. Based on a real-life "system weapon" that could be modified in minutes to fit the role of an assault rifle, carbine, squad automatic weapon or light machine gun, it's presented in-game in its assault rifle form but fits into the light machine gun class. In this case it ends up being a very <em>good</em> weapon because it almost universally gets the good points from one class instead of the negative points of the other - your movement is only slowed as much as by an assault rifle, your time to aim down the sights is quick, and your reload speed is relatively fast, but at the same time you have less recoil in full-auto than an assault rifle, the rate of fire is noticeably faster despite that, Extended Mags doubles the amount of ammo per magazine rather than only increasing it by 50%, it has higher penetration than any assault rifle bar the M14 and FAL, and it deals flat damage across any range rather than having damage drop-off at further ranges.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hawken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hawken">Hawken</a></em>, the CRT-Recruit mech you start with is the most balanced class, with the assault rifle and TOW missile giving it decent firepower at all ranges.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EYEDivineCybermancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EYEDivineCybermancy">E.Y.E.: Divine Cybermancy</a></em>, players who evenly distribute their XP will be given the class title of "Equilibrium Lord", which will eventually change into "Gray Master" with enough XP. Additionally, the weapons that start out unlocked are all very well rounded weapons, though generally a bit boring. For example, the BOSCO sniper rifle offers a large 25 round magazine, the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> most mooks with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">headshot</a>, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodSilencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodSilencer">silenced</a>, and is a lightweight and relatively short weapon, making it usable indoors - but the weapon is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">worse than useless</a> against enemies wearing heavy armor, and cannot penetrate walls (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill">or multiple mooks</a>) like the other two snipers, the Hunting Machine and the TRK A.D..
</li><li> Skyhammer and Stoker are the closest things <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirtyBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DirtyBomb">Dirty Bomb</a></em> has to a Jack of all Stats. Both have enough health to last in any engagement, and their assault rifles give them great accuracy and DPS at almost any range. Both of them also have enough movement speed to get to the fight in time to contribute to it, though they're also easily outpaced by almost every other dedicated Merc. They even form a hybrid with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> by providing infinite ammo for themselves and others! Bushwhacker and Sawbonez also qualify; though their submachine guns are less accurate at range and deal less damage, and they're slightly weaker and faster than Hammer and Stoker, they're still a good choice for frontline operations.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock2">BioShock 2</a></em> has the Rivet Gun, a versatile weapon that deals moderate damage with decent accuracy that acts as a decent backup weapon. This, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">works against it</a> as other guns are more accurate but slower (the Spear Gun), better at tackling groups of splicers (the Machine Gun), or deals with Brute Splicers and Big Daddies quicker (Grenade Launcher) and rivets become harder to find later in Rapture. Overall the Rivet Gun is used primarily to help you learn your play style and pull you out of a bind if you need it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> has Soldier: 76, who was designed to be an easy to play and versatile character. His weapon is a decently accurate assault rifle that can do decent sustained damage at range as well as fire rockets for burst damage. He can also sprint for added mobility and drop a Biotic Field for group healing and his Ultimate is a straight-up aimbot that lets him automatically target enemies without aiming. However, in spite of how varied his moves are, Soldier: 76 isn't the best at anything he does compared to other heroes.
</li><li> The shotgun in classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> fills this role, in an early aversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">Short-Range Shotgun</a>. It doesn't excel at any given category, but there are very few situations it isn't at least useful, with short-to-medium range, reasonable ammo consumption, good damage, and its status as a hitscan weapon ensuring that few things can go wrong when you fire it. (It is somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Overshadowed by Awesome</a> when the Super Shotgun is considered, though.)

<ul><li> The UN Peacekeeper faction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri">Sid Meiers Alpha Centauri</a></em> has no major explicit advantages or disadvantages due to ideology as opposed to the other factions. Turns out, this actually can come in handy as they are extremely adaptable. Also, they are the least crazy. They have some subtle modifiers: they have a small efficiency penalty (being modeled on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedNations">United Nations</a>, they're a bit too fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">legalistic bureaucracy</a>), can't be a police state, have happy citizens, can cram more people into small places (being founded by liberal intellectuals, their people don't care as much about material things and can live in tighter quarters) and get extra votes at meetings (representing their leader's experience as a parliamentary maneuverer). Nice abilities, small drawback (only one or two depending on whether or not you intend to be a ruthless conquering dictator). They're less obvious than any of the other factions' modifiers. The expansions factions are even less average.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CivilizationBeyondEarth">Civilization: Beyond Earth</a></em>, Franco-Iberia fits this trope in that their special ability simply gives them extra virtues that they can spend on any culture tree. Accordingly, instead of having a particular playstyle (aside from stacking culture), they can either get better at whatever playstyle they're pursuing or develop abilities to guard against their weaknesses.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfMagic">Master of Magic</a></em>, the Orcs are the Jack-Of-All-Stats. Of the 14 races in the game, they are the only ones who can build every possible city improvement, they have no inherent bonuses or penalties that come with using them, and they have no exceptionally powerful military units (but no pathetically weak units either).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheStars">Sword of the Stars</a></em>, the Humans and Tarka come closest to being The Jack-Of-All-Stats. Both have decent but unspectacular chances at high-end techs. Humanity has the 'average' values in things like population growth, research rate and ship toughness, but their strategic star drive is unusual - highest numerical speed but often forces a roundabout route that a skilled player may be able to take advantage of. The Tarka, meanwhile, has the hyperdrive, the most straight-forward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTL">FTL</a> drive, but it isn't particularly fast in any era. They are of a more industrial bent and their ships edge more towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> than humanity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris">Stellaris</a></em> features three weapon tech lines: kinetic, energy, and missile. Of the three, energy is strong against armor but weak against shields, kinetic is the other way round, and missiles are effective against both but not as much as their dedicated counters. (Missiles <em>do</em> have the schtick of being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysAccurateAttack">Always Accurate Attack</a>, but this gets countered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructibleProjectiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructibleProjectiles">point defenses</a>.)

<ul><li> The druid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> is a variation on this. This class can transform into a range of exotic creatures, becoming a stealthy assassin as a cat, a tank protecting the rest of the group as a bear, a powerful nuking spellcaster as an owl...thing, or walking tree as a healer. Each form can perform roughly as well as the class it mimics, so it's not exactly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a>, but generally with fewer "utility" abilities. A cat druid might have the raw DPS of a rogue but will not be able to keep opponents crowd controlled or constantly stunned as well as a rogue, the two caster forms have the raw spellpower of a priest but lack some key "panic buttons", and the bear will have the armor and stamina of a warrior but will have trouble tanking against multiple foes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>, the Scrapper is probably the truest Jack of All Stats around; it falls neatly between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Blasters</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Tankers</a>. For some mysterious reason, this results in 'Scrapperlock', which varies in severity from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">axe-craziness</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">omnicidal mania</a>, depending on the player and whether or not the targets in question have pissed them off. <br/><br/>All of the villain archetypes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfVillains">City of Villains</a></em> fall into this to some degree in that they overlap with each other while many of the hero archetypes are overly specialized (aside from the Scrapper). While the hero archetypes tend to prioritize either defense or offense, all villain archetypes were designed with a emphasis on offense and then differing types of defense to back it up. <br/><br/>The Mastermind was perhaps the master of being the Jack of All Stats; while the player would themselves have some useful buffs, debuffs and assorted weapons that could assist a team, the minions could provide firepower, melee abilities, tank, or act as distractions, or a combination of all of the above. Unlike many archetypes that really required a team because they had too few offensive/weak powers to solo, or archetypes that could solo but couldn't provide much support to other players on a team, Masterminds could solo easily while on a team their buffing abilities worked just as well on teammates as it did on their minions. A well built Mastermind could thus tank, blast, melee, and support all at the same time. <br/><br/>Most of the time though, the Jack of All Stats has traditionally been the Epic Archetypes. Peacebringers and Warshades in human form mix Attack (both ranged and melee), Defense, and Utility in fairly even amounts, and can become psuedo-Tankers or Blasters through special shape shifting powers. They even become more powerful depending on team makeup. (Peacebringers fill in weaknesses, while Warshades accentuate strengths.) Spiders and Widows have a mix of Melee and Ranged attacks (with the exact ratio depending on your career path), and have the ability to buff their allies to astronomical levels <em>just by being there</em>. A few Spiders and Widows can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">Cap</a> a team's stats without even trying.
</li><li> The Druid class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> is the Jack-Of-All-Stats among caster classes. The class is pretty good at fundamentals such as healing, buffing, and DPS, but not the best in any of these. Likewise they have some more specific masteries over movement and damage-over-time spells, but even in these the class is typically not the best. What Druids lose in specialization they gain in convenience at having such a variety of abilities. <br/><br/>The Human race in general in all <em>Everquest</em> games have completely average racial stats. They are intentionally the race by which all other races are compared to in terms of stats. In <em>Everquest 2</em>, they also happen to be the one race who has the most influence in the survivability of the other races in Norrath as well.

<ul><li> Celestial gear (and Runes of Divinity) are this, providing a boost to every stat. Most high-level gear provides a large bonus to one stat and a medium bonus to two others, while Celestial gear provides a somewhat smaller boost to all of them. The exception is Critical Damage, where Celestial gear provides as much as anything else in most cases. "Good for everything, perfect for nothing" is the general view of this.
</li><li> The Ranger profession is this too - not as much damage output as a Warrior, nor as much survivability as a Guardian, nor as much support as a Mesmer or an Elementalist, nor as much control as an Engineer, but competent in all those categories nevertheless.

<ul><li> The Minmatar "Typhoon" battleship is billed via the in-universe description as being versatile and fit to deal with most situations. In-game, it's a trashcan with a mix of slots (but still awesome).
</li><li> And, to a lesser degree, the Gallente Vexor. Though built as a drone boat, the low cost, combined with the sheer versatility of drone options makes this cruiser useful for combat, salvage, logistics.
</li><li> Perhaps nothing more than the special edition Guristas Chameleon, which combines covert-operations cloaking, ECM capabilities, missiles, and drones into a ship capable of doing nearly everything.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Karma was likely designed with this concept in mind, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">Martial Pacifist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">Combat Medic</a> whose backstory is all about trying to find balance. Very well-rounded stat-wise, less squishy than most wizards, with spells that work for both attack and support and a versatile R ability that can power up any one of her other spells. Unfortunately, since she doesn't really fall into any particular dedicated role in the metagame, she is a rather unpopular champion - a common joke among the playerbase is people not knowing who she is. Her lack of a flashy ultimate or interesting gimmick doesn't help either.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Cho'Gath</a> is feared primarily for just how many roles he can effectively play on a team.
</li><li> Irelia's play history has been very volatile (ranging from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> to considered awful), with developers citing her retrospectively having nearly every kind of tool a character could be given save for being a ranged character likely playing a major part in this.
</li><li> Described as "a ranged melee tanky DPS assassin mage tank support jungler. He excels at everything." in a joke spotlight, Lee Sin really is a very versatile champion with good base damage, mobility and utility that can be expected to be able to hold his own in many different environments with a high skill-cap that let him pull off some very impressive things with good hands using him. His major weakness is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">poor damage-scaling</a>.
</li><li> The character Jarvan IV contains a good amount of range in his abilities, a lot of utility and mobility and great innate burst damage to let him serve his team in numerous capacities. His main drawback is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">his poor base stats causing him to require some time to obtain levels and items for these traits to overtake his weakness</a>.
</li><li> Kayle. Like Mordekaiser, her power meters in all three areas are mid-range. Her kit includes armor shred, melee attacks, ranged attacks, physical damage, magic damage, burst damage, sustained damage, a slow, a speed boost, a heal, and an invincibility spell. She can play support, AD carry, AP carry / assassin, hybrid damage carry, bruiser, or tank. Her only real weakness is that she's not as good at any of those roles as the champions that specialize in one of them.
</li><li> Gangplank is also notoriously versatile in his builds and his skill kit. He's got a single target ranged poke that can become a nuke if built for damage, an AoE buff that's great for initiation or a disengage, a heal that can remove crowd control and debuffs, and a barrage of cannonballs for an ultimate that, because of its global range, can be used to help allies from anywhere with damage and a notable slow. He can be a bruiser, a ranged AD caster, a tank, a jungler and (as crazy as it sounds) a support. Like most everyone on this list, his weakness is that he can never quite reach the levels of efficiency that other, more specific champions do.
</li><li> Taric is this when compared with other supports. He can do some crowd control, but not as well as Blitzcrank, some sustain, but not as well as Soraka, some buffing and debuffing, but not as well as Lulu. Taric's main distinguishing feature is a low skill requirement compared with other supports- two of his skills simply hit anyone nearby, while the other two are single target clicks.
</li><li> Among junglers, Zac is this. He has long-range initiation, area of effect CC, sustained damage, is manaless, has strong natural sustain, and scales really well on tanking stats. There are others who are better at one or two of these aspects, but Zac's stuff ranges from "decent" to "second best" across the board. Of course, this can also be his weakness—because he's a generalist, not a specialist, he's passed over for champions who do that one thing much better than he does.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em> has quite a few examples as well:
<ul><li> Wraith King has a simple yet effective moveset consisting of a standard-issue fire-and-forget ranged stun with low cooldown, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDrain">Life Drain</a> aura, a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a>, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive">Auto-Revive</a> ultimate that also slows enemies nearby when it goes off. This grants him excellent sustain, damage, initiation, and support potential, letting him fill just about any role on the team.
</li><li> Alchemist's main schtick is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier">earning craptons of gold very quickly</a>, which logically pushes him towards carrying. However, he also possesses the unique ability to gave his team slotless Aghanim's Scepters. Combined with his powerful stun and reliable early game zoning from Acid Spray, there's nothing stopping Alchemist from playing support early on and then six-slotting himself after his team's carry gets farmed.
</li><li> Tiny, a mid-laning ganker who relies on massive point-blank burst that later takes on the role of a base-pusher and carry through items as his nukes fall off.
</li><li> Doom can can gain various skills by simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalismSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalismSuperpower">eating the corresponding neutral creep</a>, which also earns him a bit of bonus gold for good measure. This alone lets Doom customize his abilities and items for any situation. Add on some innate tankiness, respectable damage output, and an ultimate which translates to "neuter target hero for an entire teamfight" and you've got a particularly versatile hero.
</li><li> Lone Druid gets to summon a bear as his personal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">meat shield</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMultiplier">farm enhancer</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExitPursuedByABear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExitPursuedByABear">harasser</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiegeEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiegeEngines">tower redecorator</a> and the ability to switch between a fast but squishy ranged druid form and a slower but far more durable melee bear form. He also comes with decent damage output and a soft disable, letting the Druid adapt to most lineups. It also helps that he gets twelve item slots to work with between him and his bear as opposed to the usual six and can farm up quickly enough to take advantage of them.
</li><li> Naga Siren: Pushing, scouting, and farming with Expendable illusions, Engaging or Disengaging Teamfights with her ultimate, and just dogpiling people with all five of her.
</li><li> Leshrac has a solid mana pool, a spammable multi-target slow, and an area stun, making him a decent support. However, if Leshrac gets farmed, the other half of his skillset allows him to <em>vaporize</em> anyone who so much as approaches him, making him a workable carry as well.
</li><li> Nature's Prophet: Like Doom and Alchemist, his only real unique "Skill" is getting gold. Summonable meatshields to ward off creeps and eat tower shots, rings of trees to hide him or trap an enemy, global teleportation that has a seperate cooldown from TP scrolls, and a good auto-attack let him push, carry, support, jungle or gank.
</li><li> Silencer: An area of effect Damage Over Time ability that punishes the opponent for casting spells, a single target one that punishes opponents for <em>not</em> casting spells, and a massive manapool make him a <em>brutally</em> oppressive lane opponent that can solo the hard lane or tyrannize the enemy one, his Global Silence is one of the most powerful ultimates in the game and practically wins a teamfight by itself, no positioning required, irreversibly <em>stealing</em> 2 intelligence from anyone that dies near him, and gaining up to 90% of his intelligence as un-counterable pure damage while his over-the-top agility growth gives him further damage. He can support, counter-initiate, and Carry all in the same game without giving up <em>any</em> of those.
</li><li> While his abilities are specialized for support, Bane is notable for having a perfectly even set of base stats and stat growth.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Awesomenauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Awesomenauts">Awesomenauts</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sheriff Lonestar is the most well-rounded of the 'nauts. Depending on the items he's using, he's easily capable of sustaining, fast lane-clearing, turret-razing, harassing from afar, or even bursting and ganking enemies. His health is middle-line and his movement speed is rather low, but he can buy Barrier Magazine (a permanent shield upgrade usually reserved for tanks) and buying his Rocket Boots provides a source of uniquely-exceptional mobility. His Dynamite Throw is a good source of damage while his Hyper Bull's innate utility is excellent for helping himself or allies out of trouble.
</li><li> Chucho Krokk's main gimmick is getting on and off his flying hyper bike, granting an exceptionally unique form of versatility. He can easily break up teamfights or execute weak targets with his Sticky Bomb, he can apply plenty of pressure with his blasters, and in a pinch he can easily chase with his bike. His clearing power is only rivaled by Lonestar. But his sticky bomb damage isn't as high as assassin burst skills, he has less DPS than a normal brawler (and is considerably squishier), and he doesn't have any escape aside from his bike.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfTheStorm">Heroes of the Storm</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Starcraft">Tassadar</a> is "good at everything, best at nothing". While he's classified as a Support and is indeed decent at keeping allies alive by granting them shields, he's the only Support in the game with no healing ability, and the closest thing he gets is a talent that lets his shields persist indefinitely. He can push down towers and minions quickly, but not as quickly as a dedicated Specialist. While normally something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Archon</a> Heroic Ability allows him to tank and deal a significant amount of damage, but he's not as good at dealing damage as a dedicated Assassin nor is he as tanky as a typical Warrior. He lacks a hard disable, but partially compensates with talents that let him slow enemies and the Force Wall Heroic Ability, which lets him block off enemies. Finally, he can turn invisible and invulnerable briefly, which gives him a way to get out of trouble, but it's not quite as effective as some of the other repositioning/escape abilities in the game. All things considered, Tassadar's main outstanding quality is that almost no other hero has a kit as versatile as his.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Starcraft">Raynor</a> is the starter character for a reason - With a simple and versatile kit that includes a simple knockback, movement speed and attack buff, and a completely passive self-heal (sans talents), strong basic attacks that require no more than a right click, and a trait that simply lets you kick ass from further away, he is the quintessential "Easy to use, hard to master" jack of all trades. Most if not all starter characters, especially for Blizzard games (I'm looking at you, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Soldier 76</a>), are characters with boring but practical skill sets that are viable in every tactical scenario. The nature of his ultimates exacerbate this theme - Hyperion is a multi-use pushing/zoning/area of effect damage tool, while Raiders rounds things out by providing strong single target focusing power, much to the dismay of many invisible heroes. He may be labelled "Assassin", but he can also push and self heal in the vein of specialists and healers in a pinch as well (he shouldn't tank, but that's about all he can't do). Plus, he's so stupidly simple and cheap to buy at 2000 gold, that anyone can use him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Warcraft">Varian Wrynn</a> is this at lower levels but it's still true later on. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry">Charge</a> has to target an enemy player or minion and slows them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">Lion's Fang</a> also slows enemies, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleFencingPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleFencingPowers">Parry</a> blocks attacks directed at him for a second, and his passive lets him do double damage at set intervals. He can be built to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">tank</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">do burst damage</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">deal sustained DPS</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance">depending on talent choices</a>. That all said, he lacks a reliable escape tool, having only his Parry or the ability to Charge an enemy minion behind himself to get out of trouble, making his tanking build more about stunning and slowing enemies and drawing their attention temporarily as compared to other tanks. The only stuns or interrupts he has are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">Taunt</a>, and if you picked the right talents, his Charge, so there's limits to just how much he can stop opponents from doing what they want. In addition, this lack of escapes requires him to pick his battles much more carefully than other DPS assassins in those two builds, who often have some form of teleport, dash, or leap to get to safety in a pinch. The biggest strength of Varian, in fact, is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">he can be built three different ways and the opposing team can't counterpick based solely on the fact that they're fighting him</a>.

Specifically, Marines aren't as good in melee as Tyranids, as good at taking hits as Necrons, as good at ranged combat as Tau, as psychically powerful as Eldar, as speedy as Dark Eldar, as good with vehicles as Imperial Guard, or as numerous as Orks, but they're above-average or at least capable in all those categories, and they can become competitive with any of the above when geared up properly. And given the presence of Space Marine legions that do specialize (for instance, Space Wolves and Blood Angels focus on melee) and get special tricks for doing so, a Space Marine army could potentially be based on any strategy.

The baseline factions GDI, Nod, and Scrin may be considered the Jack-Of-All-Stats of each of the three armies, having a well-rounded arsenal in terms of their calculus without going to relative extremes in strengths and weaknesses. These primary factions have a great amount of strategies available for the most variety in game play. <br/><br/>For a simple example, the "Black Hand" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a> faction of Nod prohibiting access to Nod's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloakingDevice">stealth technologies</a> in favor of more overt "shock and awe" with more units that can be outfitted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Flamethrower</a> technologies and a unique upgrade that changes their flames to a more-damaging blue flame. However, they can't build regular aircrafts. <br/><br/>The "Marked of Kane" might be considered a polar-opposite of the "Black Hand", losing out on anything that shoots flames. This is in favor of greater availability of EMP attacks via trainable Cyborg infantry. This can conveniently off-set an enemy's numerical advantage in vehicles or disrupt an enemy's structure operations. <br/><br/>The standard Nod faction is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">somewhere in between the two sub-factions</a>, having access to a well-rounded arsenal including Flame-Troopers and Flame Tanks and stealth technologies, which enables them to flexibly switch between stealth attacks and harassing an enemy's base with flamethrowers. A good balance of frontal offense and surgical capability.

In later ages, however, it becomes clear that they're not the <em>best</em> at long range combat: their comparatively short range means they generally lose firefights to Skirmishers and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">Longbowmen</a>.

In practice, the Viking has essentially become something of a specialized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> anti-air unit.
</li><li> The Cyclone replaces the Goliath as the mid-grade attack-everything unit from the Factory. Their stats are well balanced with good hitpoints and a missile system that can engage both ground and air targets. However, micromanagement is what really brings out their potential; their lock-on ability lets them Lock-On outside of their regular range and fire upon a target up to a very long range, while an upgrade doubles their damage when locking onto armored targets. Lock-On is necessary to get the most out of them due to their mediocre performance when you attack-move with them, and moderate resource costs.
</li><li> The Protoss Photon Cannon certainly fits compared to other turrets. It's not as good at anti-air as a Terran Missle Turret or as good at dealing with multiple foes and anti-ground as a Bunker. It can't relocate like Zerg Spine Crawlers and Spore Crawlers. But it's the only turret that can attack air and land units while also functioning as a detector.

That is if he isn't a quite literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>; due to the fact that his single-target physicals are the best of the eight party members, his support skills are tied with Aigis for best, his magic is exceeded only by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> Mitsuru and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> Koromaru, and his healing is tied with Mitsuru for third.
</li><li> In the <em>FES</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>, Metis has no weaknesses or resistances, and has an assortment of strong physical, ice and wind skills. Her only downfall is her lack of decent support skills.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> Yosuke's abilities are a combination of strong Magic, good physicals and a useful buff with a decent but rapidly outclassed heal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> Makoto Niijima, aka Queen. The only really exceptional thing about her is a massive SP pool; otherwise, she has decent healing that's not as good as Morgana's, some decent physical skills that aren't as good as Ryuji or Yusuke's, and a defense buff spell for the party that many of Joker's personas can learn. None of Makoto's stats are more than middle of the road except her below-average Luck, and she learns the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower">Frei series of spells</a>, which not many enemies are weak against.
</li><li> Haru Okumura, aka Noir. Haru has a very diverse movepool, specializing in Psy magic and being the only one aside from Joker who can use Gun skills, but she can also use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackReflector">Attack Reflector</a> spells, has the best status effect removal spell, and the best single-target buff with Heat Riser, which improves every stat. The downside is her HP and SP aren't that great, and the limit of eight skill slots means solely focusing on Psy, Gun, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buffs</a> to make her truly effective; trying to focus on more than one leaves Haru as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a>.
</li><li> Goro Akechi, aka Crow. He only joins the party <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">for one Palace</a>, but his stats are decent all around, with a slight edge to his Strength. He learns Bless and Curse spells, as well as decent Physical and Almighty moves, along with good healing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buff</a> spells late into his growth. Akechi's most notable weakness is that his spells take a lot of HP or SP to cast, and his health and magic pools are both rather small, so he'll be draining his reserves pretty fast. Even when he rejoins the party in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Persona 5: Royal</a></em>, Akechi retains this mold in spite of learning a few different moves.
</li></ul></li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowHearts">Shadow Hearts</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yuri tends to be this role, although similar to Druids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> he has to shapeshift to gain these roles. In the first game, Halley <em>really</em> fits this role because he is like these all in one. However, he doesn't have the variety of Yuri, and his special attacks require a <em>lot</em> of MP. Yuri's final form is also like this, too but it's hidden for a reason.
</li><li> Shania in <em>From the New World</em> has the same gimmick, albeit less...broken, which lets her teammates shine a bit better while she boosts whatever aspect you need.
</li></ul></li><li> Dart and Haschel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a></em>. Both have decent speed physical and magical attack and defense stats though Dart is more rounded whereas Haschel is a bit more offensively based.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> - Many Pokémon have the same (or nearly the same) value for all their stats. They can have above or below average stats, but they're not strong or weak, slow or fast...
<ul><li> Applies especially to Mew, Celebi, Jirachi, Manaphy, Land Forme Shaymin and Victini, who have 100 in all stats. Arceus itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">has 120 in every stat</a>. And then there are Pokémon like Glalie and Phione, which have 80 all around.
</li><li> Lots of Generation I Pokémon fit this trope to a T, not only having stats across the board that all hover around 80 or 90, but also learning a wide variety of offensive and defensive attacks. Nidoking and Nidoqueen are the best examples of this; they both can learn a wide number of special and physical attacks (enough to cover about 13 of the 17 types in the game, and two of those were useless offensively), and have the stats to use the moves reasonably well. Though a bit more specialized move-wise, the starting Pokémon from Generations I and II also qualify.
</li><li> Water-types tend to be these in general, having decent defensive stats along with decent offensive stats and offensive typing; only three types can resist Water, two of which can be countered by Ice-type attacks that a vast majority of Water-types can learn. As a bonus, it's one of four types that can deal neutral damage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Steel</a>. It's tied only with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneElement">Dragon</a> in terms of neutral coverage. Its only real shortcoming statistically is that Water-types tend to be on the slow side.
</li><li> Seismitoad in Generation V is very middle of the road, with a decent typing but a somewhat lack of moves, and almost all of its stats are close together.
</li><li> Kingdra. It's got a good defensive typing (Water/Dragon) with only two weaknesses, a double resistance to Water and Fire, and it's not weak to Ice, Electric, or Grass. Its stats are all right together, with a pretty good 95 in physical and special Attack and Defense as well as an above-average 75 base HP and alright 85 base speed that can double under the effects of heavy rain with the proper ability.
</li></ul></li><li> The Shining Fighter in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CustomRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CustomRobo">Custom Robo</a></em> series is the Jack of All Stats; average speed, effective in both land and air, you can basically equip this guy with about any weapons and he'll be effective. Fighters can actually be specialists depending on the other parts equipped; they just don't directly lend themselves to a particular strategy.
</li><li> Clavats in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyCrystalChronicles">Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles</a></em> games that let you pick your race. They have moderate to good stats in everything, with no glaring weaknesses or strengths. Conversely, Selkies have quick charge attacks and longer range; Yukes have the fastest spell casting and can become intangible (but with low defense when not defending); and Lilties, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser">Cute Bruiser</a> race in an already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuniPlush">Puni Plush</a> series, have the highest normal attack of the 4 races. Clavats have above average defense and moderately fast spell casting, but nothing special compared to the other 3, specialized tribes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, the Sentinel class. With access to both tech and biotic powers, but not the strongest of either, and decent but not exceptional combat ability (at least provided you picked a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">ammo power</a> as your bonus), Sentinels fare about equally well in all situations. They are also the only class with countermeasures for every kind of enemy protection (shields, barriers and armor) right out the gate.
</li><li> Miranda fulfils this role among the squadmates, being a Sentinel herself minus the Tech Armor. She's decent with weapons, has fairly good tech abilities, and is a competent biotic. Her passive ability doesn't just boost her own stats, but adds a small bonus to the health and weapon damage of the entire squad.
</li><li> Kasumi, unusually for a tech-focused squad member, can also fill this role. Her Shadow Strike ability does extremely high damage to all defense types, incapacitates enemies if she damages their health, and allows her to act somewhat as a tank (she distracts enemies into attacking her, but she is only vulnerable for a very short period of time, so she rarely takes any noticeable damage). Flashbang Grenade is the most multipurpose crowd control ability in the game (it disables weapons and hampers both biotic and tech power usage), has a massive <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoE">Ao E</a>, and works normally regardless of whether or not enemies have defenses. Overload gives her the ability to remove shields on multiple enemies or as a multipurpose anti-synthetic skill with enough points in it.
</li><li> The Sentinel class gets even more versatile in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, where every class can use all the weapons now, but only the Soldier gets damage bonuses with them all, and the weight system means that carrying too many will cause your cooldowns for powers to suffer. However, the Sentinel has mid-tier weight capacity (lower than the Soldier but higher than the Adept or Engineer), and Tech Armor helps with durability greatly. In addition to this, the Sentinel has gained the very powerful Lift Grenades, and their tech powers are now even more capable of mezzing enemies and stripping their defenses (Cryo Blast hits through defenses and Overload, in addition to doing more damage against shields, can be evolved to knock down and paralyze enemies) whereas their biotic powers can now cause rapid biotic explosions with the Warp/Throw combo. So now it's equally viable to have a Sentinel build that paralyzes, stuns, and cripples enemies with tech powers so their teammates can take them out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">pelts enemies with rapidfire biotic explosions while ignoring tech armor and good weapons</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">goes out and blasts everything with high-tier guns and grenades while shrugging off damage,</a> or more likely, a combination of all of the above
</li><li> In <em>3</em>, Kaidan takes over this role in Shepard's party, having access to an assault rifle, biotic and tech attacks, and two different ways to make him more survivable (Reave and Barrier).
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games have a Jack of All Stats, often the lead character. This character is typically near but not quite at the top of the heap in fighting ability and somewhere in the middle of the pack in magical ability, and any special abilities they have will be fairly general-purpose and not push them to the top of either of these categories. Examples include:
<ul><li> Vaan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> has very good stats all around. Most of them are the 2nd highest out of the party, allowing him to fit neatly into any role you need fulfilled.
</li><li> Lightning and Sazh, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>. They both have even strength and magic, and their capabilities with all 6 roles are good, but the two go about the trope differently:
<ul><li> Lightning has high strength and magic &amp; acts fairly quickly, allowing her to multitask effectively. However her health is quite low, forcing her to remain quick, and her weapons don't really pack much of a punch, so she can't really specialize.
</li><li> Meanwhile Sazh has high health and his weapons have very high and lopsided stats, allowing him to shift into whatever role is needed. Unfortunately his strength and magic are the lowest when not factoring in weapons, so his weapons practically are what determines his effectivness.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em>, the Red Mage class definitely fits the bill. They can equip quite a few different weapons, but not as many as the dedicated fighters. They can cast both white and black magic spells, but they don't get as many magic points as the dedicated wizards. Their statistics fall right about in the middle of the pack. This also makes the Red Mage by <em>far</em> the best character for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloCharacterRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoloCharacterRun">Solo-Character Run</a>. The Red Mage's access to both kinds of magic <em>and</em> lots of good weapons is a huge advantage that no other class shares.
</li><li> Building a character as a Red Mage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em> will result in this: greater stats on average, but lower stats individually compared to more focused characters. Of the starting characters, Firion has this predisposition; Gordon is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> example and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Scott</span> fills this role in the Soul of Rebirth bonus mode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>'s main character Cecil fills this role after his class change from a Dark Knight to a Paladin when compared to the rest of the endgame party. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> who gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">all the best equipment</a>, but he can't quite reach the damage levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> Kain's jump or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> Edge's throwing stars. And while he can use white magic, it's nowhere near as good as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> Rosa's, and the black magic is left exclusively to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> Rydia. The only real notable thing about Cecil is his ability to take a hit with the best Defense, but since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero">he can't be switched out</a>, this is kind of a necessity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>, the Blue Mage and Red Mage have average, subpar stats, somewhat mitigated by the fact that they can equip most of the sword-based weapons in the game at that point. It helps that the Blue Mage can grow <em>severely</em> overpowered in the early game, with spells like White Wind, Death Claw, and others - and while the Red Mage starts and finishes weak, their ultimate ability, Dualcast, synergizes with other classes to provide a boatload of pain... if you want to grind long enough to get it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>:
<ul><li> Cid. He's designed to be a toned-down version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Master of All</a> Cloud, with similar great, offensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> skills and equivalent weapons (both the only characters to get Triple-growth Materia weapons), but lower stats in general. Since he becomes party leader when Cloud is absent, this allows the player to use him in whatever way they had been using Cloud.
</li><li> Red XIII is the fastest character in the game but is middle-of-the-road in all other stats. He's not as tough as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyIneptFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyIneptFighter">Magically Inept Fighter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> Barret, he's not as magical as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizards</a> Aeris and Vincent, but he can do everything OK, and has a mixture of offensive and support Limit Breaks that make him an effective attacker or healer depending on what you want.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kimahri is completely in the middle of the road in terms of stats. However, his path on the Sphere Grid is noticeably shorter than any other character's, meaning he can cross into other characters' paths, giving him a little bit of everything and making him a very versatile and useful character if raised properly.
</li><li> Wakka also has fairly balanced stats, decent in about every category and with a much longer grid. What sets him apart are his unusual tricks that allow him to inflict status and his long-range attacks. If a character just needs stat-buffing in general, send them to Wakka's grid.
</li></ul></li><li> Jusqua in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyThe4HeroesOfLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyThe4HeroesOfLight">Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light</a></em> has all of his stats - Strength, Intelligence and Spirit - cap out at the exact same level of 65.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> had three different Jedi classes: the Guardian, who focuses on lightsabers and combat; the Consular, who focuses on negotiation and Force powers; and the Sentinel, who seeks a balance between the two. The Sentinel was actually, theoretically, not supposed to fill the role of this trope. The Sentinel specialized in skills, which were almost pointless, since essential skill checks were few and far between, they weren't very important to pass and your party members were much better at them in most situations anyway. They were closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> as a result, since their physical combat was only marginally better than Consulars (who were the archetypal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>) and their force powers were only marginally better than the Guardians (who were almost pure fighters).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreedomForce">Freedom Force</a></em>, the Minuteman fits this trope, which is probably why he's the first character you get in the first game. He's not as strong as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Supercollider</a>, not as tough as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Microwave</a>, not particularly fast, and he can't fly. However, his basic mix of abilities makes him useful in almost any situation, making him more versatile than most characters.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em> tends to go down the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>" route when it comes to its Jack-of-All-Stats characters.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, Kratos and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Zelos</a> have movesets that borrow from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> Lloyd and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> Genis, but don't exceed either of them statistically. Kratos and Zelos also don't get abilities that do quite as much close-range damage as Lloyd or as much spell damage as Genis. Kratos and Zelos can also both cast First Aid, but their healing ability is nowhere near the power of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> Raine. In short, while the two Magic Knights can do anything, someone else in the party can do it better.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss">Tales of the Abyss</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a> Asch treads <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> territory when you first meet him, due to having all of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Luke's</a> skills and four elemental spells as a bonus. But when you meet up with Asch again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">your whole party will have outdone him in stats</a>, turning him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfHearts">Tales of Hearts</a></em>, your Jack of All Stats is Kohak.

His short bio even points out the fact that he's a jack-of-all-trades.
<ul><li> The third game has Toramaru, who initially says his position is "anything but goalkeeper." His stats are also fairly even across the board, except his Kick stat is slightly higher and also grows a bit faster as he levels up. However, the story eventually reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's actually a very talented forward, but he hides his talent because he's shy and afraid his teammates will think he's hogging the action. After he overcomes his shyness, he subverts this trope and starts to specialize as a forward, and the remainder of his hissatsu techniques are all shoot techniques.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em>, the player character is this in-story. The game's plot involves recruiting the three Heroes of Strength, Skill (marksmanship/agility/speed/etc.) and Will (Magic), who are implied to be the master of each discipline. However, your character is a rare exception who can learn all three disciplines, and given that he/she is descended from a near-demigod who could do the same, so by the end of the game, you can surpass the other three Heroes and master each discipline, shedding your Jack of All Stats status and becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">the most powerful person alive.</a>

This eventually unlocks the Universalist destiny ("Destinies" in this game act like character classes, but can be changed at any time if the player has the requisite skill points in the applicable disciplines). The Universalist doesn't get the flashier special abilities given to other Destinies, but gets 20% bonuses to all attack and defense types, has skill point requirements for armor greatly reduced, and gains access to every weapon-mastery skill. Slightly averted in that a carefully done Universalist build can max out (master) all the non-combat skills.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a></em> has the Holy Roman Empire faction, and its strength is "strong all-around".
</li><li> Riki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>. He has the highest HP, third highest ether, third highest agility, and fourth highest strength out of the seven member cast, while his defenses can be equal to the others. He also has an art that can temporarily boost a random one of his stats by a huge degree, making it vastly exceed that of any other character for the duration (With the exception of strength, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Reyn</a> can still beat him). This coupled with a potent heal and wide variety of offensive and supportive arts make him extremely useful in any team formation.
</li><li> Virgil, the first follower you can recruit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Arcanum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Arcanum">Arcanum</a></em>. He has enough dexterity to reliably hit things in combat, but his relatively low strength means he can't deal damage as quickly as a pure melee/dodge character. He has some skill with lockpicks, but there are other lockpicking characters in the game who will surpass him, and unlike those he doesn't develop his prowling skill so he's likely to be discovered if he attempts to pick locks for you. His biggest asset to the party is his magic, since he focuses on healing and can be invaluable for keeping your party alive during long dungeon crawls, without having any of the fancier tricks that pure mages who specialize in other colleges can have.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Balanced</a> class from <em>Sinjid: Shadow of the Warrior</em> is this. It benefits from both physical and magic attacks, and its stats are well-rounded. Balanced characters tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">Crutch Characters</a>; they start out good due to said abilities, but become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Masters Of None</a> lategame because they have no glaring strengths unlike the other available classes. When he's not activating his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Rage</a> mechanic, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">doubles his strength but reduces his speed by 35%</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarmUpBoss">Mad Lord Yuji</a> from <em>Sinjid</em> is well-balanced.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em>: The Sword and Shield weapon was originally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> but over time it's evolved into this trope, being able to do a little bit of everything, albeit not as well as weapons that are more specialized. The shield lets you defend, but not as well as defense-oriented weapons like the Lance; it hits fast, but not as quickly as the Dual Blades; it's good at mounting, but not as good as the highly mobile Insect Glaive, and so on. The S&amp;S's main quirks include having both slashing and blunt damage (via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShieldBash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShieldBash">Shield Bash</a>), good movement speed, and the ability to use items like potions, bombs, and <em>World</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmCannon">Slinger</a> without having to completely sheathe the weapon, making it an ideal choice for Support builds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableI">Fable I</a></em>: The sharpening augmentation of the five augmentations that boost damage. Silver, piercing, fire, and lightning all boost damage more than sharpening does but only against a few types of enemies. Meanwhile the sharpening augmentation boosts damage by a flat 10% against all enemies, making it ideal for your main weapon (though keeping backups filled with the other augmentations is a good idea).
</li><li> The Human race in <em>Monster Girl Quest: Paradox</em> has balanced stats and no weaknesses or resistances to elements or status effects. It does have one specialty: learning abilities that manipulate experience gain. Human characters become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master Of Nones</a> later on due to not being able to switch to more advanced races, unlike the monster and angel characters. However, there are sidequests that unlock additional races that humans can advance to, making them useful again.
</li><li> In the meta of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>, Waver Velvet/Zhuge Liang tends to look like this. There are three other powerful support casters in the game: Tamamo-no-Mae, who supports <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>-heavy Arts teams, Merlin, who supports the high-damage Buster teams, and Scathach-Skadi, who supports <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass">crit-killing</a> Quick teams. Waver, on the other hand, does not support any specific team composition, as all his skills merely provide regular boosts to damage, defense, and NP charge. However, this also means that while he isn't as good as any of the above in their specific team composition, he also fits into any team composition, because there isn't a team in the game that doesn't want what he provides.

So much, that on the (five-point) stat chart it looks like a perfect hexagon. The MiG-29 has also tended to be like this: a decent dogfighter with passable but nothing-to-look-at air-to-ground special weapons, eclipsed in both fields by the specialised birds, and once you get the proper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruisers</a> in your inventory there's little point in using the Fulcrum any more.
</li><li> The F-18 Hornet tends to be this throughout the series due to its decent speeds and maneuverability, supplemented by a versatile weapons loadout that allows it to fight anything on any terrain. It eventually gets outstripped by faster and more powerful late-game planes, but serves as a pretty reliable workhorse whenever it becomes available (usually) midgame.
</li><li> In games which use a classification system for planes, this is the purpose of Multiroles: they tend to have both anti-air and anti-ground weapons, have moderate scores in all stats allowing them to both dogfight and ground pound decently, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat6FiresOfLiberation">Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</a></em> they all have four special weapons instead of three like Attackers or Fighters. In some cases they actually outpace Attackers, since they can simply take a moment to pick off any fighters chasing them rather than having to either evade or tank their attacks.

</li><li> On the other side of the coin, there's the TIE Interceptor. The TIE Fighter is faster overall, and the slower TIE Advanced gets shields, while the TIE Bomber has the most raw destructive power. The TIE Interceptor, however, falls right in between the three—only marginally slower than the TIE Fighter, but far better armed and armored while being significantly faster than either the TIE Advanced or the TIE Bomber.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace">FreeSpace</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first game of the series, there's the GTF Apollo, a space superiority fighter that combines good missile bank capacity and durability with a high level of agility. It's not hard to see why it happens to be the very first fighter you start off in, since its combination of characteristics make it quite easy and forgiving to play with. Its main shortcoming is its slow default speed, although this can be partially overcome by increasing engine power output at the expense of guns and shielding.
</li><li> The second game starts you off in the GTF Myrmidon, a newer space superiority fighter with six gun ports instead of the usual four. On paper, the Myrmidon seems to be a good overall fighter due to its above average firepower and balanced stats, but it actually suffers from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a>. It can't carry the best anti-fighter missile and has a level of manoeuvrability that is only just better than most heavy assault fighters and bombers, making it a mediocre dogfighter at best. Moreover, due to its balanced stats, it can't do particularly well in the assault role because its durability and missile capacity are nowhere close to that of a true heavy assault fighter. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Its only saving grace is its ability to carry the Helios Bomb, a heavy anti-capital ship weapon that is otherwise reserved for bombers only</a>, though there are no single player missions where it is available as a weapons option.
</li><li> Given the choice, most players would opt for the GTF Perseus, which is indisputably one of the best fighters in the game and a true spiritual successor to both the Apollo and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Valkyrie interceptor</a>. It's not the fastest or most agile fighter in the game, but it manages to have a high level of both without compromising durability or missile capacity. In spite of its interceptor classification, the Perseus is a superb dogfighter and can be kitted out to perform multiple roles at once.

Fast enough to keep up with carriers and outrun cruisers, packing enough dakka to fend off fighters and bombers, enough guns to kill PT boats, depth charges to hunt submarines, and torpedoes powerful enough to kill battleships. A skilled destroyer player is a forced to be reckoned with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em>Mechwarrior Online</em>, the standard 50-ton <em>Centurion</em> is explicitly regarded in its introduction video as a simple and balanced generalist 'Mech, being middle-of-the-road for size, speed, firepower, and armor. It's even well balanced in its weapons profile, with a 10-damage long-range missile launcher for support fire, a 10-damage medium-range autocannon for skirmishes, and two 5-damage close-range lasers for brawls.
</li><li> Throughout the series, Medium 'Mechs in general are viewed as middle of the road, an acceptable tradeoff between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">speed and agility of light 'Mechs</a> and the thick armor and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">firepower of heavy and assault 'Mechs</a>. Midweight 'Mechs won't provide the greatest speed or the most power, but will have just enough of both factors to contribute meaningfully in battle.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> series:
<ul><li> M4 interceptors among fighter craft combine good speed and agility with slightly above average shielding and firepower. They tend to be more ubiquitous than other craft below M6 corvettes. Among the technological scale of the races, Argon ships fit this trope as a whole, being neither good or bad in either area; Terran and OTAS ships are the upscale variants of Argon ships, moving them more into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> territory. The only drawbacks with Terran ships are the limited weapon selection and the scarcity of their weapons, which makes it particularly frustrating for their fighters and frigates.
</li><li> Among capital ships, frigates tend to be the most balanced in general stats, combining the speed and agility of a corvette with the firepower of a carrier, in addition to having a balanced cargo capacity. The drawback of frigates is the somewhat lacking capability to mount certain capital ship weaponry, and one particular weapon compatible for frigates as well as the larger capital ships must be bought in a factory belonging to the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Space Pirates</a> population, which the player might already have unfriendly relations with, thanks to the tendency to make enemies with them whether in or out of particular side quests, and their economy being in a sorry state.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySimsAgents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MySimsAgents">MySims Agents</a></em>, Lyndsay is the closest to this when it comes to Dispatch Missions, having a point each in Nature, Charismatic, and Smarts, and two in Athletic. All the rest have 2-2-1, 3-1-1, 3-2, 4-1, or 5 in their Interests, but Lyndsay has something of a spread, making her of very limited usefulness in any given mission... but at least she's guaranteed to contribute something to any mission you send her on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em>
<ul><li> As a general rule, medium tanks are this; not quite as tough as heavy tanks, not quite as mobile as light tanks, not quite as gun as tank destroyers, but tough enough, mobile enough and gun enough.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3kumt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3kumt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3kumt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are exceptions that slide a bit more towards mobility, armor and firepower, but <em>generally</em> medium tanks are middle of the road.</span>
</li><li> Compared to the tanks of other nations, American tanks are some of the most rounded. Their tank guns in particular strike a balance between damage (a specialty of the Soviets), rate of fire (a specialty of the British), and accuracy (a specialty of the Germans). Also, they are less armored and more nimble than German or Russian tanks though not to the extent of the late-tier French tanks.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfWarships">World of Warships</a></em> in general has the cruiser: destroyers are faster, stealthier, and typically aim and fire their guns faster, but don't have as much firepower and no armour to speak of. Battleships have bigger guns that can obliterate a smaller ship with a single salvo, much tougher armour, but are less maneuverable and are slower to aim and fire. The typical cruiser neatly fits in between, being tougher than a destroyer and carrying heavier guns while being faster and more maneuverable than a battleship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hardwar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hardwar">Hardwar</a></em> has the Hawk Moth. It has a well-balanced combination of speed, maneuverability, toughness, cargo carrying capacity, and weapons capacity - all in one package in the above average territory. This makes it the most versatile Moth in the game and is by far the most popular one out of all the others among the pilot classes in Titan who aren't looking for a specifically combat-oriented Moth so much that the vast majority of Moths flying around in the city of Misplaced Optimism are Hawks.
</li><li> The Mocchi species in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em> is generally an entire <em>breed</em> of Jacks of All Stats— their stats are typically well-balanced, and they make a good beginner's monster. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Due to the nature of the games</a>, this may not always be to their advantage.

Mario gets the prize, though, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">all three stats for him are just in the middle of the skill gauge</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em>Snowboard Kids</em> has Slash, with 2 stars in Speed, Corner, and Trick. Made even Jack-er with the 'All Around' board type, which has equal values in all three board stats. Shinobin is also a Jack, with 2.5 stars in his stats.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports">Backyard Sports</a></em> series provides a meta-example, as the reason the neighborhood kids are always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityPower">overshadowed by the pros</a> is that the pros specialize in their respective sports, while the neighborhood kids play many different sports.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em>Mutant League Hockey</em>, teams are rated on a scale of 6-0 skulls; the more skulls, the better the team. Most of the 3-skull teams are very much middle-of-the-pack, with average stats among their starting lineup and no outstanding strengths or weaknesses. This is especially true of the teams that don't have a notable All-Star on the roster — namely the Deathskin Razors, the St. Mucus Ooze, the Montroyale Cadavers, and the War Slammers.
</li><li> In <em>2020 Super Baseball</em>, the Naples Seagulls are the only "Balance"-type team, broadly efficient but without special strengths. The Aussie Battlers, a "Chance" team, have middling-to-low stats except for ???/Luck, which means they have a pretty good chance of making freak plays.

</li><li> Team Hamstars takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by being in the middle of the spectrum both in ERA and batting average, <em>and</em> having all female players, so the stats are the same for everyone; they don't have any specialist for power or speed.

<ul><li> Mutant Humans don't stand out in any particular statistical category the way the other species do — they can't jump as high as demons, hit as hard as orcs, take hits like robots, come back for more like skeletons, etc. They also lack those species' <em>drawbacks</em>, making them a good fit at any position.
</li><li> In Dynasty mode, you have to develop a team of rookies into contenders. The entire team starts with a 40 overall rating and 40/100 in every stat, meaning the <em>floor</em> for their development is being able to do a little of everything; many other players with double the overall or more have stats in the 30s, 20s, and even 10s in categories less essential to their position (e.g. linebackers who can't intercept the ball, wideouts who can't block for the RB).

Leaders, however, are faster than Soldiers, tougher than Scientists, and better-equipped than Scouts. The end result is that, contrary to their class names, you will likely see more Leaders than Soldiers in an 'average' multiplayer game.
</li><li> Assaults in classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MondayNightCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MondayNightCombat">Monday Night Combat</a></em> are deliberately designed to be all-rounders. Of the six classic pros, the Assault has more defensive ability than the Assassin or the Sniper, but is faster than the Gunner or Tank. The Support falls in slightly below the Assault in terms of stats, but due to his focus on being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurretMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTurretMaster">The Turret Master</a> he is less suited to direct combat than the Assault, who can fill most offensive and defensive roles until a more specialized pro is available.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em>: Excalibur has a rounded set of stats and a decent mix of damage and utility moves. There are better "casters", better tanks, better damage-focused frames and better utility-focused frames, but most of those require a fair bit of skill to use well, and Excalibur's rounded loadout makes him good for beginners.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>: Shooters are automatic water-gun-type weapons that are fairly boring when compared to the other two types of weapons available.

Rollers can cover tons of ground in a short space of time and can also instantly take out any enemies they runs over, but their ability to attack at range is limited to a cumbersome "splatter" attack that is hard to aim. Shooters, meanwhile, are mostly decent midrange choices, and the nature of their projectiles means that they can paint up walls and slopes with ease, while still being able to mix it up with anything the enemy can throw at them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Nintendo Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Andy, which has no effect on his troops, be it positive or negative, as well as a repair power that has an average charge time and is useful for all units. In the reboot <em>Days of Ruin</em>, the closest is possibly Carter/Forsythe, who has no CO power and a universally useful (and friggin' huge) CO aura, or Isabella/Catleia, who also has a universal (and pretty fair-sized) CO aura and a universally useful CO power (+2 movement to all direct combat units, +2 range to all indirects).
</li><li> Several other COs also hit this formula of having minimal drawbacks and small advantages that affect all troops. Hawke, for instance, can be seen as an evil version of Andy, with a universal small boost on the attack strength of all his units and powers that heal his troops while draining his enemies (he is balanced compared to Andy, as he doesn't heal for as much and his power charges slower). That said, the nature of the game means that even characters who seem to be generalists have places they do well or poorly in; for instance, Andy is a natural counter to characters like Olaf, Drake, and Hawke, which have mass-damage powers.
</li><li> As far as units go, Tanks. Not as fast as Recons, not as powerful or tough as their cousins (Medium Tank and higher), and not as cost-efficient as Mechs but still remain the dominant ground unit on small maps and are a staple of early gameplay.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> The main Lord character of each of the games usually fulfills this role. However, their stats usually end up good enough for many of them to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruisers</a> instead. For example, Eliwood from <em>The Blazing Blade</em> belongs to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a> of Lords—one a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> and the other a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a>, leaving humble Eliwood to fill this role between them.
</li><li> Across the series, the Cavalier and Mercenary classes tend to sport the most evenly balanced stats across the board, rarely excelling in any particular stat, and several of the former are often given to the player fairly early in the story. (Its upgrade is also the traditional class of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrutchCharacter">"Jagens."</a>) Usually, you will have two cavaliers that <em>slightly</em> specialize (usually one leaning towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> and the other towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a>), but are still well-rounded overall.
</li><li> It also seems to be series tradition that the first Archer to join in a game (who is usually male), will be this while the second archer (who is usually female) will have more specialized stats, such as Wolt and Dorothy in <em>Binding Blade</em> and Wil and Rebecca in <em>Blazing Sword</em>. The former is usually now known as the "Gordin" archetype, after the first Archer in the series. Oddly enough, <em>Path of Radiance</em> inverted this. It's Rolf, the second Archer, who is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>, while Shinon joins early but is already promoted and usually becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a>, but getting him there is difficult.
</li><li> Speaking of Mercenaries, there is the "Ogma" archetype, which is a sword-wielding mercenary unit that starts out with balanced stats and above average/balanced stat growth and they usually come in early or middle of the storyline. They can promote into the Hero class, where they can use axes along with swords and balanced stat caps.
</li><li> Anima Magic in FE6/FE7/FE8 is more well balanced in comparison to the light and accurate but weak Light Magic and the strong but heavy and inaccurate Dark Magic. Lance weapons follow much the same pattern, slotting in between swords and axes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Awakening</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Avatar</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a> classes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">Tactician and Grandmaster</a> are this statistically; their maximum stats before character-specific modifiers are applied are a uniform 25 and 40 respectively. Furthermore, the skill the Grandmaster learns at level 5, Ignis, takes full advantage of the class's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a> nature - it randomly activates with odds equal to your skill stat, and adds half your magic stat to the physical damage you're attacking with, and vice-versa for magic attacks. On any other class, this skill would be useless.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fates</a></em>, the Spear Fighter and its promotion are this, which is fitting as lances/naginatas are this among the physical weapons. Oboro, the main playable Spear Fighter, enforces this, with the majority of her growth rates lying in the 50-55% range.
<ul><li> Saizo is this among the Ninja trio. Kaze is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> while Kagero is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>. Saizo is sturdier but otherwise his growth rates are very similiar to Oboro's, although he does have an unusually high Magic stat for a physical unit, which lets him use the Flame Shuriken more effectively than the other two.
</li><li> Furthermore, Camilla fills this role among the royal siblings in <em>Conquest</em>, with fairly equal stats in strength, defense, speed, and resistance. And not only can she attack physically with axes, but she can also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">wield tomes</a>, although her magic growth is generally too low for her to use them in the long-run. The magic Bolt Axe fixes this issue, though.
</li><li> Takumi would fill this role within <em>Birthright</em>'s royal family were it not for his unique and <em>very</em> powerful bow. His stats and growth rates are actually very evenly balanced, even gaining good defense for an Archer (although his Resistance is problematic), but his Fujin Yumi is so powerful that he ends up becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> when he otherwise would be this.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em>:
<ul><li> Leonie has low Magic and Resistance, plus a poor spell list, but has decent to high growths in every other stat and some of the highest base stats in the game. While she leans into Bow Knight due to her proficencies in lances/ bows, and riding, she also has no skill weaknesses, allowing her to take up any non-magical class to some degree of success.
</li><li> Sylvain's only truly low growth is in Resistance, and his only skill weakness is in bows. He has passable to good stats in every other category plus a budding talent in reason, allowing him to become a good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>. As a magic class, he learns mostly fire magic, which is balanced between power and accuracy; and he's the only male character to learn the monster-killing Seraphim.
</li><li> Ferdinand has similar growths to Sylvain, trading some Defence and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyIneptFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyIneptFighter">Magically Inept Fighter</a> for Dexterity and Luck. Like Leonie, he has no skill weaknesses, but he also has four proficencies (swords, lances, axes, riding) and a budding talent in heavy armor, allowing him to slide into most physical classes. That being said, compared to Leonie and Sylvain, he's also a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>, not helped by his personal skill encouraging fast but frail classes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Byleth</a> has no low growths and no skill weaknesses, making them flexible. While they lean into physical classes, their plot-related personal class, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Enlightened One</span>, allows them to use magic and offers a good modifier. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero">This is good, as Byleth is force-deployed on every map in the game.</a>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder21" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Humans don't get any stat bonuses or penalties in early editions, making them more likely to default to balanced. Starting around 4th Edition, when races became more specialized, humans instead got +1 to all ability scores, as opposed to getting +2 in specific ability scores. In addition, humans aren't generally classified as any one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignments</a>, with sourcebooks saying that "the best and the worst are found among them".
</li><li> The Factotum was introducted in <em>Dungeonscape</em> as a deliberate Jack of All Trades character class, with access to every skill, a decent base attack bonus, some spells, and, at higher levels, the ability to copy <em>class features</em> from other classes. The problem with multiclassing is often that either the abilities have no synergy or, perhaps more problematically, that everything comes from different ability scores (melee from Strength, ranged from Dexterity, magic from Intelligence or Wisdom, etc), which nobody can max out all of. They solved at least the latter problem for this class by tying almost <em>everything</em> to Intelligence.
</li><li> The Mystic Theurge is, somewhat ironically, the most balanced option between a Cleric and a Wizard. In order to qualify without using special feats or Prestige Class combinations (the Ur-Priest provides divine spellcasting of its own progression up to 9th level spells within ten levels, and is thus eligible for progression on the divine spellcasting side of the Mystic Theurge), a given character will need to lose a minimum of three caster levels (and thus spell level access) on both the arcane and divine side of the progression. Since the number of prestige classes that offer dual progression in this fashion is limited (and often more restricted), he will then need to choose between the highest spell level access on one side rather than the other, and lose some staying power on the process compared to a caster dedicated to one side or the other. In addition, it requires two high mental stats to use efficiently, balancing out its versatility (unless you go sorcerer/favored soul or wizard/archivist). (It IS possible to obtain both 9th arcane and divine levels AND do so with a single casting stat, but not both at the same time.)
</li><li> Rangers. They have decent damage capacity with their archery and two-weapon fighting feats, they can take a few hits and dodge a few hits, they get enough skill points to cover utility roles like scouting, tracking, or determining information, and they can cast enough spells to fill out occasional roles. None of their abilities truly beat a specialist, but they can perform adequately at most jobs and they have enough alternate class features that making variations is pretty easy. Most tier lists place them in the very middle of the list.
</li><li> Binders are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiformBalance">Multiform Balance</a> variant of this. Their signature trait is being able to bind spirits to themselves that allow them to fulfill pretty much any potential role decently, including blasting, melee or ranged combat, tanking, stealth, healing, social skills, battlefield control, or buffing and debuffing. Binders can also spec into vastly different roles through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Classes</a>, such as becoming a Knight of the Sacred Seal to become a better warrior, or an Anima Mage to be a better caster. One of the vestiges, Naberius, allows them to use any skill as if they were trained in it, but doesn't provide any bonus to it.
</li><li> The Incarnate fits into a similar category. By the nature of their soulmeld system, they can fulfill many potential roles admirably, or even switch up their skills round to round between casting, melee, and skill use.
</li><li> In 4th Edition and D&amp;D Essentials, Bards qualify in a way, since they get training in an insane number of skills and one build in Essentials even starts with Jack Of All Trades, giving them +2 to all skills they're not already trained in... which, by the way, stacks with all other Skill-Bonuses! It's not uncommon to have a Level 1 Bard with an average Skill Bonus of more than +10 due to this. Too bad 4.0-Bards are the least useful class in combat. Everything they can do, other classes can do better. But in Skill Challenges, you'll want a Bard, or at least, you'll want to a Multiclass Bard-Whatever.
</li><li> Bards also fulfill this role in 5th Edition. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knights</a>, Bards can use light armour and a few martial weapons to give them passable (but not exceptional) capability in melee or ranged, and also use their Magical Secrets class feature to pilfer spells from <em>other classes' spell lists</em>. Sword and Valour Bards can gain medium armour and shield proficiency to become more capable in the frontline (though not quite as good as the dedicated martial classes), while the Lore Bard can get bonus proficiencies in skills and Additional Magical Secrets to round out their array of support, debuff and damage spells. On top of all that, their "Jack of All Trades" class feature allows them to add half their Proficiency bonus to any check or ability <em>they aren't already</em> proficient in, including some checks that can't get bonuses normally, like Initiative and the Counterspell spell. Once considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> joke, Bards have never been more powerful and versatile.
</li><li> Competing with Bards for 5E's most versatile class is Clerics - though Jack of <em>Any</em> Trade might be a more fitting title. All Clerics can use simple weapons, shields and light and medium armour. Clerics can choose from one of <em>ten</em> different Domains (to represent the god they have dedicated themselves to) and fulfil any party role: A War or Forge domain Cleric can throw down in the frontline just like any "real" martial character, wear heavy armour and wallop an enemy in close; a Knowledge domain Cleric can have an impressive array of skills and specialised knowledge; an Arcana or Light domain Cleric can pack enough magical firepower to give a Sorcerer or Warlock a run for their money; a Trickery domain Cleric has a potent illusion magical toolbox to give the party Rogue a buddy on a sneaking mission; and while all Clerics are capable healers, <em>nobody</em> comes remotely close to the Life Cleric. And unlike most other spellcaster classes, Clerics know <em>their entire spell list</em> right off the bat and only have to choose which spells to prepare every day, a spell list that also happens to have a lot of spells with good variety.

<ul><li> With its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> of D&amp;D 3.75 it unsurprisingly also has humans as the Jack race. They gain a +2 bonus to one stat of the player's choice, making humans as viable as any race in their field. Half-elves and Half-orcs were modified to make them Jack races as well. Bards and Inquisitors are both Jack classes, with Bards receiving upgrades to make them much more useful than they were in D&amp;D 2-3. Bards in D&amp;D 1 worked in a completely different manner.
</li><li> The Pathfinder Rogue class is very much a jack-of-all trades class, with a variety of special abilities which can grant it minor spellcasting, extra feats, etc.
</li><li> The Pathfinder Magus class. Though not as strong in direct combat as a fighter or as good a spellcaster as a wizard, it can do both fairly well being able to attack, do some battlefield control, some stealth. Normally, a fighter-caster has to choose between fighting and casting in any given round meaning their diluted abilities make them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> and many spellcasting classes can't cast in armor but a Magus can cast in armor and can attack and cast spells in the same around (with a few drawbacks). The can also augment their magical weapons temporarily to help make up for their lack of combat prowess relative to fighters.

<ul><li> The Space Marines. Their 5th Edition Codex allows you to create almost any type of list you want. Want to head a small army of elite warriors? Take Terminators and Land Raiders. Want to lead a fully mechanized force? Put everything in Rhinos/Razorbacks. Like close combat? So do your Assault Marines. Prefer to shoot the enemy off the table? They have an app for that. Want to be a sneaky git? Take some Veterans and Infiltrate like a boss.
</li><li> Within the Imperial Guard, this is the Cadian's hat. Cadian regiments focus more on discipline and tactical versatility than regiments from other worlds. A Cadian armoured regiment won't be better than the Armaggeddon Steel Legion, and a Cadian close-quarters guerilla regiment won't be better than the Catachan Jungle Fighters or the Tanith First and Only, but you won't see those forces being fielded as <em>anything else</em>. The Cadian way of fighting war is pretty much the Imperial standard.
</li><li> Eldar Dire Avengers are reasonably well-armoured (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">for Eldar</a>), decent at shooting and passable at melee. Other Aspect Warriors are highly specialised towards one kind of war - Fire Dragons are for blowing up fortifications and are atrocious at ighting everything else, Dark Reapers mow down even the heavily armoured Space Marines but can't melee for shit, and Swooping Hawks are good for hit-n-run tactics but die when the enemy sneezes on them.

House Orlock gang members get access to the Combat, Ferocity, and Shooting skill trees, allowing for individual fighters to be either ranged or melee combatants, or some combination of both. House Orlock isn't the best at any of those areas, as other more specialized gangs get Combat, Ferocity, and Shooting skill trees that focused on one stat or ther other to get skills that Orlock's skill trees can't get. However, this also means House Orlock gang members can never be really caught off-guard, since they're flexible and good at everything (even without being the best), allowing House Orlock to exploit more glaring weaknesses in the other gangs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Rifts">Rifts</a></em>, much like D&amp;D, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage">Humans</a> as the Jack-Of-All-Stats. They are the only class who rolls the same number of die (3D6) for every attribute, and get no special skills or abilities to start off with. Their only advantages are that they have almost no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterClass">O.C.C.</a> restrictions (only O.C.C.s made for a specific race are unavailable for them), and that if they roll a 16, 17, or 18 on an attribute roll, they get to roll a bonus die.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BloodBowl">Blood Bowl</a></em>, most races' linemen have the standard stat spread of 6 MV, 3 St, 3 Ag, 7-8 AV, and no inherent skills. On an 'individual models' level, Amazons are the closest to this trope as *all* their models have the above stat block (7 AV) and the dodge skill. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreAverage">Empire teams</a> fulfil this on a team level, being good if not great at all strategies (running, throwing and blocking), but their individual models have some deviations from the baseline and they have a Big Guy (the ogre).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles">Star Fleet Battles</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">Orion Pirates</a>, who have ships that range from the unremarkable to the rather flimsy, but do have two potentially devastating advantages (if used correctly): They can double engine power (at the cost of engine damage), and they can switch out some of their weapons for whatever is best for the target at hand. They aren't really much good at anything (except raiding minimally armed freighters), but you can get away with being mediocre if you can be mediocre at something your enemy can't handle at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> has this in medium 'Mechs, being neither the strongest nor the fastest, but providing enough of both to mean something. Some designs are basic all-rounders useful for almost any purpose and several 'Mechs are considered troopers, that is, able to fit into almost any lance assignment decently enough. In the early days of the franchise, the <em>Wolverine</em> was considered a trooper medium 'Mech, possessing a basic but capable array of weapons for long and short range combat, respectable armor, and decent speed and agility. As a result it could fill most roles with reasonable competence. It was fast enough to do well in scout troops, but was still tough enough to be found alongside heavier forces as support, or even on the line of battle. While it did not excel at any particular area, its utility was such that it became one of the best medium-weight choices of the era. Contrast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> <em>Shadow Hawk</em>, which was the same size and even shared a few weapons with the <em>Wolverine</em> yet did not compare in overall capability.

Takeru, the main character, brings up how some works of fiction have a team of specialists that all have a certain role to fill. He's told that's a horrible idea in an actual war, as the death of one person can very easily spell death for the rest of them if the thing they're supposed to deal with comes up. It's then stated that having a squad of soldiers who can instead do everything well is better, since the team doesn't fall apart when only one person dies.

Despite mastering 1000 ninjutsu due to his Sharingan, he's not the best in any element or clone use, and he's not the smartest (Shikamaru and Shikaku are smarter, Minato goes without saying), but he's got a balance of all these skills to be one of Konoha's best (if not <em>the</em> best) Jonin, Hokage Candidate, third general of the Fourth Shinobi World War, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">AND the Sixth Hokage.</span>

They aren't the best in any one field, but they have no weaknesses and that makes them very proficient fighters. In-universe, Byakuya has been implied to be an all-rounder and both Aizen and Yamamoto have been stated to be all-rounders, in fact defeating Yamamoto's extraordinary proficiency in all areas becomes Aizen's overriding strategy when facing him in battle.

Whereas Kakashi specializes in ninjutsu, Guy in taijutsu and Kurenai in genjutsu, Asuma is "second best at everything".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OfMaresAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OfMaresAndMagic">Of Mares And Magic</a></em>, Trixie fits this role. She's better than Twilight at magic that requires dexterity and a showy flair, but not as good at it as Rarity. On the flip side, she can't match Twilight's raw power, but is considerably stronger than Rarity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheBridge">The Bridge</a></em> presents the grown up Godzilla Junior as this amongst the kaiju. He's reasonably fast, but slower than Rodan; he's quite durable, but less so than Anguirus; he's very strong, but Destroyah is stronger; and he has a powerful projectile attack, but Mothra Lea has better. However, he's far stronger than Rodan, has a much better projectile than Anguirus, is much more durable than Mothra; and is faster than Destroyah. It's implied this is why he's one of the most powerful kaiju of all time, having no real exploitable shortcomings.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPOVSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PonyPOVSeries">Pony POV Series</a></em>, Elements of Magic have this. They can perform any spell and copy them fairly easily, but ultimately a pony with a special talent in the area of such a spell will be better than them at it. Of course the trade off is they're much more varied overall. The exception seems to have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Queen majesty</a>, who was immensely powerful and capable of a broad variety of magic.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PrincessOfTheBlacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PrincessOfTheBlacks">Princess of the Blacks</a></em>, Soul Mages like Voldemort can perform any type of black magic but not as well as specialized black wizard (i.e. they can perform necromancy but not as well as a dedicated necroancer). Their real strength is combining forms of black magic such as using flesh crafting and necromancy to make an army of chimeric zombies.

His claws give him mobility and considerable offensive ability against humans, but he still doesn't hold a candle to Bakugou or Todoroki. His scales can protect him from minor scratches and shrapnel, but he's nowhere near as tough as Kirishima. His ability to detect heat signatures helps him dodge attacks more easily, but it's not as great for scanning as Jirou's Earphone Jacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Nutricula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Nutricula">Nutricula</a></em>: Izuku has several powers similar to other students, though weaker. His explosions are less versatile than Bakugou's, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a> is slower than Iida, his hardening only covers his head unlike Kirishima, and his temperature control is less powerful than Todoroki's. But combined with his other powers, Izuku has a power for nearly any situation he might face.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AmazingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AmazingFantasy">Amazing Fantasy</a>,</em> Izuku's spider-based powerset makes him this in 1-A. He's the physically strongest in class, but lacks the widespread destructive ability of Bakugou and Todoroki. He's superhumanly fast, but still outpaced by Iida. He's tough enough to take continual beatdowns, but not bulletproof like Kirishima. He's stealthy, but not outright invisible like Hagakure. His Venom Strike is a powerful tool for subduing foes, but it lacks the same usability, range, and power as Kaminari's Electrification.

Since the others just happen to have stats that reflect their real characters (Cat is The Riviera Kid, with a high Charm, but low Intelligence, for example), this may indicate that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Everyman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Everyman">Everyman</a> Lister is himself the Jack-Of-All-Stats. It may also have represented Lister's mental state: personal hygiene issues aside, he's the most content with who he is out of the main cast. Compared to the Cat's vanity and Rimmer's insecurity, his only delusion is that he can play the guitar (he really can't).
</li><li> Heisei-era <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a> series tend to make the starring Riders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyHero">Swiss Army Heroes</a>, and their default forms are usually the most balanced ones. Some series feature lots of Riders rather than lots of versions of a single Rider, but the title characters are still the most balanced ones of the ensemble.
<ul><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO">Kamen Rider OOO</a></em> due to his extensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">Combo Platter Powers</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDrive">Kamen Rider Drive</a></em> is another series where the main form isn't actually a balanced one; as Drive's default is Type Speed, a speedster whose attack capability is decent but lower than all his other forms.

</li><li> Starfleet ships in general in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> universe are said to be middle ground on a lot of things. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation">The Federation</a> prefers an image of being explorers, so while the typical Starfleet ship is well armed they also have space for emergency relief, scientific surveys and diplomatic missions. The Galaxy class is functionally a moving city, with families on board, plenty of recreation space and an arboretum. After the Borg attack, Starfleet started skewing their ship designs a little more utilitarian and combat ready, with the Sovereign class a militarized update of the Galaxy class.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aang can control all 4 elements, but he is only a master of airbending, as he is the last one alive. He is still a child and new to all 3 other forms of bending (the entire series taking place over about 3/4 of a year). Once he has had more time to practice and master them, it is expected that he will in fact be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfAll">Master of All</a> and capable of outshining individuals from any school in their own specialty. While Toph and Katara both demonstrate mastery of their own schools which may edge out Aang at times, they have both been focused on just one bending practice while Aang has to juggle multiple forms. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Avatar State</a> he can overcome just about any conventional bender, but by the end of the series it's explicitly said that he is exceptional at Waterbending but only novice at Firebending, while his Earthbending "could use some work".
</li><li> His successor, Korra of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> is this as well, proficient in three elements (all four since the Book 1 finale) but lacking access to advanced and specialized techniques like metalbending, bloodbending, or lightning generation. This seems to be par the course for Avatars in general; they're expected to master all the elements, but they have a lifetime in which to do it, meaning they take some time to reach mastery of all of them.
</li></ul></li><li> Optimus Prime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> tends to be a mid-sized robot in a franchise that has characters vary from appliances to battleships (and some planet-sized), but his tenacity and nobility lets him pound the typically much larger Megatron almost every time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a>,</em> Yumi's Lyoko avatar doesn't quite have Odd's range, Ulrich's close-combat superiority, or Aelita's ability to manipulate the environment, but can preform reasonably well in all three areas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sunset Shimmer is contrasted with Twilight Sparkle (especially in the expanded universe) as this. Both of them are highly talented mages and students of Princess Celestia, and both excel academically. Sunset Shimmer however is also athletic, musically talented and confident socially, all things Twilight has been shown to struggle with. The human Twilight (and almost certainly Pony Twilight) was shown to be more intelligent overall however, and ironically Sunset Shimmer has also repeatedly been tripped up by her own self reliance and unwillingness to trust in others.
</li><li> Twilight herself is working towards this, now being able to fly, having developed her physical talents and progressing as a leader and socialiser. Shes still most reliant on her smarts and magic however.
</li><li> Rarity is also very balanced, being capable of magic, smart and roundedly atheletic, but not nearly as capable in any of these areas as one of the others. Her main talents are her charisma and attention to detail, in which she does excel.

His 10 sisters will generally be better at everything than he is, from leadership and music to intelligence and creativity. However he is acceptable at all their skills and can perform well at any of these skills when it is necessary.

It was to be a carbine under one meter in length and three kilograms in weight, chambered in a high-caliber round like .308 Winchester or 7mm-08 Remington (with .243 Winchester recommended as an alternative for younger or smaller shooters, albeit only with a 22-inch barrel), and capable of putting down a four-inch group on a target from 200 meters away. A 2x or 3x telescoping scope was optional, but recommended, paired with ghost ring iron sights in case the scope was damaged; said scope was to be forward-mounted to increase peripheral vision, make it easier to clear jams, allow the loading of rounds from a stripper clip (in a bolt-action rifle), and make it so that the recoil wouldn't push the scope into the shooter's face.
