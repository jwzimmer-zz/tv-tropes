</p><p>Sometimes the scene is shown again the exact same way as it was shown the first time, with the only difference being the audience's new understanding of what it meant. Sometimes the scene is extended or re-shot from a different perspective to show the newly-revealed meaning. A frequent variation of this happens during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">reveal</a> that a character's perception of an event has been altered by a hallucination or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a>: the first appearance of the scene is from the character's point of view, but once the audience discovers that's not what really happened, the scenes are shown again, but replaced with the truth.

Also see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">Rewatch Bonus</a>, the times you see these important points upon reviewing prior scenes without the author's help. If the reinterpretation is made immediately (by changing the camera field), it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealShot">Reveal Shot</a>.
</p><p>Used clumsily, this will be seen as obvious and unnecessary. The gun she's using is the one her father was killed with? Yeah, considering its unique look, we gathered as much when we saw it for the first time in both scenes. Now could we please end the flashback and get on with the story?
</p><p>This trope can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">How We Got Here</a>, but the emphasis is slightly different. How We Got Here usually starts the entire story with a single dramatic situation (like the heroes pointing handguns at each other) and then explains <em>how</em> things got to that point. Once More With Clarity often repeats more than one scene, and they can be superficially unremarkable at first, until they are imbued with more meaning or emotion once the viewer understands <em>what</em> they mean. It can also overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">In Medias Res</a>, but only if the first showing of the scene is the opening scene, and the content of the scene remains the same in all showings.

When we see what happened from Koro-sensei's perspective, he was actually swearing an oath on her blood to watch over Class 3-E in her place</span>.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> contains a collection of several scenes that make no sense. In the final episodes those scenes are played again and it's then clear that they show what happened to the characters at the end of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">arcs</a>. Except for one scene, which is from a book that wasn't even adapted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em>: At the start of the Royal Knights Tournament, Zora is introduced by attacking the Vice Captain of the Purple Orcas for no apparent reason and showing a deep unexplained hatred for Magic Knights. When his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> is revealed, as well as the fact that he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Vigilante Man</a>, that scene is played again from a few minutes prior, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Vice Captain was about to attack and possibly kill an old lady who bothered him by begging for help to find her missing granddaughter. Zora defended the old lady attacking the Vice Captain</span>.
</li><li> Again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElCazadorDeLaBruja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElCazadorDeLaBruja">El Cazador de la Bruja</a></em>, the first flashback of Dr. Schneider's death is framed in such a way as to imply that Ellis' powers went out of control and killed him (which is what she believes). The full flashback, however, reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was actually shot by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Rosenberg, while Ellis was trying to control her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CoffinPrincessChaika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CoffinPrincessChaika">Coffin Princess Chaika</a></em>:
<ul><li> The very first scene of the anime is what appears to be a shocked-looking Chaika Trabant conversing with a strange being. In Episode 11, we see the scene again, revealing it was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Layla/Blue Chaika instead, and that the scene was in fact her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, as she learned from the creature that the Chaikas were mere tools to gather Emperor Gaz's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">remains</a>.</span>
</li><li> The final shots of <em>Avenging Battle</em>'s ending sequence are of a cherry tree with two blurry figures visible in the distance, and then a small country house. These shots seem unconnected to the main plot, but in the final episode, the first shot is unblurred to reveal that it carries on from the show's final scene, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Toru and the recovering Chaika making their way back from the tree towards the house in the second shot, which the viewer now knows is where they, Akari, Fredrica and Red Chaika live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> when Ryuk talks with Light, telling him that humans who use the Death Note do not go to Heaven or Hell, and that Light will find out when he dies. Light, right before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his death near the end of the series</span>, correctly guesses that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ryuk said that because all humans, whether they used the Death Note or not, simply experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">Cessation of Existence</a> upon the end of their lives</span>. This is averted in the manga, where Light says it in response instantly.
</li><li> The last scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> is a scene from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> where Kiritsugu tells his son, Shirou, that he wanted to be a hero when he was a child. Seeing it in flashback reveals quite a bit about Shriou's motivation but seeing it at the end of <em>Fate/Zero</em> with a different soundtrack after discovering Kiritsugu's back story turns it from simple characterization to one of the most heart warming and hopeful scenes in the entire series (even with Kiritsugu basically dying at the same time).
</li><li> Used to great effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> when Mustang kills <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Maria Ross</span>. The audience is treated to a short scene in which Mustang appears and speaks briefly before snapping his fingers - then the actual explosion is shown from a distance. The scene is shown again later in an extended format, and shows Mustang <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bringing out the fake corpse he created with alchemy, burning it, and rescuing Ross instead</span>.
</li><li> The opening thirty seconds of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary">Future Diary</a></em> make no sense upon first viewing, especially since the poor lighting makes it impossible to tell who anyone is. When the scenes are shown again during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>, the lighting and camera angles are changed and the scenes are now revealed to depict <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">World 1 Yukkii and Yuno's failed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidePact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidePact">Suicide Pact</a>, which left Yuno as the winner of that world's survival game</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">World 1 Yuno killing World 2 Yuno in order to assume her identity</span>.
</li><li> The flashback scenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GiantRobo">Giant Robo</a>: The Animation</em> are chock full of this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By the end of the film, they've completely rewritten who the villain is</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDiversReRise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildDiversReRise">Gundam Build Divers Re:RISE</a></em> episode one, we see Hiroto, Kazami, May and Parviz finding a mysterious dialogue box and agree to its conditions after the person on the other side, Freddie, begs for their help. In episode 14, we see what would drive Freddie to bring them over.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em>: This happens several times during the series; the biggest example would be Meakashi-hen, which is an earlier arc, replayed from the perspective of the villain (however, it should be noted that this arc's timeline is completely separate from that of Watanagashi-hen, rather the set up and events are nearly identical). This also happens during the arc after this, when Keiichi remembers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing Mion and Rena during Onikakushi-hen</span>, and that it <em>wasn't</em> a syringe, but a marker, and that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rena</span> begged for him to trust her up until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he landed the final blow</span>. This also happens to Satoko during Minagoroshi-hen when she remembers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">pushing her parents over the cliff herself,</span> an incident that had previously been shown as an accident, with Satoko well out of the way.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/K">K</a></em>, a montage of this sort is shown when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shiro's true identity and the Colorless King's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">abilities</a> </span>are revealed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KagerouProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KagerouProject">Kagerou Project</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MekakucityActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MekakucityActors">The series' whole anime adaptation</a> counts as one of these, as it puts major events from the songs, novels and manga into order, shows things that had only been hinted at before, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gives a conclusive ending</span>. It's even lampshaded in the first scene when Ayano<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">/The Retaining Eyes Snake in disguise</span> tells a confused Shintaro that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">"Everyone's going through this, realising it bit by bit"</a> and proceeds to tell him "The story once again, of how we met".
</li><li> Early on in the series, Shintaro is caught up in some sort of heist at a shopping mall, only for the criminals to get mysteriously picked off one by one before the Mekakushi-dan reveal themselves. The scene is later shown again from the Mekakushi-dan's perspective, showing exactly how they did it.
</li><li> This also happens on a smaller scale with the PVs for <em>Children Record</em> and <em>Days</em>. The former shows a scene of Azami, smiling against a dark background, implying she will play a villainous role. The <em>Days</em> PV shows the scene again, only this time it's against a bright background, and the context makes it clear that she's smiling because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her granddaughter and her friends finally broke the cycle and ended everyone's suffering</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Near the end of the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LegendOfGalacticHeroes">Legend of Galactic Heroes</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(even inside a spoiler tag one should know this is a huge spoiler), protagonist Yang Wen-Li dies leaving his foster sun, Julian, as his successor to carry on the battle against Kaiser Reinhard. Throughout this season the ending theme showed Yang and all his friends enjoying a quite life while Julian watched a video with a solemn expression. However in the last episode of the season after everyone comes to terms with Yang's death, the ending sequence changes to the one that was used in the first season. The first season's ending theme ends with Yang moving out of focus leaving Julian to share the screen with Reinhard. Why Julian and Reinhard shared this imagery no doubt confused viewers during the first season as Julian was a relatively minor character but when shown again over eighty episodes after it is first used, it perfectly set the tone for the rest of the series</span>.
</li><li> In Episode 15 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon">Log Horizon</a></em>, Isuzu tries to add Rudy to her friends list, but it doesn't work. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rudy is killed during the goblin invasion</span>, the scene is shown again, but this time with the revelation that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rudy is a Person of the Land (i.e. an NPC)</span>, hence why the friend request didn't work. There's also a flashback of Rudy training in the forest, as we now realize that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>had</em> to work that hard in order to overcome the limitations of being an NPC</span>.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Madlax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Madlax">Madlax</a></em> gradually expands Margaret and Madlax's flashbacks of what really happened between them twelve years ago, eventually revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the former is the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">Literal Split Personality</a></span>.
</li><li> Emotional example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MarginalNumber4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MarginalNumber4">Marginal #4</a></em> - the show begins with the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">idol unit</a>'s debut, with them preparing right before they go on stage. Episode 9 is mostly a flashback to when they first formed - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">they didn't get along at first</a>, and the flashback shows how they learned to use their differences as a strength instead of a weakness, and become incredibly close friends. The end of episode 9 shows the same scene from the beginning (but with different music) and the emotion is completely different once you've seen the work that led up to it.
</li><li> The scene where Kobayashi and Tohru meet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em> is shown three times. The first time in chapter 2 only shows Tohru in dragon form and with only the loosest amount of details (since Kobayashi is still suffering from a hangover while remembering it). The second time in chapter 32 shows it in much greater detail, such as why Kobayashi got so drunk, the sword wound on Tohru's back, and the full scope of the conversation that went down while Tohru is in human form. Then it's visited a third time in chapter 58 when the reader finally sees the circumstances behind how and why Tohru was wounded.

We later see that it was Bonaparta reaching out to Nina telling her that she and Johan must not become monsters.
</li><li> In one of the earliest chapters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, Sasuke explains that his life ambition is to kill a certain person (out of revenge) and we see a distinctive, shadowed picture of said person's face. Hundreds of chapters later, we see the face (in the exact same angle) again, as Sasuke remembers that fateful night with new clarity, and realizes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Itachi was crying out of remorse, because he massacred the Uchiha Clan (except his brother) to preserve peace and prevent a world war, and decided to take the blame for it all</span>.

<ul><li> We first see Ace joining Whitebeard's crew as a battered and worn down Ace is approached by Whitebeard and offered a place in his crew. This, combined with Ace's fierce loyalty to his captain suggests that Whitebeard found and took in a down-on-his-luck Ace. When we see the flashback again, we see that Ace was a successful enough pirate to be considered for the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and his beating came from <em>Whitebeard</em> kicking his ass when he sought out said Yonkou to kick <em>his</em> ass in order to claim the title of "Pirate King".
</li><li> In chapter 721, we are shown Rebecca's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> with the Toy Soldier. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">We are shown Kyros's past in chapter 742, with many of the scenes in Rebecca's past altered to include him in them. The reason why he doesn't show up in Rebecca's memories is because Kyros was turned into the Toy Soldier, and the side effect is that everyone who ever knew him (or even knew <em>of</em> him) forgot his existence entirely. As a result of this, Rebecca is unaware that the Toy Soldier is really her father, and was never told because doing so would cause him to be tossed into the scrap heap and leave her without protection.</span>

He also happened to meet said three women who became his Social Links, had to pay for a toy that wasn't broken in the first place and borrowed Teddie's costume for the day care.

The rest of the volume shows Marilène willingly married first a noble and then a mercenary who both usurped the throne from the rightful heir. All indications are she only wants to maintain her status as queen and the father-in-law was furious at her for this. The end of the volume reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marilène loved the kingdom and her dead husband; she wed the two men in order to act as a moderating influence and reduce the damage the people suffered.

</li><li> The first chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SukiXSuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SukiXSuki">Suki × Suki</a></em> shows Touka wishing she could just disappear after having a difficult time talking to Ryoutarou, the boy she likes, because she keeps going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> around him. The next morning, she wakes up invisible and, upon realizing nobody can see or hear her, gleefully exploits the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">Power Perversion Potential</a> and uses her invisibility to be close to Ryoutarou without his awareness. The second chapter shows the first chapter from Ryoutarou's viewpoint, which includes the fact that he alone can see <em>everything</em> Touka does while invisible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> did this very interestingly - in the final episode, Tenchi finally demands to know how his mom died.

As the story grows more and more elaborate, he stops himself and reveals the truth: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tenchi's mom was a horrible prankster who made even her death one big joke and even wrote a <em>script</em> that was to be read about her passing</span>.

<ul><li> Heartland Invasion:
<ul><li> Episode 18: From Yuto's POV, he is dueling a guy on a D-Wheel in a ruined city that looks suspiciously like Heartland.
</li><li> Episode 34: From Kurosaki's POV, we see what appears to be a city in flames, and Sora refers to the event as a "hunting game".
</li><li> Episode 36: Once again from Yuto's POV, it's confirmed that it <em>is</em> Heartland, and this time we see the invaders themselves - Academia student-soldiers - and still shots of people turned into cards.
</li><li> Episode 47: The same scene happens from Yugo's POV, revealing that he was present during the invasion, added with showing on-screen the entire carding process.
</li><li> Episode 50: Yuto's POV, same scene, but the Academia students are <em>laughing</em>.
</li><li> Episode 74: The Academia students used Antique Gear Chaos Giants to wreck the city, forcing the survivors to sneak around the ruins.
</li><li> Episode 100: We see exactly how the invasion <em>started</em>, with the students carding a young couple and their <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">infant child</a></strong></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Ruri's kidnapping:
<ul><li> In the same flashback as episode 18, after Yugo cuts off the duel and drives off, Kurosaki shows up and asks Yuto where Ruri is, to which he shakes his head.
</li><li> Episode 36: Yuto blames Yugo for Ruri's kidnapping, but Yugo then accuses Yuto that "he took something precious from him".
</li><li> Episode 48: The real kidnapper was a guy named Yuri, and along with Ruri he took a girl named Rin.
</li><li> Episode 54: We see the same flashback from Yugo's POV - not only we see Rin's kidnapping in detail, but we also see that Yugo saw Yuri - which explains how he confused him for Yuto, as they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">Identical Strangers</a> - and then Clear Wing teleported him to Heartland. Then we see Yuri hiding behind sone building while Yuto and Yugo were duking it out.
</li><li> Episode 74: We see the kidnapping from Dennis's POV; he approached Ruri before the invasion, revealed that him finding her was the signal for green-lighting it in the first place, he pointed Yuri to Ruri, and the Yuri cornered Ruri in an alley and dueled her.
</li><li> Episode 105: We see the scene above again from Sayaka's POV, revealing that she saw the kidnapping but was too terrified to help.

The first memory they see shows him punch out his superior officer and roar that he quits. Sinestro is disgusted and "pauses" the "footage", saying Hal is obviously unfit to be a Green Lantern before storming out of the room. Tomar Re has a little more faith and plays the memory again. It turns out that the superior officer was sexually harassing a girl. Hal stopped him and quit because he could not possibly work for such a scumbag.

The author advises readers to reread the story with the new content in mind.

In the next chapter, we learn that the only reason he was looking at them was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so he could wrap an infinitely thin metal thread around their necks and <em>pull</em></span>. Due to time travel, several of these happen across the story. The only one we don't get this for is the one where Harry tries to make his future self solve a math problem and send the solution back to him.

The reason she passed out is unknown, but it is implied to have something to do with her having found something in a nearby room with blood on the floor. Later, this scene is revealed to have been a flashforward to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the beginning of Chapter 1's Deadly Life</span>. The scene is repeated word-for-word, only now with the context of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hana having just discovered the body of Mikio Nakamura and passing out in the hallway due to the shock and horror</span>.

In a sense, it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked Trope</a>, as Detective Nicky Flippers is questioning them in order to get to the bottom of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">how the four of them ended up in the situation they were found in</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LovingVincent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LovingVincent">Loving Vincent</a></em>, several scenes are repeated and made more clear from another's perspective. For instance, some in Auvers assume Vincent and Dr. Gachet quarreled over Vincent's friendship with Marguerite - but the doctor later reveals the fight was over his own artistic pretensions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MeetTheRobinsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MeetTheRobinsons">Meet the Robinsons</a></em>, the opening scene shows baby Lewis being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorstopBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorstopBaby">left on the doorstep of an orphanage</a>. At one point the mother hears somebody behind her, but turns to see nobody there; then we cut to the inside of the orphanage as somebody is knocking on the door. Near the end of the movie we learn that the person the mother heard, and the one who knocked, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Traveling</a> twelve-year-old Lewis, ultimately deciding not to confront his birth mother and change history</span>.

Near the end of the film it is revealed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThroughTheEyesOfMadness">characters' and audience's perception was distorted to make everything seem bigger and scarier than it really was</a>. As the characters travel back home, the audience then gets to see what many of the places they had gone through actually looked like. For example, a dark forest of giant thorns and carnivorous plants was actually a beautiful rose garden.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PussInBoots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PussInBoots">Puss in Boots</a></em> has a humorous version of this, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s identity</span> being accompanied by several shots of previous scenes, revealing that he was present in each one to increasingly absurd degrees.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Zootopia</a></em>, when Judy overhears one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> talking about how he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had shot Emmitt Otterton with the serum</span>, the audience is treated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevealShot">Reveal Shots</a> showing how both Emmitt and Manchas were targeted; the latter is a quintessential example of the trope, since it shows something the audience was deliberately kept from seeing the first time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(the panther getting shot through the window, previously blocked by the closed door)</span>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder4');">    Film  Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder4" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is a staple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherNolan">Christopher Nolan</a> films:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento">Memento</a></em> pretty much runs on this trope due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToFront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToFront">reverse chronology</a>: the end of each scene establishes the context of the previous scene. The most notable use of this is when Natalie walks in bruised, and tells Leonard she was attacked by a man named Dodd. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She'd actually goaded Leonard into hitting her, then walked out, waited for him to forget what had happened, and walked back in again.</span>
</li><li> The opening scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> makes no sense the first time you see it. It's played again later in the film, at which point all becomes perfectly clear. (Or as clear as this film ever makes anything, anyway; it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">that kind of film</a>). Fairly early on in the film, there is a scene of Cobb and Mal walking through Limbo together, holding hands. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's shown once more near the ending, during Cobb's final confrontation with Mal's shade. When she reminds him that he promised they'd grow old together, he simply says "But we did, don't you remember?" The scene from the beginning then plays again... with the Cobb and Mal we're familiar with replaced by significantly older versions.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em> has the story of Bane's escape from a nightmarish prison he grew up in. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out he was not the one who escaped, it was Talia Al Ghul and Bane was her protector. The child shown in the flashback has no discernible gender, so it's easy to just assume it's a boy.</span>
</li><li> The early parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Interstellar">Interstellar</a></em> are spliced in with interviews with elderly people, supposedly on how life was during the Clutch Plague and 1930s Dust Bowl. The ending scenes reveal that those interviews were part of a museum exhibit on a space station about the early parts of the film, which are set in the future.

</li><li> Happens frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Atonement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Atonement">Atonement</a></em> to show Briony's misinterpretation of the events that occur.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBalladOfBusterScruggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBalladOfBusterScruggs">The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</a></em>: Each short film in the anthology is preceding by an illustration and caption of something that happens in the story. Once the moment comes in the story, the viewer has all the context, and the illustration makes sense.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsExcellentAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BillAndTedsExcellentAdventure">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure</a></em>, the eponymous time-travellers meet their one-day-older selves and have a brief conversation. Later in the film, we see the same conversation again from the older versions' point of view. The characters even comment that it made a lot more sense the second time.
</li></ul><ul><li> The opening scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarlitosWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CarlitosWay">Carlito's Way</a></em> is repeated at the end, and you realize that the first scene means almost exactly the opposite of what you thought.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CateBlanchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CateBlanchett">Cate Blanchett</a> lampshades this while talking in the behind-the-scenes features for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carol">Carol</a></em>. The first scene is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMediasRes">near the end of the timeline of the movie</a>. As seen from a minor character's view, it's a relatively benign, if chilly, dinner between two gal pals. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When you see it again, knowing the depth and intensity of Carol and Therese's affair, the awkwardness becomes tension charging the air like a lightning rod.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clue">Clue</a></em> devotes the entire last half of the movie to a protracted rehashing of the first half. It's still awesome.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheConversation">The Conversation</a></em>, a surveillance expert investigates a recorded conversation between two suspects. The meaning of the conversation changes radically as he discovers more information. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Specifically, the difference between "He'd <em>kill</em> us if he got the chance" and "<em>He'd</em> kill <em>us</em> if he got the chance".</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cyborg1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cyborg1989">Cyborg (1989)</a></em> has several short flashbacks throughout the film, showing how Gibson met his love interest and briefly retired from his life as a mercenary who fights bandits and pirates. Each one of these flashbacks, however, ends on an ominous note, hinting at the events that Fender, the leader of arguably the most vicious and evil pirate gang plaguing the world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>, did to Gibson that caused him to go after Fender in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>. When Gibson is in the middle of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Darkest Hour</a>, the prior flashbacks get played again, all together this time to form a narrative instead of disjointed hints and implications, and we finally get to see <em>exactly</em> what Fender did.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNote2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathNote2017">Death Note (2017)</a></em>: In the epilogue <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Light is in a hospital bed having just woken up from a coma. He explains to his father how he used the Death Note to save himself, cause Mia's death, absolve his name, retrieve the Death Note and get two more criminals killed along the way</span>.
</li><li> Kieslowski's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDecalogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDecalogue">Short Film About Love</a></em> combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book-Ends</a>. The opening scene shows someone's bandaged wrist, a hand reaching out to touch it, and third hand stopping it, but you have to watch the entire movie to find out why.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ExMachina">Ex Machina</a></em>, during one scene Caleb witnesses Nathan tearing up one of Ava's drawings on the security feed. Towards the climax of the film, Nathan shows Caleb the same footage again, but this time reveals that he'd torn the drawing up not out of genuine malice, but to subtly nudge Ava and Caleb towards plotting an escape, this being the true test of Ava's AI. Not only that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he had also surreptitiously installed a battery-proof camera into the room, allowing him to record what happens during the blackouts</span>, something neither Ava, Caleb, nor indeed the audience had noticed the first time round.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub">Fight Club</a></em>: During the reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the two main characters are the same person</span>, there is a series of flashbacks, some taking on new meaning, while others play out differently, showing how they <em>really</em> went down now that the viewer knows the secret.
</li><li> The first half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHandmaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHandmaiden">The Handmaiden</a></em> shows Sookee working together with Fujiwara to con Lady Hideko into marrying the latter. Then the second half of the film shows the events from Hideko's perspective and we learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not only was Sookee actually the one being conned by Fujiwara and Hideko, but she and Hideko eventually teamed up together to con Fujiwara</span>.
</li><li> The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hero">Hero</a></em> revolves around this, retelling the same story three times, the first being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">Nameless'</a> fake story, the second being the Emperor's take on what really happened, and the third finally revealing what actually happened. They even include a visual cue by having the characters wear different color-coded clothes in each retelling.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheBattleOfTheFiveArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheBattleOfTheFiveArmies">The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</a></em>, Bilbo Baggins is trying to fetch a particular gemstone which is being guarded by a dragon. When the dragon gets bored toying with Bilbo it tries to kill him, and Bilbo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">books it</a>; a flashback quite a while later reveals that he did indeed manage to snatch the gemstone as he was running.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz">Hot Fuzz</a></em> gets to do this more than once. Once with Sergeant Angel's proposed reasoning behind <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Simon Skinner</span> being behind the murders and then again with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the actual reasoning as explained by the real murderers, the entire Neighborhood Watch</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIllusionist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIllusionist">The Illusionist</a></em> depicts Inspector Uhl's concluding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> this way, with a montage of flashbacks to key moments from the investigation, intercut with shots of Uhl's amazement, awe, and eventual <em>applause</em> for what a feat of deception <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eisenheim and Sophie</span> pulled off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Incendies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Incendies">Incendies</a></em>: An early scene from Jeanne's point of view has her discover her mother, sitting catatonic on a lounge chair beside a pool. At the end of the film, we get the scene from the mother's point of view, revealing what happened just beforehand that left her in that state.
</li><li> A partial example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JudasKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JudasKiss">Judas Kiss</a></em>, in that the scenes had not actually been shown but had been alluded to by the characters. However, when the hideout is invaded by Senator Hornbeck's thugs, Coco has flashbacks to her actual conversations with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Junior</span> in planning the kidnapping. With the benefit of hindsight (and with the audience hearing the actual discussion for the first time), she realises that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Junior had been manipulating her the entire time to place her in a position where she would be forced to shoot Becky</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingsmanTheSecretService">Kingsman: The Secret Service</a></em>, Arthur invites Eggsy for a drink after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry's death</span>, and Eggsy asks a question about one of the paintings in the room, prompting Arthur to glance at over at and provide a short answer. Soon afterward a brief flash of the scene is shown again, but this time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eggsy is shown switching out their drinks while Arthur is distracted by the paintings</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Looper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Looper">Looper</a></em> does this in an interesting, roundabout way, befitting a movie all about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a>. First, we see Joe preparing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">close his loop</a>, only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">his future self</a> to appear unbound and escape, after which Joe returns to his apartment and is knocked out. The loop closing scene plays again, only this time Joe shoots his future self and we see the timeline play out like it was <em>supposed to</em>, with Joe retiring and spending 30 years in China before hes captured to be sent back in time. <em>Then</em>, we see the moment Old Joe decides to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> by fighting off his kidnappers and going back himself. At that point, the loop closing scene plays yet again, this time from Old Joes perspective, showing how he changed the past and made his way to Young Joes apartment.

He then awakens in Rethrick's office, with James tellin him, "Michael, you're done". Michael, of course, assumes he's talking about the 2-year job, which he no longer remembers. Later on, though, when he realizes Rethrick wants him dead, he flashbacks to that scene, and now "you're done" sounds <em>much</em> more sinister.

Then Kylo gets to tell his version of the story  Luke tried to <em>murder</em> him, and he only defended himself (a flashback of the batshit insane-looking Skywalker swinging a lightsaber at the sleeping Ben, who lashes out in return).

It's not always clear on first viewing which are which (or even sometimes that they <em>are</em> flashes, since they're not marked out by any cinematic effects or sonic cues), and many of the flashforwards lack context that only becomes apparent when the action of the film catches up to them. For instance, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">early in the film, after Sam's niece is threatened by March, there's a brief flashforward of her sitting in shock, covered in blood; it's not until nearly the end of the film that we learn whose</span>.

</li><li> The Mallorean Gospels do this for the seers of Kell. Their job is to choose which of the two prophecies will win, but they do not know which is good and which is evil. In the main plot this makes them seem almost aggressively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidNeutral">Stupid Neutral</a>, but the Gospels make their perspective a lot more reasonable and explains their behaviour, showing that they view the conflict as less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a> and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">Order Versus Chaos</a>. It also points out that since the Orb and Torak were both responsible for cracking the world, it would be impossible for someone viewing from the sidelines to tell which is truly good or evil. It's telling that the gospels don't refer to the prophecies as "Light" or "Dark", but only "First" and "Second".

At first, the poem just seems to be simple character exposition... until the penultimate chapter of the final book in the series, nine stories later, which repeats the poem after some startling new developments. Appropriately enough, the chapter is titled Once More With Feeling.

And then Death says, <span class="asscaps"> Yes, I could have done something.</span> Much later on, Susan goes back in time on Binky to the point her parents died and actually enters that same scene- Just time for the carriage to crash. Death's remark was actually directed at Susan, answering her unasked question.

Within the memories, "Snape's Worst Memory" is revisited, and we realize now the real reason it's his worst. It also causes one to reinterpret just about everything Snape said or did in the entire series, whether or not you thought Snape was a good guy or a bad guy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hx9e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0hx9e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hx9e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> sets in when you realize that the real reason Snape could never stand to look Harry in the eyes was because Harry had the same eyes as his mother, whom Snape was in love with.

</li><li> The Asimov short story <em>In a Good Cause-</em> opens and closes with a description of the biggest statue in the United Worlds plaza. The first time, it is simply a static description of the statue. The second time, the reader has knowledge that the idealistic guy whose statue it was did not truly deserve it (at least, not in his own eyes), and the person who did will never have credit.

<ul><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFortyFourHundred">The 4400</a></em> opens with Tom and Diana pointing guns at each other. Flashbacks explain how they got to this point.
</li><li> This happens occasionally on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneThousandWaysToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneThousandWaysToDie">1000 Ways to Die</a></em>. In instances where this trope is used, someone will be going through an series of activities (questionable as they might be) before suddenly dying. We then see that previous things that person did directly contribute to their death. For example, one segment sees a cemetery worker who decides to use the cemetery as a makeshift golf course suddenly get boils on his face and die. The show then reveals that he suffered from an allergic reaction to fungi, that he used a fungicide earlier, and that he had contracted the reaction by chewing on his golf tees.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanVandal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanVandal">American Vandal</a></em> is big on this near the end, as several key parts of the plot involve the documentarians going over old video footage they saw before, looking for new clues. The second season has this too, but it's toned down compared to the first.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AndThenThereWereNone2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AndThenThereWereNone2015">And Then There Were None (2015)</a></em>, there are multiple flashbacks through each episode of Vera Claythorne running along the beach screaming frantically for Cyril—a sickly boy she was governess for who drowned (and the murder U.N. Owen accuses her of). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the final iteration of the flashback, we see the full scene. Vera <em>tells him</em> that he can definitely swim to the rock and back, and then sits, drawing pictures in the sand, until enough time has passed so she can pull the desperate nanny routine. All so her boyfriend, the boy's uncle, would inherit the property and therefore feel free to propose to her. (Which he doesn't, because he is both heartbroken and savvy enough to work out that a strong, healthy adult could <em>never</em> be outstripped by a small boy with weak lungs.)</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first episode of season 4 ends with a "Six months later" scene with Oliver and Barry at a graveside mourning a friend. Nine episodes later, "Blood Debts" follows on from the mid-season cliffhanger where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Felicity gets shot</span> with a reprise of that scene (now "Four months later"). We then go back to immediately following the cliffhanger, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Felicity recovers</span>, and the end of the episode returns to the graveside where Ollie gets in a limo and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Felicity is waiting to discuss revenge on Damien Dhark for killing the person they're mourning</span>. The death occurs seven episodes after <em>that</em> in "Eleven Fifty-Nine", and the graveside scenes reappear with clarity in the following episode.
</li><li> There's an additional second level. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Felicity loses the use of her legs after being shot</span>, the scene in "Blood Debts" implies <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she still can't walk due to the way she's sitting and that she doesn't move her legs</span>. By the time the episode finally rolls around, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it turns out she'd just been sitting still; she'd regained the use of her legs a few episodes previously</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> has several examples.
<ul><li> We see Londo's vision of him and G'Kar dying with their hands around each other's throats in the very first episode, but it's not until the third season that we know what's really going on, and not until nearly the end of the fifth season that we know how they got there.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> arc also does this: in the first season's "Babylon Squared", we see a mysterious masked figure doing mysterious things; in the third season's "War Without End", we see the same events, but now we're seeing them from the point of view of the folks in masks.
</li><li> Not to mention the episode where Delenn has to take a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">drug-induced flashback</a> to when she was at Dukhat's side when he died.

A later reviewing of the flashback, combined with some research in her family records, reveals that Dukhat was also trying to tell Delenn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she was descended from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">Valen</a></span>.
</li><li> In the late fourth-season/early fifth-season episode "The Deconstruction of Falling Stars", we see some archival footage that shows Garibaldi in what seems to be a hostage situation, attempting to convince his captors not to go through with their plan. The clip <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">ends with a PPG blast</a>, implying that Garibaldi was shot. In the mid-fifth-season episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Phoenix Rising", it's revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchGunshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchGunshot">the potential shooter was the one who was shot</a>, by the leader of the group</span>.

We see that same shot in different contexts no less than three times over the course of the series, with only the last shot in the series finale being what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">really happens.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BatesMotel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BatesMotel">Bates Motel</a></em> starts with a flashback where Norman Bates discovers his father's dead body and rushes to find his mother Norma. When they get to the body Norman is crying his eyes out while Norma is suspiciously calm, and she starts to comfort him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Halfway through the season we get the full story: Norman himself killed his father in a fit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a> only to snap back to reality with no memory of the event, leaving Norma to stage the scene to look like an accident. Her "Oh Norman..." was not meant to comfort him because his dad died; she is realizing how damaged her son really is.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BroadCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BroadCity">Broad City</a></em> episode "Hurricane Wanda," Abbi can't get the toilet to flush, but Ilana promises to take care of it. Later, Marla discovers poop in her shoe, and Abbi assumes Ilana put her poop there, but Ilana denies everything. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The last scene reveals that Ilana created a makeshift container for the poop, smuggled it out of the apartment while the other characters were talking, dumped it down the trash chute at the end of the hall, and snuck back in while Bevers loudly took a dump in his sister's shoe.</span>

In the scene Angel congratulates Spike on a successful kill, and seems to be a little bored/unimpressed. It's only in the second showing that we realize how uncomfortable Angel must have been,<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> since his soul and conscience had already been restored</span>. It's more compelling than it sounds, particularly because of the bizarre surprise factor; the first scene aired during an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, the second version during the unrelated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS02E07Darla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS02E07Darla">Darla</a>", aired on the same night.

The first episode of Season 33 starts twenty minutes before that, then catches up with the finale and reveals exactly what - or rather, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">who</a></em> - Iain had been swerving to avoid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Coupling">Coupling</a></em>, being written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a>, does this a lot. Notable examples include "The Girl With Two Breasts", where Jeff's conversation with an Israeli girl takes a very different turn once we know what she's actually <em>saying</em>, and "Nine and a Half Minutes", in which Susan's reaction to her first conversation with Oliver becomes more understandable once we realise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">she thinks he's a gynocologist, not a sf bookshop owner</a>. Also the Spiderman episode where a drunken woman talks to two men <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (actually one man)</span> and tells no one in particular that she really hates the poster on the wall of Munch's "The Scream" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (she's actually looking at her own reflection in a mirror)</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "100" did this by making the audience think that a long tracking shot was in Hotch's point of view, when in fact, it's the point of view of Agent Anderson, a very occasionally recurring character.
</li><li> One Season 10 episode featured an increasingly psychotic vigilante killer. At one point, he stumbles across an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a> in a back alley, and violently assaults the man before drawing his gun. The victim begs him to kill the would-be rapist, which he swiftly does. When the police interview the woman, however, we see what actually happened: the "rapist" had been her boyfriend, they had been <em>consensually</em> kissing, and she had been begging the vigilante <em>not</em> to kill him. What we'd seen the first time was merely the man's delusion.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">CSI: NY</a></em> cold-opens with a wounded Mac Taylor suddenly facing a dual-wielding character played Edward James Olmos who has the drop on him and fires. By the time the end of the episode rolls around and we get to that scene <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it appears that he missed, and Taylor shoots him. Only for Taylor to realize that he didn't miss: he'd shot his brother, who had been about to shoot Taylor in the back</span>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenMoffat">Steven Moffat</a> really enjoyed doing this with his episodes.

The pre-title sequence to "The Big Bang", in particular, is thoroughly baffling until you see how it all pans out.
</li><li> We see disjointed snippets of a recording in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E10Blink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E10Blink">"Blink"</a> that appears to be half of a conversation.

It's not so very strange that the Doctor should realise he's been too distracted, and come back to comfort his dying friend before he has to leave. As a result, the scene stands on its own merits without seeming to stand out or demand explanation, and that makes the reveal so much more surprising when it comes. <br/>Also proving that most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">Viewers Are Geniuses</a>, since many noticed that during that scene, the Doctor was not wearing his jacket and had rolled up sleeves... something incongruous with his outfit for the rest of the episode, as well as why the Doctor was so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">out of character</a>.

The first season's finale, "Epitaph One", was mostly set about 10 years in the future but included several flashbacks to events that happened at some point before that but after season one.

She had gone to Niles's house for what turned out to be a surprise bachelorette party, at which her favorite dress was ruined by her boorish brother, Simon. Various other mishaps befall her over the next couple of days, some caused by Simon and others (inadvertently) by Frasier, Martin, and her fiance Donny, culminating in her throwing someone's laundry off the balcony and causing a traffic accident (thus the anger-management therapy). The therapist sympathizes, but says she doesn't understand one thing: why was Daphne wearing her favorite dress if the party was a surprise? We then flash back to her showing up at Niles's with the clear expectation that he was going to confess his feelings for her, and she and the therapist realize she might not want to marry Donny after all.

In "Aperitivo", after the audience has already learned that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Abigail died from her injuries</span> it's revealed that Will was actually talking to Dr. Fredric Chilton, giving the entire conversation a different tone.

<ul><li> In "The Mermaid Theory", Future!Ted literally <em>can't remember</em> how of one of the subplots he's describing went apart from a few details, and in his attempts to figure out the sequence of events he gets them wrong three times (winding up deducing that Barney managed to magically levitate a beer bottle for some reason)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1hehz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1hehz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1hehz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he forgot that it happened while Lily was pregnant, so Barney sticking a beer bottle on her pregnant belly became a beer bottle hanging in mid air in front of her</span>, and actually gives up, telling his kids "I'm sorry, just forget about that, this story makes no sense whatsoever", only for his recounting of the episode's <em>main</em> plot to suddenly remind him how the story went about five minutes later — it happened several months after he initially thought it did, which is why it made no sense in context the first times he tried to tell it.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/HowIMetYourMotherS2E04TedMosbyArchitect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/HowIMetYourMotherS2E04TedMosbyArchitect">Ted Mosby, Architect</a>", Robin and Lily track Ted around town and learn that he's cheating on Robin. They track him to his one-night stand's apartment while the girl is in the shower, enter the bedroom and find...<em>Barney</em> there, who all night has been introducing himself as "Ted Mosby, architect" because girls apparently find architects hot. We then get a montage of previous flashbacks to Ted flirting with other girls and cheating on Robin, only with Barney in his place instead.
</li><li> During his story about his 30th birthday, he keeps cutting to the goat that he's inevitably going to get into a confrontation with... only to realize at the end of the episode, Robin was living with him during the incident, so it was actually his <em>31st</em> birthday instead.
</li><li> The final season episode "How Your Mother Met Me" shows several previous episodes from the mother's perspective, and we see how those events were significant to her as well.
</li><li> In one episode, Marshall and Lily believe they are pregnant and Marshall remarks that nothing can bring him down from the high it produces. Cut to a gynecologist's office later, and they learn they aren't pregnant, and Marshall says "That did it." The story then cuts back to the middle, and we learn that Marshall and Lily are panicking at the thought of being parents and Marshall says that nothing can calm him down from his hysteria. Cut back to the gynecologist, showing that his "That did it" was actually an expression of relief, not disappointment.
</li><li> "The Burning Beekeeper" in season seven is entirely built around this trope, showing the same few minutes as they happen in different rooms, with each story interacting with the others only in small ways, so that the whole thing doesn't really make sense until the end.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowToGetAwayWithMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowToGetAwayWithMurder">How to Get Away with Murder</a></em>: The first half of every season features flash-forwards to something that happens on the mid-season finale. Often they seem to mean one thing on first showing, but are then replayed when their true meaning becomes apparent.
<ul><li> Episode 3.07 ends with a flash-forward of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wes in the police station, getting ready to sign an immunity deal, seemingly confirming he isn't the one who dies in the fire</span>. The same scene is shown again after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's shown that Wes <em>is</em> the body under the sheet.

</li></ul></li><li> The BBC drama, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle">Hustle</a></em>, does this very well. They'll go back and show how many seemingly disconnected incidents from the episode actually fit together as part of the plan. One of the best was in the Series 2 finale: The gang frequently play small tricks/cons on Eddie, the barman, cheating him out of a few quid and some drinks. So when Mickey surreptitiously rewinds Eddie's watch, tricking him into leaving the bar open longer than he intended, it is seen as an ordinary occurrence. However, Mickey would use the same technique later in order to create an alibi - photographs that seem to show they were at a social event (hosted by the police, and actually presenting an award to Mickey!) at the time that they committed the robbery. A flashback shows the original incident again, just to remind us that we could have figured it out (and give those who did figure it out a moment to feel smug).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek">Jonathan Creek</a></em> enjoys doing this as part of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSummation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSummation">The Summation</a> - indeed, as a show that was by design more of a <em>How</em>-dunnit than a <em>Who</em>-dunnit, it's an innate part of the premise that Jonathan has to figure out what actually happened. For example, in "The Coonskin Cap" we see a scene which appears to be setting up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retirony">Retirony</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFamilyPhoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFamilyPhoto">Fatal Family Photo</a> type moment by having a policeman proposing to his female colleague before she ends up being the villain's next murder victim. However at the end we see the scene again in flashback and it <em>continues</em>, showing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the engagement ring-looking box actually contained a necklace he used to plant a false clue that she was killed by the villain when he did it himself, and that their relationship was less close than it seemed in the first scene</span>.
</li><li> A few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em> shows have these sorts of flashbacks:

Then we see a scene from a mid-series episode where DJ Sagara met with the mystery woman, except this time we get the full conversation, in which Sagara says that she doesn't have full control of her new powers yet and won't be able to use them how she wants, so her attempts to change history will inevitably fail.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage">Leverage</a></em> often does the same as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle">Hustle</a></em> example above, although the significance is usually fairly obvious the first time around if you're paying any attention at all. <em>The Rashomon Job</em> plays with it by showing the same heist four times as each of the thieves remembers it, with each simultaneously explaining more of the events and exaggerating others.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> In one of the opening episodes, John Locke is shown amidst the wreckage of the plane crash. He stands up slowly and begins to walk around with absolutely none of the hysterical reaction to being in a plane crash experienced by the rest of the cast. The scene is shown again later, after it was revealed that Locke was a paraplegic before the crash, and it is clear that Locke's reaction (or lack of reaction) to the plane crash was caused by his amazement at suddenly being able to walk.
</li><li> "Expose" opens with a cryptic scene of Nikki charging out of the jungle, saying something incomprehensible and collapsing. The characters think she said "Paulo lies" and try to figure out why she and Paulo killed each other. Then we see the event from her perspective, and learn that she said "Paralyzed," as spider bites temporarily paralyzed them both...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuriedAlive">but the survivors can't figure this out in time</a>.

</li><li> Spoofed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>, in which the characters engage in duelling flashbacks, each one blurrier than the last (in parody of a similar effect in the movie they were watching). Turns out the flashbacks were blurry because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the lead character was coming in to grab his contact lenses</span>.
</li><li> At the start of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a> XI</em> episode "Give and Take", Rimmer is waiting for a lift, which is explaining that it has to go to the medbay, the sleeping quarters and the stasis booths first, and Rimmer is getting more annoyed that he doesn't take priority. Towards the end of the episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the crew travel back to the start of the episode using the stasis field, perform a kidney transplant on the two Listers, and take past!Lister back to the sleeping quarters, with future!Rimmer telling the lift to stall his past self until they've got back to their own time</span>.
</li><li> Occurs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> episode "Requiem". In the prologue, we see Magnus asphyxiate, begging Will to turn on the air vents, while Will watches mercilessly from the next room, making him appear effectively evil. By the end of the episode, we realise that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Magnus was actually the one with the evil incentive, and Will killed her to purge the parasite in her brain that was causing this before she killed them both</span>.

The meaning or importance of some of these make more sense the second time we see them, after the viewer has more information. For example, in the first episode, Camilla shuts her trunk, revealing that it has the word "dirt" written in the dust.

However, at the climax of "The Lying Detective", John watches the same video and it's revealed we didn't see the whole thing the first time: "go to hell" was actually Mary's instruction on <em>how</em> to save John, as she reasoned that the only way to save him was for him to have to save Sherlock, thus giving him renewed purpose.

Picard and three others, returning to the <em>Enterprise</em> in a runabout, find it in battle with a Romulan ship — and both frozen in time. They board the ship and see Romulans who've boarded; one has taken the helm from an Enterprise crewman, another is firing at Dr. Crusher, etc. Picard's group manage to rewind and restart the timeline, and discover that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Romulans were <em>not</em> attacking.

<ul><li> The first time Johnny Adkins tells the agents about the school bus hijack, he claims it was the work of two brothers, who we see toting sub-machine guns and taping Johnny to the chair where he was found. Towards the end, the agents learn it was actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an ex-lodger of Johnny's mother, and one of the lodger's friends</span>, and we see the same events again with the true assailants. We also see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Johnny getting bullied by the brothers he'd initially blamed - while the real culprits had merely bribed him to give false descriptions, he had fingered the brothers to try and get them in trouble</span>.
</li><li> Immediately after this, Agent Malone asks Johnny where the missing children are, and Johnny insists he doesn't know. Suspecting he's lying, Malone asks Mrs. Adkins to convince him to tell the truth. We don't hear what she says, but when she emerges, she gives Malone the location and the children are rescued. We then see the scene again, this time with sound, and learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she didn't convince Johnny at all.

The next song ("Satisfied") shows the meeting from Angelica's point of view, revealing that Alexander had met Angelica first, and that she had fallen hard, but that she had chosen her sister's happiness over her own by introducing them, despite knowing that neither she nor Alexander would ever be entirely satisfied.
</li><li> The duel between Hamilton and Burr is first seen from the latter's POV. Burr was convinced Hamilton was going to kill him so he shoots first. After that we hear Hamilton's last thoughts before he raises his gun to the sky but Burr is too late from firing the fatal shot.

That line gets a laugh. Later on in the play, when we've learned more about Bessie—that she has what today we'd call Down Syndrome, and that Gomer only kissed her because he was dared by his buddies—there is almost always a gasp from the audience when they realize what they had previously laughed at.

</li><li> For another, even bigger example, we know through Act 5 that Jack has been wreaking havoc all over the place, but because of the anarchic timeline (both in terms of us being presented with events out of order and in terms of the Medium facilitating time travel and cross-timeline confusion) it's difficult to put anything in order, and up until Cascade we still have no idea what caused Jack's bloody hand.

The Marine Park was run down, the dolphin show had one lethargic dolphin (and an implication that the second one had <em>just died</em>), Tulip couldn't see the show anyway because she was starting to need glasses, and her parents had spent the day fighting.
