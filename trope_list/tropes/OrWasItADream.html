'Snow Mountain Syndrome' ends with Haruhi convinced all the weirdness was essentially a waking dream. The possibility of this is explored (and dismissed) as a potential ending for the student movie.

He thinks it was a dream but he soon finds the badge that he received in the Pokémon world. The one problem with this idea is that the beginning of the story shows Ginji searching for his hidden birthday present, which he never found... the present may be the badge, making the adventure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> after all.

At the end, everyone is knocked out like a light and the only other one not passed out, Ryo-Ohki, even looks like she's dismissed it... until the end, where we find Kiyone, stranded on the remains of the mad scientist's base, screaming to the heavens that she's going to <em>kill</em> Mihoshi.

After fast-forwarding through (and missing) most of the important parts of his adult life, and finding his wife married to another man whom his daughter calls her 'second father', he dies of a heart attack, twenty-something years in the future. Later, he wakes up, back on the same bed in BB&amp;B and makes his way home thinking it was all a dream. When he arrives home, he finds the same remote, with a note from Mort saying everyone deserves a second chance and that Mort knows he'll do the right thing, this time. Sandler's character promptly throws it into the trash, where it finally stays.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Contact">Contact</a></em> Eleanor Arroway is led to believe that the climax of the film was all just a dream brought on an anomalous effect of the Machine, and not an actual 18-hour trip to the Vega Star system, but a fall of several seconds. However, an investigator notes that, while the electro-magnetic interference could have caused her video camera to record static during the fall, it recorded <em>18 hours of it</em>, meaning that something outside the normal laws of physics occurred when Elly dropped through the machine, it just wasn't recorded.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadEnd">Dead End</a></em>, the ending of which is peppered with a mixture of references to things encountered in the 'dream' (A sign reading 'Marcott' in the dream, a doctor of the same name in the real world), characters dying in ways relevant to a pretty bad car accident and various other things, which seem to suggest pretty clearly that the film has been entirely dreamed up by the survivor from crash to hospital... until someone cleaning up from the accident locates something her father wrote during the 'dream'.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dreamscape">Dreamscape</a></em> had a sequence like this.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> is built around this trope. Specifically, the characters go through various layers of dream-state as the film progresses, and the ending has them "waking up" from the dream state. But it's more ambiguous than that, because the main character, Dom, has a talisman that continues spinning indefinitely if he's in a dream, but eventually stops spinning if he's in real life. So, naturally, the last scene of the film shows the talisman spinning. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">And ends before we find out whether it stops</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PrinceOfDarkness">Prince of Darkness</a></em> and its mirror ending, even though it does not technically show you the other side of the mirror, nor the anti-god, still leaves the possibility of the entire movie being (or not being) a dream open for debate.
</li><li> The coda for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnToOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnToOz">Return to Oz</a></em> has the scene where Dorothy touches her new bedroom's mirror, only to have a vision of Ozma and Billina manifest itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScienceOfSleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScienceOfSleep">The Science of Sleep</a></em> doesn't use this an ending trope. Stéphane has lots of dreams and it becomes difficult to know what is and isn't real... also due to the fact he isn't sure either.

Throughout the movie, the city has been besieged, with cannon-fire falling like rain and a sense of doom in the air. Its titular Baron finishes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">ridiculous</a> yet hilarious and moving yarn by stating that though he died, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a> to him and "everyone who had a talent for it lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a>." He then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mounts his horse and rides out of the city, which <em>is as it had never been attacked</em>. The townspeople are in awe, but his most devoted listener, Sally, states in wonder that, "It wasn't just a story, was it?". The Baron waves to them as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">vanishes as if he was never there</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990">Total Recall (1990)</a></em> plays with this extensively, as the main character wants a virtual reality experience of being a spy, then is chased by spies because he accessed protected memories in his head, then is told he's really in a virtual reality experience and if he doesn't snap out he'll be lobotomized, then decides he isn't, and then at the end is told <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to kiss the woman he saw in case he really is in a dream, and the movie fades to white, leaving us to wonder if it was a dream (and he was lobotomized) or not. Another possible interpretation is that it might be both a dream and NOT lobotomized — after the last scene, he wakes up in the chair, and then is asked, "Did you like your virtual vacation? Were you the super agent you dreamed of being?". Yet another interpretation of the movie is that the dream scene at the beginning was the only real part of the movie, and the rest was just a fever dream by Quaid</span>. <br/><br/>The "dream" interpretation is made more plausible by several factors, such as the title of the virtual reality experience selected for him: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Blue Sky on Mars</span>. If you look closely at the movie sequences before the Rekall experience, you'll also notice that <strong>all</strong> the characters (except <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelIronside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelIronside">Michael Ironside</a>'s) appear before he goes to Mars. The point of divergence seems to be when he woke up screaming that the doctors blew his cover, and they apparently put him to sleep. Only after this do they claim he had a memory cap planted, maybe for his subconscious to blame the "big bad Agency". The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> appears on TV, so do things about ancient alien artifacts, a news presenter having a close resemblance to Quaid's new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, also "model 41" is a <strong>perfect</strong> resemblance to her, which is a big coincidence for just 3-4 specifications. At the beginning of the movie, Quaid seems a bit... unnerved, maybe his wife knows he already has some psychological problems which he doesn't know, and is trying to no avail to put Mars out of his head. And does the "crooked taxi drivers" line said by the main doctor ring any bells?

Characters after death can go into a state called "half-life", which is in many ways comparable to a dream state; in particular, half-life is subject to a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warping</a> possibilities that don't seem to be possible in the setting's real world.

Furthermore, Runciter eventually contacts them from the real world. So naturally, the safe assumption is that the characters were actually the ones killed and that Runciter is all right, no? Well, not so fast. The last chapter, from Runciter's perspective, have him noticing that the face on his currency has changed: the book's protagonist, Joe Chip, is now on his currency.

Gonzo, however, is satisfied with not knowing his species and they drink milkshakes. It ends with Fozzie shaking Gonzo awake, indicating it was a dream, but then Gonzo states that he is not hungry because he's just had the milkshake.

It's a bit of a tall tale involving Vulcans meeting humans well before historical First Contact; Archer likens it to hearing that Neil Armstrong wasn't really the first man on the moon. They end up suspecting T'Pol made the whole thing up, and her vague answers seem to confirm this. But then we see her in her quarters contemplating T'Mir's handbag. T'Pol also claims in the episode that her ancestor "invented" Velcro by selling a Vulcan pouch with the fastener to a businessman.

Little Joe has quite the time convincing the townfolk they have to help him. In the battle to come, Little Joe is knocked off his horse. When he comes to, he's laying in the desert with his family nearby saying they'd been looking for him for days. When Little Joe tells them what happened, his father tells him the town is a ghost town that no one has lived for years.

The next morning, they find no evidence of the experience, with the Diggers stating they didn't see any zombies. Gretchen surmises that the group imagined the whole thing due to the scary situation. However, it then pans to the cafeteria, where the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">is shown one of the zombies' glasses which had been knocked off in the ordeal</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>:

</li><li> In "Chuckie's Wonderful Life", Chuckie's guardian angel appears to show him what life would be like without him but Chuckie wakes up... only to see a similar-looking boy on a motorcycle.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>
<ul><li> In the episode "Thank God It's Doomsday", Homer wonders if visiting the afterlife was all a dream. When Homer sees that God had granted him his wish to see Moe's Tavern restored (whereas earlier in the episode it had been converted into a sushi bar), he takes what happened as fact.
</li><li> In ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E7TreehouseOfHorrorII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS3E7TreehouseOfHorrorII">Treehouse of Horror II</a>", Homer wakes up from a horrible dream where Mr Burns's head was grafted to his body only to find Mr Burns's head is still there.
</li><li> Parodied in "Tennis the Menace." Homer has a nightmare that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">Bart has murdered him and married Marge</a>. After waking up, Homer sees a picture of Bart and fearfully says, "That's the guy from my dream."
</li></ul></li><li> The season one finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity">Sheep in the Big City</a></em>, "To Sheep, Perchance to Dream", dealt with many bizarre events (such as General Specific suddenly turning into a sheep as well as Sheep and Swanky getting married) as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">actually being dreams the characters were having</a>. The narrator Ben Plotz isn't happy about this and eventually finds out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Sheep is the real villain</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">was actually able to talk</a>, and intended to use Ben in a narrator-powered ray gun. In the end, Ben wakes up and concludes that it was just a dream, but looks down to see that he really is in a narrator-powered ray gun. This twist wasn't acknowledged at all in the second season.
</li><li> Dreamy Smurf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a></em> dreams that he has been taken to the land of the Pookies, who have been waiting for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondComing">his return</a> to deliver them from the tyrannical Norf Nags.

After a series of events inspired by the movie, involving several deaths, Cartman wakes up in class again. Instead of the events being dismissed as all just a dream, his fellow students remind him that the events did happen, and that he is a murderer.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin">TaleSpin</a></em> episode "The Old Man and the Seaduck" features this ending. Baloo has returned to the old flying school that helped him recover from amnesia to get help for the instructor, one Joe McGee. When he gets back, the school is in ruins, and Joe is nowhere to be found. The doctor explains that the flying school had been closed for years since the head instructor—Joe McGee—died. Baloo then looks around the old awards, pictures, and medals...and spots a photograph, which he takes. The photo shows him and Joe standing together to pose for the camera.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTwistedTalesOfFelixTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTwistedTalesOfFelixTheCat">The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat</a></em> had an episode called "The Milky Way" where Felix encountered a dairy godmother and wished to be sent to a land where he could get all the dairy products he wants. Felix eventually gets tired of gaining weight from subsisting only on dairy products and begs the dairy godmother to send him home. She does so in a curt manner and causes Felix to plummet to his doom. Felix then wakes up only to be scared off by a milkman offering him bottles of milk, who turns out to be the dairy godmother in disguise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ZigAndSharko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ZigAndSharko">Zig &amp; Sharko</a></em>: The episode "Coral Reef Cowboys". At the end, Bernie soaks Zig with a bucket of water to snap him out. However, the latter notices Sharko, Marina and a couple of fish play blindfolds, and then takes out a starfish from the dream.
