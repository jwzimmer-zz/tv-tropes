</p><p>More often than not, a wish-granting entity (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenieInABottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenieInABottle">genie</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">vengeance demon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolodeckMalfunction">holodeck</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">leprechaun</a>, and so on) has some sort of contractual clause stating that they have to give you <em>exactly</em> what you ask for — but maybe not in the way you were thinking of when you made the wish. Ask for a ton of money, and it will appear. Right in front of you, weighing exactly one ton(and if you're lucky, it might even be in your preferred denomination). On the other hand if you ask for X-ray vision, your eyes might start shooting harmful radiation, or you may end up being able to only see in the X-ray spectrum. The entity wasn't <em>trying</em> to screw you over, it's just that your understanding of the wish's words and theirs didn't match. If you're lucky, they may give you a do-over. Otherwise, you may have to burn another wish to undo the damage.

It's almost a mystical effect, as people who have never uttered "I wish" prior otherwise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">will do so</a>. And you definitely do <em>not</em> want to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">Malaproper</a>.
</p><p>In various forms, Literal Genie wishes are very old; specific examples (e.g., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeWithoutYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeWithoutYouth">immortality without eternal youth</a>, as in the case of Eos and Tithonos) go back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/GreekMythology">Greek Mythology</a>, while the actual genie trope was known in Arabia by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">10th century</a>.
</p><p>A more modern variation is when the wisher asks for something using slang, colloquialisms, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax">Ambiguous Syntax</a>, and the Genie, having not been outside for at least a century, grants it literally because that's the only way they can understand the wish. In this regard, even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie">Benevolent Genie</a> can become a Literal one. So you can only blame yourself when the genie gives you a <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_woodpecker">Dryocopus martius<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> that's a foot tall.

</p><p>You get around this by wording your request as carefully and explicitly as possible.

<ul><li> An old animated ad for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheBurgerKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/TheBurgerKing">Burger King</a> featured a BK wizard (replete with pointy hat and magic wand) who granted the kids' requests:

</div></li><li> Variations of that joke have been done <em>a lot</em>. For example, in one Saturday morning series of animated commercials that promoted nutrition hosted by a guy named Timer, a kid asked him if he can "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlPcTGbgXUE">Make me a banana<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" and Time says, "Okay, poof, you're a banana!" (It would be funnier with pictures.)
</li><li> In a shoe commercial, a man has a lamp with a miniature genie, saying he'll grant one wish because he's still in training. His friend states that "[he] always wanted to speak Japanese." Before an official wish could be made, the genie grants this, and makes it so the first guy could <em>only</em> speak in Japanese.

Just a few minutes after the bucks magically appeared, they are going to engage in a brawl that is about as peaceful as the Running of the Bulls in a Spanish town.

Having forbidden acts of violence, he assumes himself safe until Kurama demonstrates that <em>very gently</em> lifting someone to the ceiling and then releasing them isn't really an act of violence.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CheekyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CheekyAngel">Cheeky Angel</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inverted when the lead, Megumi, gets the <em>opposite</em> of what he wished for from a spirit in a book given to him by an old man. He wished to be the most "manly man" in the world, but now <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">she</a></em> is the most "womanly woman" (the spirit claims to have misheard the wish, but more is more likely just a trickster).
</li><li> In the manga, Megumi actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was a girl all along; the genie didn't mishear the wish, but wasn't powerful enough to make her male, so changed her memories so she thought she was male instead.</span> The anime has a character suggest this without resolving it at the end.

This usually involves killing someone in a particularly gruesome manner, or in one instance <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taking someone's eye</span> — admittedly more a result of the fact that the people whose wishes are being granted are almost uniformly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionJunction">really screwed up</a>, considering that the only person to escape a confrontation with him unscathed was the one person who honestly wished to survive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a> R2</em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> Lelouch pulls one of these to his advantage in episode 8. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While discussing the terms of his exile from Japan, he gets the Britannians to agree that Zero is not a specific person, but rather anyone who accepts his ideals. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei1Gv4w3ATw">When things were set in stone, a million Japanese rebels appeared, all dressed in Zero costumes.

Part of this banked on the knowledge that Suzaku wouldn't let a massacre take place, because anyone else would have just killed them all without a thought. Even <em>Suzaku</em> was waffling on that point.</span>
</li><li> Also in season 1. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch tells princess Euphemia that if he really wanted to, he could get her to do anything he asked for, and he mentions genocide of the Japanese people as an extreme example. Unknown to him, he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">lost his ability to turn his Geass off</a>, and it conveys the order to Euphemia. Euphemia initially tries to resist the order and briefly succeeds, but is soon overtaken by its power and Lelouch is forced to shoot her.</span>
</li><li> All the times Lelouch's Geass backfires due to careless wording. His order to the policemen to shoot Mao rather than kill him leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> moment, allowing Mao to kidnap Nunnally. "Live!" comes back to bite both Lelouch and Suzaku numerous times later...
</li><li> In another Zero example, Schniezel winds up obeying Zero in the end because Lelouch geassed him to "obey Zero" rather than "obey me". This is very significant, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch's master plan culminates in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanatosGambit">his own death</a> at the hands of Suzaku, who's become the new Zero</span>.

However, it inverts this trope by following the <em>spirit</em> of the wishes, <em>not</em> the letter.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/XxxHolic">Xxx Holic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yuuko, early on, grants a woman's wish to be free of her computer (because she's become so addicted to the Internet that it's interfering with her ability to take care of her family). Yuuko grants the wish by cutting the computer in half <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>with a red baseball bat</em></span>. Yuuko even points out afterwards that she's free to buy another computer, so — as with most of Yuuko's clients — whether her wish will ultimately be granted or not is up to her.
</li><li> In one episode, there's a woman who buys a monkey's paw from Yuuko. Even when warned of its danger and reminded that the original story ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonkeysPaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonkeysPaw">The Monkey's Paw</a>") ended badly, she carries it around and uses it to her convenience. On wish number two, she wishes for an antique mirror that the owner wouldn't sell to her. It's granted by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">giving her the mirror, but without anything to cover for the fact that she effectively stole it.</span> On wish number three (of five), she wishes for help writing her thesis, and it gives her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">someone else's research, which ruins her chances of getting published once the plagiarism is discovered</span>. On wish four, she finds herself late for an important day of work and casually thinks about how her lateness would be excused if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the train system had an accident</span>. Naturally, the paw interprets it as a wish and causes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a passerby to be thrown in front of a train</span>. On wish five, shaken up from the last two, she wishes for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her ordeal to end by "erasing everything"</span>, so <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the paw kills her</span>.
</li><li> Another example was when a girl comes to the shop, terrified of her house since strange sounds are heard throughout, unattended things are moving around and sometimes she is touched by the presence of people when no one was there. Yuuko asks her if her wish was that "[her] house was not frightening", which the girl said yes. Yuuko grants her wish by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">causing the girl, who was actually a ghost, to create more disturbances around the house so the alive tenants would exorcise her.</span> Since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">now that ghost was gone</span>, the house was no longer frightening.

Gian and Suneo finds out when the robot grants Shizuka three wishes, and arranges to trick the robot into thinking them worthy. Greed then overcomes the boys and both uses their final wishes to turn each other into anthropomorphic pigs during a heated argument.
</li><li> In <em>Asuka Hybrid</em>, Asuka is a guy who got assigned to the girls dorm. While in the park depressed about this, a mage lands on him, and as an apology, she agrees to grant Asuka a wish. Asuka then says "I'm a boy, but I'm supposed to move into a girl's dorm...", so the mage fixes the problem. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">By turning him into a girl.</a>

The downside? They get turned into evil Akuma, and are forced to do the Earl's bidding, normally by stripping the skin off of their loved one who brought them back to wear, so that they blend in with humans.

Kyubey grants everyone he contracts with one wish in exchange for becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a>, and so is in a perfect position to be this.

Kyubey's granting is actually fairly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentGenie">benevolent</a> in and of itself, but the consequences of the wish are usually rather nasty, which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">conveniently serves to drive them to despair and turn them into witches, which is what Kyubey wants</span>.
<ul><li> Sayaka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wished that her crush Kyousuke would get better, but becomes extremely depressed when he starts overlooking her and Hitomi confesses to him, because what Sayaka <em>really</em> wanted was for Kyousuke to be grateful to her and fall in love with her, and to be able to think of herself as a noble, selfless person. It doesn't help that Sayaka is also beating herself up over having transformed into what is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lich">lich</a>, which she thinks makes her unworthy of Kyousuke's love. The despair brought on by these two things, and her refusal to cleanse her Soul Gem, ultimately causes her to witch out</span>.
</li><li> Kyouko <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wished that people would listen to her father's teachings and resulted in them being supernaturally driven to do so. This drives her father insane and he murders his family before killing himself. Kyouko never gives any indication that she didn't get exactly what she wished for. The problem was not with the wish itself, but with her father's perception. People were listening to him in ever increasing numbers but because it was due to his daughter's loving wish for him instead of his own rhetorical skill, which led to his breakdown. Not to mention the fact that he was a religious man and his daughter used dark magic to promote his religion</span>.
</li><li> Mami <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">made her contract to survive a car crash. She didn't know she could have saved her parents with the same wish so she didn't include them. Therefore Kyubey didn't include them either, and so they died while Mami survived.

Thus, she becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Master</a> and while she becomes powerful enough to aid Madoka, she is never able to save her from dying or witching out. After all, her wish stated "protect" Madoka, and not "save" her</span>.
</li><li> Madoka <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wished to retroactively kill every witch ever born in both the past and future. This is precisely what she does, at the cost of ceasing to exist as a person and transforming into a godlike concept destroying Witches for all eternity.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> for example, when Krillin's body gets wished back to Earth so that he wouldn't get revived in the vacuum of space <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">where Namek used to be</a>, and then revived on Earth with a second wish, Porunga takes the liberty of also repairing the damage that had been done to his corpse when the planet exploded. But sometimes this trope still comes up, simply because they're not <em>capable</em> of changing a poorly-worded wish. Every wish they grant has to be in a way that's a <em>reasonable</em> interpretation of what was actually said, even if the dragon would actually like to be more generous about it.
<ul><li> A rather famous one comes up in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> due to the line being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerise">bowdlerised</a>. To stop Emperor Pilaf from making a wish to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, Oolong rushes in and makes a wish first. In the original dub, he just wished for a pair of women's panties. In the English line he wished for "the world's most comfortable pair of underwear", which just so happened to be lady's underwear.
</li><li> On planet Namek, Gohan and Krillin have Piccolo wished back to life, and then to Namek, but they're confused when Piccolo doesn't show up. Dende (who is making the wishes for them) realizes they screwed up; while Piccolo was sent to Namek, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">they didn't specify where on Namek to send him</a>, and Piccolo ended up half a world away. It ended up working out for Piccolo, as he wouldn't have met Nail and performed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a> otherwise. And Dende suggested that they used the third wish from the Namekian dragon to send Piccolo to their exact location, but Vegeta and Frieza showing up put a stop to that, too.
</li><li> Earth's Dragon has his own moment in the same arc. When the heroes wished back everyone killed by Frieza and his men, they saved almost the entire Namekian species — except for the village Vegeta slaughtered. Since he had gone rogue from Frieza's army by that point, he wasn't one of Frieza's men, thus those deaths were outside the parameters of the wish. Vegeta finds this amusing, everyone else shoots him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a>.
</li><li> This gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforced</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> when Frieza's henchmen ask for him to be wished back to life. Since Frieza has been dead for much longer than a year, he's unable to do anything about the state of Frieza's body, and Shenron has to go out of his way to point out that he'd be returned to the cut up pieces of flesh Trunks left him in when he died. Luckily Frieza's mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">had healing tanks at the ready</a>.

She responds by having him do just that. On national TV. And it only cost 60 yen. It's clear, though, that she was just being a smartass, as she's not as literal with other requests.

The first to wish, Rikako, wishes that Yamaguchi, the boy her friend Ai likes, would like her back: it's granted, only for Ai to neglect their friendship and Yamaguchi later admit he used to like <em>Rikako</em>. When the consequences of the first wish make Rikako demand Ai uses her wish to restore the previous situation, Ai shouts she wishes Rikako and their other friend Mai, who was trying to avoid a fight, would disappear: cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>, that doesn't eat the girls only because Yamaguchi, who was passing by, gets the situation explained by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">remorseful Ai</a> and wishes the previous wish annulled. We don't know what Mai wished, but given she made it when the others were away and the scene reveals she was in love with Yamaguchi and was feeling betrayed by her friends (for whom she was willing to give up on Yamaguchi) and tells them goodbye...;
</li><li> The protagonists of the second chapter, Misa and Akio, are dead and have separately wished themselves back to life, with both wishing only themselves back alive because the shock of death made them forget the other died with them. Both have to kiss the person they love before midnight to make it stick-And while Akio loves Misa, Misa has a crush for another boy, and Akio decided to not tell Misa he too was dead. In the end Misa finds out that Akio's dead too and his condition to return to life, so she kisses him...

It occasionally even worked in his favor; once, when threatened with certain death by the Black Dragon Society, his wish that "the other Justice Society members were here to see me in this fix!" was taken quite literally by the T-Bolt — resulting in a room full of Golden Age superheroes opening up a huge can of whup-ass on the Dragons.

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> once fell victim to this trope in a big way. Wally West had never bothered with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">Secret Identity</a>, thinking it was more trouble than it was worth. But he changed his mind when his nemesis Zoom attacked his wife and killed their unborn child. In his grief, Wally summoned the all-powerful being known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a> and asked him to make the entire world forget the Flash's real identity. Spectre agreed... but since Wally said he wanted <em>everyone</em> to forget, HE FORGOT TOO. The next issue began with Wally as a down-on-his-luck nobody who had no idea he even had superpowers.
</li><li> An interesting inversion occurs in the Dutch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DouweDabbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DouweDabbert">Douwe Dabbert</a></em> comics, where the title character has a magical knapsack that always contains what he needs. Whether he knows what he needs or not. More than once, he gets the item with which he can solve his current problem in the first half of the comic, but he still needs to figure out exactly what to do with it.
</li><li> In one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainBritain">Captain Britain</a></em> comics, Captain Airstrip-One (who represents Ingsoc from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em>) is told by his supervising officer to "imagine a boot stomping on a head, forever." Captain Airstrip-One then imagines a boot stomping on a head — and doesn't stop. He <em>said</em> forever...
</li><li> Happens a <em>lot</em> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SabrinaTheTeenageWitch">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></em> comics. For one example, Sabrina is so disappointed with the tiny portion of ice cream she's ordered from a soda shop that she casts a spell to make it ten times larger. Her aunt informs her that she only made the <em>bill</em> ten times larger.
</li><li> In <em>The Wishing Wisp</em>, several characters are given visions which show the horrible consequences of their careless wishing. The wishes are often interpreted in a literal sense. In one case, for example, a man wishes some medication he just obtained will "make a new man" out of him, so in his vision he becomes a new man and is not recognized by his family or colleagues.
</li><li> In <em>Fairest</em>, a spin-off of the well-received Vertigo series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables">Fables</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead">Fiery Redhead</a> "Briar Rose" is depicted as another variation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a> character, including the part where she's showered with magical gifts and wishes by her Fairy Godmothers. To her everlasting displeasure, every wish got played straight, so only a few of her gifts are shown to be beneficial, or even remotely useful. While in the end she managed to receive supernatural beauty and allure (including a certain degree of sexual prowess by explicit wording in that sense), and the ability to excel in songwriting and playing musical instrument, having the "Wit of an Angel" means she that she lacks guile, and she's easily conned or tricked, and the wish for "the singing voice of a nightingale" actually stripped her of the ability to sing, as she can merely screech as a bird. Thus to her immense displeasure, while in the human world she was known as an accomplished songwriter and guitarist for an all-girls rock band, she never managed to took the lead, as her "blessing" was just a form of mystically induced selective mutism.

</li><li> A much more chilling example: Jesse instructs several armed men to "Fuck off," and they do, turning around and running away. One of them, as they run, looks to another with absolute terror in his eyes and asks, "<em>Forever?</em>"
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in a Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> comic that predated the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheReturnOfJafar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AladdinTheReturnOfJafar">Aladdin: The Return of Jafar</a></em> movie by several years, but had essentially the same story. In it, a little old lady gets control of Jafar's lamp and manages to get an insane amount of things from him by very carefully wording her wishes.
</li><li> In a Dutch comic based on Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em>, it is revealed that on Friday the 13th of the genie year 1313, all genies become literal genies, whether they want it or not. The Genie demonstrates this to Aladdin by asking him to wish for a pie, and promptly throws it in his face because Aladdin failed to specify how he wanted the pie delivered to him. That same day, Jafar manages to steal the lamp but quickly finds out how dangerous a literal genie can be.
</li><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Donald Duck Comic</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> has an interesting variant on this. As an April Fool joke, Huey Dewey and Louie trick Donald into believing that the rocks on an island in the Southern Sea grants wishes. Donald immediately drags them along to the island to test out the rocks — and due to a number of contrived circumstances, every wish Donald makes turns out to come true in a Literal Genie fashion, because Donald won't stop using slang when making wishes. For example, the natives of the island are worried because the ship that usually comes by to buy coconuts from them hasn't shown up, and their coconut stock is getting too big for their storage rooms. Hence, when Donald stops by, grabs a rock and loudly declares "I wish for a million coconuts!" (meaning, of course, a million <em>dollars</em>), the natives are all too happy to give him all the coconuts he wants. At the end of the story, Huey, Dewey and Louie are confused as to whether the rocks actually <em>were</em> magical or not — though all the granted wishes were easily explained away by coincidences, the fact remained that all the wishes did, after a fashion, come true.
</li><li> The horror anthology comic <em>Flinch</em> had a tale titled "Brer Hoodoo" (Done in the style of Uncle Remus/Brer Rabbit tales), where Brer Hare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">sells his soul to the Devil</a> to be able to "play [his] guitar better than any man alive". The devil makes it so, but an encounter with another, better musician leads to Hare's eventual death. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Hell, the devil explains Hare got exactly what he wished for-he was the best on <em>his</em> guitar, which didn't prevent other musicians from being better on <em>their</em> guitars.</span>

For example, Hank Chu, the hero, asks Tortoise to promise that he'll never be shot, and Tortoise fulfills the promise by ensuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletDodgesYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletDodgesYou">bullets will always dodge Hank</a> - but he's still vulnerable to everything else. That said, it doesn't stop the gods helping their hosts out in other ways.
</li><li> A <em>Minnie the Minx</em> special had Minnie find a genie in her bathroom and wish that she doesn't have to go to school. When the genie asks where she'd like to go instead, she says "Oh, any old place will do". The genie transports her to ancient Egypt, a very old place indeed.
</li><li> In "The Bizarre Batman Genie!" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Detective Comics</a></em> #322, Batman is transformed into a genie and trapped in lamp by criminals: unable to return to human until he has granted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWishes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWishes">Three Wishes</a>. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">It Makes Just As Much Sense In Context</a>.) The criminals attempt to use the Batman-Genie to commit crimes. Unfortunately for them, he is fairly literal in his understanding. Ordered to plunder the mint, Robin and Bat-Girl are able to thwart him by placing a truckload of mint plants inside the mint building. Batman 'plunders the mint' by stealing all of the mint plants.

Willow is sufficiently clever to handle the lamp and Balil, the genie within, as though she were handling a primed tactical nuke, and ends up employing a variation of the Prisoner's Dilemma to avoid any pitfalls. Her first of three wishes is for "the intelligence, knowledge, wisdom and understanding" to use her second and third wishes wisely (noting that intelligence and wisdom are not synonymous). Once she receives this wish, she and Buffy go over several drafts of her second wish, finally hitting on one that would meet their needs, as well as the needs of their friends, before presenting the draft to Balil. Willow uses the draft as her second wish, but adds as a condition that Balil may only grant the second wish if he is able to grant the third wish, which in this case is crafted to benefit Balil and his fellow genies.

Ultimately, Aladdin tricks Jafar into wishing that Genie make him into a genie himself, with all the limitations that entails — making him much less dangerous than when he was a sorcerer who could use his magic however he wanted.

It's something of a mix between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a> and Literal Genie. To make it easier to collect souls he'll take the most deadly option of your wish every time, but he does have to interpret each wish literally and can't deny a very specific wish. He can only decline if it violates a metaphysical law that existed before his kind, such as when someone asks him to "undo all evil in the world", his explanation being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">good wouldn't exist without it</a>.
<ul><li> Demonstrated hilariously in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wishmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wishmaster">first film</a>, as the Djinn tries to trick a guard into making a fatal wish. The guard simply says he wants him to go away, and the Djinn promptly turns around and starts walking away against his will, protesting that he <em>really</em> needs to get past the guard. Fortunately (for the Djinn), the guard responds to said protests by saying he'd really like to see the Djinn "go through me". The Djinn makes him part of the door.

The devil keeps finding a detail he left out, and screws him over on that point. In fact, the very first thing he wishes is to be rich and married to the love of his life — only to become a rich <em>cocaine baron</em> whose wife absolutely loathes him.
</li></ul></li><li> The family film <em>The Incredible Genie</em> does this. The protagonist kid sarcastically wishes the Genie to take "40 winks". He literally performs 40 quick winks.

The remake takes place in modern times (hence the "l33t" letters). Khottabych's liberators ask him for stacks of hundred-dollar bills. He obliges. They look exactly like hundred-dollar bills... but are printed on Egyptian papyrus. In the original novel, Khottabych has an older brother, who was also imprisoned in a vessel and has grown bitter as years went on. After he is freed, he offers his rescuer a choice of death. The quick-witted boy opts to die by old age. The genie obliges... and turns him into an old man. Naturally, since this is a children's book, the boy gets better. <br/><br/>Being Literal Genie backfired at the genie himself: he said that the boy would die at the sunset... but they were <em>ín the Arctics</em>. It could make the boy die in several months instead of hours, but the protagonist was able to convince the genie that it was him who stopped the sun on its tracks. The Soviet censorship would unlikely allow any reminiscence of Biblical prophets in a children's book (they had even avoided calling YHWH a God in a children's book of <em>Biblical legends</em>), but you surely don't gonna mess with someone who can command the sun.

<ul><li> There is a joke, wherein a guy finds a genie, and it gives him three wishes. The first two were a million dollars and a cool car, but he holds off on the third. While driving in the car, he hears the "I wish I were an Oscar Meyer wiener" commercial on the radio; it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarWorm">catchy so he sings along</a>. Poof, he's an Oscar Meyer wiener.
</li><li> Following jokes, a man meets a genie who grants him wishes but says his ex-wife gets double what he gets. He wishes for a million dollars and she gets two million. He wishes for a mansion and she gets two. For his third and final request, he wishes to be beaten half to death.
<ul><li> A smarter man in a similar variation of the joke merely asked to donate a kidney.
</li><li> Another variation replaces the wife with the man's hated boss. The final wish: "I wish my boss's wife would fuck me half to death."
</li><li> There are variations with a woman, and her divorced husband. The variants of the woman's wish include: 1) Bearing twins. 2) Big breasts 3) A lover with a ten inch penis.
</li><li> A story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSheckley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSheckley">Robert Sheckley</a>, where a man's worst enemy is the one getting double, ends with the man asking for a woman who's the limit of his desires.
</li><li> Another: the man's first two wishes are a nice mansion (with a large garden and a swimming pool etcetera), and a dozen Playboy bunnies to be around all day. Seeing that his wishes are granted correctly and his arch-enemy is granted exactly double what he got, his last wish is to have one testicle amputated.
</li><li> Another one, with a woman and her estranged husband, but the husband would get a tenfold of the first wish. She wished for a great fortune, vast beauty (which her husband got tenfold) and a slight heart attack. Subverted, or played straight, in that she didn't survive the slight heart attack, but the husband got a heart attack that was a tenfold lighter, so he got legendary hotness, almost unlimited wealth, and inherited his dead wife's wealth.
</li></ul></li><li> Though no genie is involved, an old joke that goes like this: Three men come to a cliff. A sign at the cliff reads "Jump off the cliff and name an object and you will land in a pile of it". The first man jumps and says "GOLD!", landing in a pile of gold coins. The second man jumps and says "SILVER!", landing in a pile of silver coins. The last man, about to jump, trips on a rock and falls. "CRAP!" he exclaims, falling on some manure.
<ul><li> A variant has the third go with "DIAMONDS!", which act like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfDoom">Spikes of Doom</a>, impaling and killing him.
</li><li> A variant has the men who wish for gold and silver die when they hit it, and the man who accidentally wishes for crap survives because it cushions his fall.
</li><li> Yet another version has the guy yell the F-word. Let it be known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutWithABang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutWithABang">he died a happy man</a>.
</li><li> And then there's the version that's told to kids, in which it's instead a magic slide and the third man yells "WHEEEEE!" He ends up falling in a yellow liquid, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">or maybe</a> a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">white motion-sensing Nintendo consoles...</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Another joke has an old woman get three wishes from a fairy godmother. Her first two wishes are to be rich and a young, beautiful princess, respectively. The fairy godmother grants them somewhat nicely, though she only makes the woman rich by making her rocking chair solid gold. The last wish is for the woman's dog to be turned into a handsome prince. The dog is turned into the "most handsome man anyone had ever seen", and the woman is immediately smitten with him. But then he whispers in her ear, "Bet you're sorry you had me neutered."
</li><li> There is a joke that plays out something like this: A man and an ostrich walk into a diner. The man orders a burger, fries, and a coke. The ostrich does the same. When the time comes for the man to pay for his meal, he reaches into his pocket and produces exact change. The next day, the man returns to the diner and the exact same scenario plays out. After a few more days of this, the waitress becomes curious and asks the man "Sir, how is it that you always have exact change?" and he answers "I once met a genie who granted me two wishes. For my first wish, I wished that whenever I had to pay for something, I would reach into my pocket and have the exact amount of money I need." When the waitress eventually asks him about the ostrich, he says "For my second wish, I wished for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say."
<ul><li> Another version didn't include the ostrich constantly agreeing with the guy. Instead, the guy was also accompanied by a cat who constantly refused to pay for anything; apparently, the guy had wished for a bird with long legs and a tight pussy, and to always have the exact amount money he needed.
</li><li> One variation is he rides the ostrich into a bar and orders everyone a drink. He had wished for infinite wealth, many friends, and an "exotic bird" with long legs to share it all with.
<ul><li> A saucier variation on this is him riding a giant chicken and saying that he wished for a "huge cock."
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A Czech peasant got three wishes, and wished to be of noble birth, with a beautiful wife, and world famous. He woke up in bed next to a beautiful woman who rolled over and told him: "Get up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">Franz-Ferdinand</a>, we have to be in Sarajevo in half an hour."
<ul><li> There is a variant ending with "Please come in to get your pictures taken, Citizen Romanov".
</li></ul></li><li> There is a joke about a man who wishes for a beer bottle in which the beer will never end. He's still trying to open it.
</li><li> Raunchier jokes have been done in this style, such as a man who wishes for his genitalia to reach all the way to the ground, only to lose both his legs. Another guy with the same idea wants to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackIsBiggerInBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackIsBiggerInBed">"hung like a black man"</a>, only to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlan">The Klan</a> show up at his doorstep. This would likely be an example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a> who has deliberately misinterpreted the wish, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlan">The Klan</a> would be looking to make sure the wisher would be <em>hanged</em> like a black man. It depends though, because in many languages there's no difference between "hanged" and "hung.
</li><li> There is one joke where a man encounters a "Question Genie," which will correctly answer three <em>questions</em>. The man is shocked and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">without thinking, says "So, you're a question genie, huh?"</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">"Yes."</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">"And I get ''three'' answers?"</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">"Yes."</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">"Uh oh, did those last two count?"</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">"Yes."</a></em>
</li><li> Three guys are stuck on an island in the middle of the ocean. A lamp washes on the shore. One of the men picks it up and rubs it and lo and behold, a genie comes out of it and says he can get three wishes. He laughs and berates his fellow companions, telling them how he always hated them and he's going to use the wishes for himself and not help them get off the island as well, then he makes his first wish - "I wish I was back in New York!" * snap* He's back in New York. His second wish - "I wish I owned and was in a luxury penthouse apartment, filled with money and gorgeous, bikini-clad women who all want to fulfill my every whim!" * snap* He's in the penthouse apartment, with gorgeous women fawning all over him in tiny bikinis, enough to make Hugh Hefner jealous, and enough money to make Donald Trump jealous. He laughs and leans back as one of the women gives him a massage and another kisses him, "I wish those two losers could see me now." * snap* He's back on the island.
<ul><li> A similar joke to the one above - the genie gives a wish to each man. The first two wish they were home and are sent there.

The man with an orange for a head replies: "Well, it's like this. I was walking along the beach one day when I tripped over an old lamp that was sticking out of the sand. In a flash of light, a genie appeared in front of me! The genie said to me, 'For a thousand years I have been imprisoned in that lamp. In gratitude for freeing me, I shall grant you three wishes'. So I said, 'I would like more money than I can ever spend'. There was a puff of smoke, and all over the sand there were piles of gold and jewels. 'Your second wish?' asked the genie. 'To help me enjoy all this money', I said, 'I want an intelligent, beautiful woman to spend the rest of my life with'. There was another puff of smoke, and there next to me was the loveliest woman I have ever seen. 'What is your final wish?' asked the genie. And I said, 'I'd like an orange for a head'".
</li><li> A man walks into a bar and orders a beer. While the bartender is pouring it, the man sees that a one foot tall man is playing a miniature piano beautifully. Amazed, the man says to the bartender, "Where'd you get him?" The bartender sets an oil lamp on the bar, rubs it, and a Genie pops out, offering the man a wish. He thinks for a minute and says, "I want a million bucks!" Genie snaps his fingers and disappears. A minute later, theres thunder and it starts raining ducks. They man yells at the bartender, "What the hell?! I asked for a million bucks, no a million ducks!" The bartender says, "It turns out the genie is hard-of-hearing. Why would I wish for a 12-inch pianist?"
</li><li> A man with a head the size of an apple walks into a bar and orders a drink. When he notices the bartender staring, he explains that one day while on a beach, he encountered a mermaid stuck on the shore. He carries her back into the ocean and she says she'll grant three wishes in exchange for saving her life. He does the normal wishes of money and a big house. For the third wish, he says that he'd like to have sex with her. She points out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidProblem">that their anatomies are incompatible</a>, so he shrugs and says "Ok, then how about a little head?"

The first says he's always wanted to be a bear. The second says he's always wanted to be an eagle. The third thinks and says "I've always wanted to be a stud." A week later the new rooms are ready and God walks up to St. Peter as asks where the three men are. St. Peter says "One is fishing for trout in a stream in Washington state, one is soaring through the Grand Canyon, and the third is on a snow tire in Alaska."

</li><li> An atheist was taking a walk through the woods, admiring all that evolution had created. "What majestic trees! What powerful rivers! What beautiful animals!", he said to himself. As he was walking along the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. When he turned to see what the cause was, he saw a 7-foot grizzly charging right towards him. He ran as fast as he could. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was closing, He ran even faster, crying in fear. He looked over his shoulder again, and the bear was even closer. His heart was pounding and he tried to run even faster. He tripped and fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up, but saw the bear right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw and raising his right paw to strike him. At that moment, the Atheist cried out "Oh my God!...." Time stopped. The bear froze. The forest was silent. Even the river stopped moving. As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky, "You deny my existence for all of these years; teach others I don<em></em>t exist; and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer?" The atheist looked directly into the light "It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask You to treat me as Christian now, but perhaps could you make the bear a Christian?" "Very well," said the voice. The light went out. The river ran again. And the sounds of the forest resumed. And then the bear dropped his right paw ..... brought both paws together...bowed his head and spoke: "Lord, for this food which I am about to receive, I am truly thankful."
</li><li> One joke, with which you can replace the politician/celebrity of your choice, involves them crashing on a deserted island and finding a genie in the lamp. Their first wish is to go back to their home, the second for wealth/fame/power etc. Having had enough for themselves decide to make a final selfless wish to make everyone in the world happy... at which point they find themselves again stranded on the deserted island.
</li><li> A man released a genie, but the genie told him he didn't have the time or power to grant him three specific wishes and would instead give him three "standard" wishes: a healing tonic, a really big diamond, and a date with a famous movie star. When the man went home, his bemused wife told him that he'd just received a huge shipment of chicken soup, a deed for a baseball field, and an invitation to have dinner with Lassie.
</li><li> An elderly couple in their sixties were celebrating their wedding anniversary when a genie appeared and granted them one wish each. The wife asked to be able to travel around the world, and the genie granted this wish nicely by giving her plane tickets. The husband then asked to have a wife 30 years younger than him, and the genie made him 90 years old.
</li><li> While in a changing room, a man noticed that another man had a plug stuck in his butt. When he asked the man about this, the man explained that he had rubbed a bottle he found on the beach and released a genie who told him that he could grant him one wish. Unfortunately, the man's instinctive reaction to being told this was: "No shit!"
</li><li> A Portuguese language joke: A man was telling a story of when he found three magic eggs that would grant wishes when they are broken, but while returning home he stumbled and one of the eggs fell into the ground, breaking apart. Frustrated, the man screamed "caralho!" (a curse word which literally means "dick") and them suddenly a lot of penises have grown into the grass around him, so he broke the second egg and wishes for all the dicks there to be gone. "And the third egg?", asked a friend who has listening to the story. "I had to break it to wish mine back", answered the man.
<ul><li> This works in English too if you instead have the man shouting either "nuts" or "bollocks" (depending on which side of the pond you're on) and causing a lot of testicles to bud up from the ground.
</li></ul></li><li> A poor man lived with his barren wife, his blind, dying father and his brother who had lost an arm in a war. One day he encountered a genie who offered him a wish. He was torn as whether he should help his wife, father or brother. After some thought he came up with his wish. "I want my father to live to see my wife rock her baby in the cradle that my brother has made with his own two hands."
</li><li> A male bear is chasing a bunny, but right when the bear had caught the rabbit, a genie appears. The genie said to the bear: "If you spare the bunny's life, I will grant three wishes each". The bear accepts. Then he wishes for a gigantic lair. The bunny wishes for a motorcycle, and the bear laughs at his wish. Then the bear wishes to be the only male bear in the world. The bunny wishes for a helmet, and the bear laughs at him again. Then the bear wishes for every female bear to be in love with him. The bunny jumps on his motorbike, wears the helmet and screams: "I want this fucking bear to be gay!" (Also told with "impotent" instead of "gay")
</li><li> A man gets one wish from a genie and says "Well, genie, I wish I could be you!" The genie snaps his fingers, and nothing happens. He then replies "That was a crappy wush, don't you thunk?"

For the third question, they decide to try a different approach and ask it "Just what the hell's going on? And no wriggling about trying to get out of it!" — which works far better.

The Dwarf just stands there looking awkward, because that's exactly what's happening.
</li></ul></li><li> The Auditors have similar trouble. For example when asked, "Can I offer you a drink?" they say yes, because they judge the person perfectly capable of offering them one.
</li><li> Tiffany Aching has to deal with this from two sources. The first is the Nac Mac Feegle, who just want to be helpful. While they can't actually do magic, they are determined, numerous, and immensely strong. She reflects that while never actually likely to say "I wish I could marry a handsome prince", the fact that if she did she would probably quickly find a tied up prince and clergyman at her door makes one wary of voicing ones desires out loud. There's also the Hiver, a creature which possesses people's bodies, then tries to make all their wishes come true. Even the ones they don't say, don't <em>really</em> want except for a fleeting urge, or wouldn't work towards because things like conscience or sanity hold them back.

So the cluricaune gets around it by granting a wish when someone says something that <em>sounds</em> like she's making a wish, even though she isn't. For the record, the dialogue is a woman saying she'd like to show her husband Isham a repaired table. "I show Ish that table repaired" was transposed into "I sho' wish that table repaired." The protagonist later realizes that the cluricaune was actually offering him a great gift, since even "Wishes I will actively try to make go wrong" is a truly incredible gift. It isn't the cluricaune's fault that the protagonist can't come up with good wishes.

He has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> qualities that cancel it out, though. He actually remarks, several times, on how careful the magicians have to be when giving orders to the djinn, because they try to misinterpret it to either mean nothing or cause harm to the magician. Probably the most memorable example of magicians getting around this was Nathaniel giving Bartimaeus's somewhat long orders about stealing the Amulet <em>in one breath.</em>
<div class="indent"><strong>Bartimaeus:</strong> <em>[reminiscing about one such sap]</em> ...Unfortunately for him, the precise words he used were: "Preserve me!" A cork, a great big bottle, a vat of pickling fluid, and — presto! — the job was done.

</li><li> The humor/adventure fantasy novel <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainsOutrageous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaptainsOutrageous">Captains Outrageous</a></em> uses this in the last paragraph of the book. Sorcerer Bosamp has been manipulated into trying to destroy the world by a dragon (divine beings in this setting) with the promise of a beautiful world of his own to rule. Bosamp is defeated and imprisoned, and the dragon is punished by her superiors. As the dragons' punishment begins, he superior grudgingly admires her cleverness in manipulating Bosamp, since she actually would have granted him his own beautiful world... with poisonous air and crushing gravity.
</li><li> A short story turned the Literal Genie clause back on the Devil. The Devil offers a single wish to anyone in exchange for their soul, with the limitation that if the wish is supremely selfless, the Devil has to spare the person and cease tormenting humanity forever. A man accomplishes this by wishing, <em>without any change in himself</em>, to be the most sickly, miserable, lonely, needy, cruel, corrupt, wasteful, etc., etc., person in the world. The Devil can't even twist that one by removing all the other people, à la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> genie episode: the supremely selfless nature of the wish bars him from tormenting humans any longer, and knowing he'd inadvertently caused humanity to vanish would torment the wish-maker, who can't be removed under the terms stated.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonkeysPaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonkeysPaw">The Monkey's Paw</a>": The plot of the short story is simple. A family comes across a magical preserved monkey hand with three fingers extended, representing the three wishes. Their first wish is for money, as soon as they wish it a member of their son's labor union knocks on the door to inform them that he was killed at the factory and to deliver condolence money. The mother decides to use the second wish to bring him back from the dead, which leads to a SECOND knock at the door. Before the mother can get to the door, the narrator senses that something horrible must be about to happen, and uses the third wish presumably to undo the second, though we never actually hear what the third wish was or see if it had any of its own negative side effects. In at least one version of this tale, the son died when he fell into <em>moving machinery</em>. Thus when he came back, it was as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">a horrible, mashed-up corpse.</a> The narrator unwishes the resurrection before the mother can open the door and see it.
</li><li> Magic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em> requires very careful use of language; Eragon once accidentally cursed a girl because he used the word "shield" as a noun rather than a verb, dooming her to soak up misery and pain from everyone around her.

An example would be the time that main character Matt, a transplant from our world who therefore isn't as careful about his language, yells "damn that stick!" when a big stick is in his way, and later finds out that he <em>literally damned the stick</em>. It comes back as an even bigger stick that is now pissed off because it was taken to Hell.
</li><li> In "The Knight's Tale" from Chaucer's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales">The Canterbury Tales</a></em>, two soldiers are praying the night before a tournament, where the prize is the hand in marriage of Emily. Palamon prays to Venus that he will be the one to marry Emily, while Arcite prays to Mars that he will claim victory in the tournament. Both men have their wishes granted; Arcite is able to win the battle against Palamon, but during his victory celebrations his horse becomes frightened and rears, throwing Arcite to the ground. When Arcite dies of his injuries, Theseus declares Palamon Emily's rightful husband by default.

The title character, George Fotheringay is a working-class nebbish who suddenly discovers that he can make anything happen by saying it should — but, true to this trope, the power pays no attention to metaphors. His control is improving by the end of the story, but he stumbles over the laws of physics — a preacher suggests he "stop the sun and moon" like Joshua at Jericho, and reminds him that their apparent motion comes from the earth rotating. Fotheringay orders the Earth to stop, and momentum smashes everything on the surface and/or flings it off into space. Fortunately, he wishes to survive the experience, and then <em>very</em> carefully and deliberately pushes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>.

His psychiatrist attempts, through hypnosis, to use this ability to "improve" the world. But Orr's subconscious frequently operates on the Literal Genie principle and subverts these attempts. For example, in response to the request for "peace on Earth," Orr dreams up a space war with alien invaders; when asked to end racial violence, Orr dreams up a world in which all human beings are gray.
</li><li> In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> novel of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> franchise, <em>The Stone Rose</em>, the culprit behind all unusual events was a genetically-engineered lizard/platypus hybrid with the ability to grant any wish spoken aloud starting with "I wish...". The ability of the GENIE is limited by the laws of physics. He can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">teleport</a>, and transmute matter, but it required enormous amounts of energy, which it took from any available source, including people. Transporting a person from the 24th century to Ancient Rome is easy, since the GENIE is able to use the 24th century power grid for this purpose. Going back is a different matter. <br/><br/>It should be noted that any wish that was impossible to fulfill would be interpreted in its own way by the GENIE. For example, wishing for something "never to have happened" would be impossible to fulfill, as the GENIE is unable to alter the past. Instead, he might create an illusion for the person as if the wish was actually fulfilled.

Grey and Rolf don't get anywhere with it until they start asking questions instead of giving commands.
</li><li> An example, with <strong>God</strong> as the Literal Genie, can be found in the 11th-century satirical Arabic work <em>The Epistle of Forgiveness</em>. The protagonist is in Paradise, and having just encountered a beautiful houri who asserts she has been promised to him since the time of Creation, he bows down to thank God — then finds himself thinking that while beautiful, the lass is a bit on the skinny side. As he raises his head, he finds that her buttocks have now grown a lot bigger, and needs to ask God to shorten them by a mile or two.
</li><li> Another example of God as a Literal Genie: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatDivorce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatDivorce">The Great Divorce</a></em> portrays Him as someone perfectly willing to say "<em>Thy</em> will be done" to an unbeliever, effectively condemning them to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfInflictedHell">Self-Inflicted Hell</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Elantris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Elantris">Elantris</a></em>:
<ul><li> While not a genie, Sarene promises to get the Elantrian leaders anything they ask for, then finds it a fun game twisting their requests. They ask her for 20 sheets of steel: they get 20 sheets of steel pounded so thin as to be useless. Next time they ask for steel by weight: they get boxes full of broken nails. They ask for knives, stipulating that they be sharp, and receive them sans handles. (Though they do beat her sometimes — for instance, when asking for fish, which they expect will be half-rotten, which is exactly what they wanted, since they were actually looking for fertilizer.)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeometricMagic">Geometric Magic</a> from the same series can fall under this trope, since a given Aon will do exactly what it was written to do, just like a programming language. The classic example of this is Aon Tia, which teleports you instantly from one place to another...even if this would, say, put you inside a wall. Another example shows up in the backstory: An unfortunate man brought his wife to Elantris to be treated for her disease. The healer in question misdrew the healing Aon, but instead of creating an invalid Aon (which would have just vanished and done nothing), he accidentally created a totally different but still valid Aon, which basically turned the poor woman into a zombie. This touches off the book's plot.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed and defied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em>. Two characters are having a conversation about the Nightwatcher, a powerful magical being who will grant anyone who seeks her out one wish, but also curse them at the same time. One character thinks that he could avoid being cursed if he worded his wish so that there weren't any loopholes, but the other, more knowledgeable one says that the Nightwatcher doesn't work like that — she gives you a curse she thinks is appropriate, which <em>might</em> be an ironic twist on the wish, but just as often is totally unrelated. Wording your wish really well won't get you out of it.
</li></ul></li><li> Giving this trope a hilarious twist, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> short story "The Last Wish", Geralt and his friend find a Genie who they accidentally unleash. Geralt tries to banish him by saying the words of an "exorcism", in a language he didn't understand. The Genie indeed left, only to later return, as noted by the characters, furious beyond words. Turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "exorcism" is just a prank someone played on Geralt, and roughly translates to "go and fuck yourself".

</li><li> Australian children's author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulJennings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulJennings">Paul Jennings</a> likes afflicting his characters with strange curses, sometimes as a result of this trope. The short story "Santa Claws" involves a teenage boy who wakes up one day with no memory of the last day and his mouth has shrunk to the point where he can't eat anything that won't fit through a straw. He goes to a hypnotist, who tells him to write down what happened while under hypnosis. He tells the story of he and his younger and older sisters finding a genie who grants them each two wishes. The kids are on a steep learning curve and find that whatever they wish for goes awry, whether it be due to poor phrasing, the wish being granted in an unexpected way or just a poorly thought out wish. Mayhem has ensued by the time he and his younger sister have exhausted their wishes. His older sister then wishes that they had never discovered the genie. This erases the previous events, but doesn't change the fact that she still has one wish left. The boy and girl later have a fight which culminates in her yelling "I wish you didn't have such a big mouth!"

The Traveller is a (implied) supernatural being who appears as a young man who wears a black robe and carries a staff (made of "solid light"). One of his quirks is that he is obliged to grant the first wish which someone expresses in his hearing. The speaker does not have to use any particular wording, making "if only..." just as dangerous a thing to say as "I wish..." while in the Traveller's hearing. The Traveller in Black is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a>.

</li><li> A 1980s short story serves as a distant "sequel" to the Aladdin tale. Aladdin has died of plain old age, and his son rules. Aladdin's wife misses him a <em>lot</em>. One day, a servant uncovers an old lamp. Yep, that lamp. At first, the sultana wishes for Aladdin back, buuut the genie can't do that. He can't bring his spirit back from the netherworld without something to put it in, and all that's left by now is a few bones and bits of hair. The genie could animate what's left, but he points out that the lady "wouldn't like it very much". So the sultana goes for the next best thing; she has the genie turn her favorite cat into the image of Aladdin at his prime, over his protests. Unfortunately, in this particular harem, even the male cats have to be eunuchs... which was the point of the genie's objections.

Cait Sith hates him, doesn't want to do this, and will go quickly into Jackass territory if Harry makes stupid requests.
</li><li> A variation occurs with Mab herself in that no-one asks her for a magical gift, but she is granting it because as Christmas falls in the time of Winter and giving gifts to people is the tradition, she sees it as an obligation she has to a servant. And to say no to Mab would be an injury to her pride and that is never a nice ending. So, she gives <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry Dresden's daughter Maggie</span> an ornate ring that will grant the wearer temporary magical powers over Winter matching the powers of Elsa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Frozen2013">Frozen</a></em>, and play "Let It Go".

Only after the jinn has returned to his bottle does Cimorene point out that Therandil was promised "the next dragon you fight, you will kill <em>him</em>," and that Kazul, the dragon she is working for, is female. Whether the wish would actually have failed to help Therandil against Kazul or not is never proven; Cimorene uses the logic of this trope to persuade Therandil to go fight a different (male) dragon and rescue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> princess that dragon had abducted.
</li><li> Children's novel <em>The Toothpaste Genie</em> by Sandy Frances Duncan uses this trope to amusing effect. When the protagonist, Amanda, finds a tube of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">toothpaste with a genie inside</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>. Her first wish is to be "neat," and her hair gets cemented into place. She then wishes for her nails to grow back when she bites them, but each time, her nails grow back longer and thicker until they're ridiculous. The kicker here is that the Genie can't create anything out of thin air: if she wishes for something (in this case a horse and a baby sister), it has to come from somewhere else.
</li><li> In the untranslatable German novel "<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EineWocheVollerSamstage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EineWocheVollerSamstage">Eine Woche Voller Samstage</a>", the Sams can grant a limited numbers of wishes. However, they are granted literal and any detail not specified is assigned randomly. (For example, wishing yourself into your room might end you up on the floor if you are lucky, but you also have good chances to stand on your bed or inside your locked wardrobe.) Wishing that another person does something for you leaves all unspecified detail to that persons interpretation. (If you wish that a person brings you some hamburgers, he might as well return with some inhabitants of the German town Hamburg.) In the later novel, characters learn from their mistakes and try wording their wishes as carefully as possible, but still tend to leave out some important detail that leads to everything going wrong.
</li><li> Near the end of Bruce Coville's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSkullOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSkullOfTruth">The Skull of Truth</a></em>, the embodiment of Truth offers to truthfully answer any one question for each of the main characters. One of the characters asks about his father's future and the answer Truth gives him is something along the lines of, "He will grow old. He will be happy. He will be sad. He will die." When the character complains that the answer wasn't what he wanted, Truth tells him he should have been more specific with his question.

The beer in the fridge is indeed neverending, to the point of making it explode, the vacuum he asked to "clean the entire house" follows the directions to the letter (including trying to vacuum up the curtains), and the beneficial wish of being able to speak to Wendell the dog is limited to only Tony being able to hear him, since he said "I" rather than "we".

As a reward for freeing him from the pipe organ he was imprisoned in, he gave the kids who did so a wish. They wished to become Beetleborgs, using a comic book to show Flabber who they are. Flabber, seeing rats on the cover, assumes the rats are the Beetleborgs and turns the kids into rats. After pointing out who the real Beetleborgs are, Flabber successfully turns them into Beetleborgs...without removing them from the comic book. Fortunately, Flabber is a benevolent example of this trope, as he corrects his mistakes, rather than letting the kids stick with a badly executed wish.

</li><li> Anya's co-worker, Halfrek, also falls into this.

In the second, a secondary character happens to have a book of perfectly phrased wishes to say to genies so as not to mess things up.

</li><li> A specific example: in the episode "The Man in the Bottle", an old couple uncork a genie who can grants wishes, but warns of the price to them. When the couple figures out to carefully word their wishes, the husband wishes to be a leader for life in a modern European nation, but he still messes up when the genie gleefully turns him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> at the fall of Berlin. Understandably, he quickly uses the last wish to turn himself back to normal. The episode ends on a bittersweet note, with the husband telling his wife that all things considered the lives they have now isn't <em>that</em> bad (the episode opened with them facing bankruptcy), and that as long as they have each other they can try to overcome their problems themselves without relying on magic.

</li><li> Another song of his asks him to have the lyrics in alphabetical order, and for bonus, after reaching Z, heading backwards. The lyrics ended up being "A zebra, aah!".

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a> example: Eos, the Greek goddess of the dawn, fell in love with a mortal, Tithonus, so she asked Zeus to grant him "immortality". He did. The catch was she forgot to ask for "eternal youth". Yeah. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeWithoutYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeWithoutYouth">Not a happy ending</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He keeps on aging until he shrivels up into a grasshopper. His fate after that remains uncertain.</span> Zeus <em>has</em> granted mortals eternal life before. Either these cases knew how to ask, or Zeus was just being a dick, which would not be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">out of character</a>.
<ul><li> Learning from Eos' mistake when wanting to make her own lover Endymion immortal, Selene wished for him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">remain the way he was when she got to know him</a>. This did make sure he was a handsome young man forever... but Selene is the titaness of the <em>moon</em>, as such, he was asleep when she first saw him.
</li></ul></li><li> Zeus's latest mistress Semele was tricked by Hera into asking him to grant her a wish, and got him to swear an oath on the River Styx to grant whatever she asked. For Greek gods, the oath of the Styx is unbreakable, or can be broken only with severe consequences such as the oathbreaker being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">unable to move or breathe</a> for a year, then unable to see other gods for 9 more years (a recipe for chaos and violence on Olympus if Zeus is the one missing). Then Semele wished to see him in his full glory, and was consequently burnt to ash by the sight.
</li><li> For example, there is another story about a nymph who fell in love with an extremely handsome man named Hermaphroditos (the son of Hermes and Aphrodite, hence the name), and asked Zeus to make them together forever. Zeus merged their bodies together, and thus we have the word "hermaphrodite".
</li></ul></li><li> There's a legend, later made into a Fleischer cartoon, about a miser who managed to catch a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leprechaun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leprechaun">leprechaun</a>. As per the usual terms, the leprechaun had to lead the miser to his pot of gold, which happened to be under a stump. The miser realizes he needs a shovel, puts his coat on the stump, and orders the leprechaun not to touch the coat, stump, or treasure. When he gets back, he finds the leprechaun gone, and dozens of identical stumps with identical coats on them.
</li><li> The classic three-wish fairy tale (example: <em>The Farmer and the Sausage</em>) is a folk tale staple that can be found in many cultures: invariably the third wish must be used to repair the damage caused by the first two.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBookOfMormon">The Book of Mormon</a></em>, two people at different times demanded for a sign that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> Christ existed.

</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">old</a> example: In one version of the Prague <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Golem">Golem</a> story, a 16th century Jewish tale, the Golem is asked to fill a barrel with water from the river.

Cookie wants a million cookies, but he realises he has no way to carry them, so he wishes for "a truck" and the genie gives him a tiny, almost matchbox-sized toy truck (aka a utility vehicle, with a two-person cab at the front and a load tray at the rear). Cookie realises that he needs a bigger truck so he asks for "a bigger truck" and gets another toy truck which is about one foot (30cm) long. Cookie then decides to wish for "the biggest truck of all" and finally gets a full-sized vehicle.

<ul><li> As lead-off for an article on the use of "Wish" in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em> once ran this quote:
<div class="indent"><strong>Genie:</strong> Let me get this straight. You want me to <em>raze</em> all your ability scores?
</div></li><li> An anecdote from 3.5e using the "Speak with Dead" spell, which allows you to ask three questions from a corpse:
<div class="indent">"So, I get three questions, right?" <br/><em>Yes.</em> <br/>"How many have I got now?" <br/><em>One.</em> <br/>"Are you kidding?!" <br/><em>No.</em>
</div></li><li> One notorious artifact in the game that often acts this way is <em>Kuroth's Quill</em>. It's a quill pen that can grant wishes, but the wisher must use the pen to write his request down on paper, and <em>spelling counts</em> in this case like you wouldn't believe, because the Quill does <em>exactly</em> what is written, and a spelling or grammar mistake on the wisher's part can change everything. (The source that details it instructs Game Masters to have any Player who tries to use it write what he wants down, but the Player has to find out about its condition just as he'd find out the drawbacks of any other artifact.)
</li><li> This trope <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">not</a></em> being the case is one of the usual advantages of the clerical counterpart, "Miracle" — being exactly what it says, IE. an impressive magical result provided by a being who unlike genies does <em>not</em> have any reasons to not look at intent or just say no, it is limited compared to "Wish" (since the god you're asking can decide something otherwise reasonable is not in their interest) but also less risky (since an unreasonable request is more likely to result in the god saying no and nothing happening than a literal, jackass or undesirable partial result).
</li></ul></li><li> Still with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, this can be a problem when using mind-control magic. Charms are considered less powerful because they just make the victims think the charmer is a trusted ally, and thus they won't act out of character for him — but if they end up fighting on his behalf, they will do so to the full extent of their normal abilities. Domination, on the other hand, give complete control over the victims, but the enchanter better give very precise instructions, otherwise the unwilling subject can certainly screw up things by being overly literal. For example, if you order a dominated wizard to just "Attack the enemy!", he may do so bare-handed (which is certainly useless for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>). Correct it to "Cast a <em>spell</em> on the enemy!", and the wizard will cast a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buff</a>. "No, cast an <em>offensive</em> spell on the enemy!" The wizard will cast a cantrip for pitiful damage. "Damn it, cast your <em>most damaging spell</em> on the enemy!" Cue the wizard casting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fireballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fireballs">Fireball</a> — at close range, without checking that himself and the dominator are going to get caught in the blast.
</li><li> This is one of the fundamental tenets of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em>; though Pledges are more about intent, the Contracts (spells) and the reality-warping powers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">True Fae</a> are based on extremely literal interpretations of fairly general ideas. Nonsensical catches in the contracts can allow you to call upon its power without cost- for example, smearing a mirror with a saliva-wettened tongue, being at a formal party of eight or more people, or using the contract purely to prove you can, depending on the contract.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>:
<ul><li> The basic rulebook is quite open about it, noting for instance that a summoned demon will fulfill your wish literally and that it <strong>will</strong> pervert the literal meaning if it can, or that an animated object will only follow your literal commands, and as an example states that "Drop me off here" is not a good thing to say to an animated helicopter.

<ul><li> Demon summoning in general works this way. When you manage to summon and bind a demon, you have the choice between assigning it a task with a potentially unlimited duration, or making the demon your devoted slave for one year and one day. The first option especially has endless potential for abuse, problems and loopholes. If you command a demon to "prevent anyone from entering my house when I'm not inside, forever", congratulations, you have just locked yourself (as much as anyone else) out of your own house until you (or someone else) manages to kill the demon.
</li><li> The Akuma can also be subject to this. They are demon worshippers that were "remade" by their demonic patrons in a way that both empower them and obliterate all of their personality, desires, goals and emotions, replacing them with an Urge chosen by the demon. And some demons were rather unthoughtful in this choice. For example, the akuma chief of the dreaded Lintha pirates has an urge to "serve the Sea that Marched Against the Flame" (another name of the demon prince otherwise known as Kimbery). Which means that at any time when Kimbery is not actively giving him orders, he just does nothing and waits.

His wish was "I want to become the greatest wizard known to Mankind!" and the daemon granted his wish by making him grow endlessly.

One possible backstory event had Chuubo himself wish to have an ice cream, meaning that "Chuubo has an ice cream" became a temporarily irrevocable thing - he couldn't eat it, because then he wouldn't be able to have it, and the sun began to go dark to prevent it from melting.

Most of the wishes end up getting corrupted, such as a soldier who wishes for a young body but keeps his old head, or a couple of men who wish to be able to fly and are given plane tickets — revealed after they jumped off of a roof and died, thinking they could fly.
</li><li> Usually averted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Needles Kane</a>, the driver of Sweet Tooth. He almost always gets one over on Calypso, save for his ending in the 2012 reboot: he wanted to find the one girl who survived his killing rampage to finish the job. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She commited suicide 10 years ago, so Calypso transported him inside her coffin, underground, where he suffocates to death</span>.
</li><li> Similarly, the two who wished to fly in one game had "beaten" Calypso in a previous installment through sheer virtue of being so simple-minded: they wished for new tires for their monster truck, because it wore them out very quickly. After initial surprise, a bemused Calypso grants it, no strings attached. Also worth pointing out, Calypso wasn't actively trying to screw them with the flying wish; the ending text notes that they <em>assumed</em> they could fly and jumped off the roof as a dumbfounded Calypso looks on.
</li><li> One ending in <em>Twisted Metal 2</em> shows that the winner anticipated this. In the first game, the driver of Outlaw (a police officer) confronts Calypso and gets sent into space. In the second, his sister asks to be taken to her brother, which gets <em>her</em> sent to space... at which point it's revealed her car doubles as a spacecraft, allowing her and her brother to return to Earth safely.
</li><li> He continues to invoke this in the 2012 reboot too. The first time is with Sweet Tooth, who wants to find and kill the daughter of Marcus Kane, his initial persona. But it turns out that his target, Sophie, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a>, having committed suicide because of the stress of having her own freaking father nearly killing her. So naturally, when Sweet Tooth demands he be taken to her, he does... inside a deep damn grave. Also, when Dollface gets to make her wish, she changes her mind, preferring to keep her mask if it meant wishing for instant fame without having to go through the murderous effort to get it. Although, the way she words it is ever so fertile grounds for this trope. Specifically, she wishes to walk down the biggest runway in history and to shine. And Calypso really does give her the runway. An airplane runway, that is. And the "shine" part? That happens when Dollface has an airplane light shining on her after her high heel ironically breaks.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Calypso:</strong> Why, Miss Sparks, you were right; you do shine!

<ul><li> The <em>Limited Wish</em> and <em>Wish</em> spells work like this for the most part, though it doesn't always apply it well. Wishing for a powerful magic item actually gives you a useful one for example, instead of one with an extremely powerful curse on it. Meanwhile, ask to be <em>prepared</em> against the undead and it just summons vampires to attack you, without even giving you the feeblest protection against them, making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a> (asking for <em>protection</em> will make it cast an appropriate spell on your party). How much of an ass the genie is depends on your Wisdom, which is presumably meant to mean you alter the wording based upon it, though it's not an effect you see. For example, asking for magic to no longer affect you can either stop you from casting spells, or defend you from minor spells. This is a bit unfortunate given that most mages have no use for Wisdom beyond this single spell.
</li><li> In the sequel, you encounter a beholder who was summoned and charged with guarding a chest. He's not entirely sure if that's really his job, as the summoner was stabbed to death when he issued the order, but he did scream <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OwMyBodyPart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OwMyBodyPart">"my chest!"</a> so he might have meant either. With enough wisdom, you can convince him that he's technically not under orders to guard the <em>contents</em> of the chest, only the chest itself, so he'll allow you to at least open it for a look.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with when the player can discover a story about this kind of wishmaking, though the game later implies the immortal amnesiac main character accidentally inspired the story. It goes something like this: A man finds himself sitting by a road, not sure of where or who he is. A hag comes up and, cackling, asks, "Are you ready for your third wish?" "Third wish," he asks. "What happened to my first and second?" "You've had two, but you used your second wish to undo your first. That's why you don't remember; everything is as it was before the first wish," she says. "All right," he says, "No harm. I wish to know who I am." The woman laughs and, just before vanishing, declares, "Funny, that was your first wish."
</li><li> <em>Torment</em> has another such tale: Once upon a time, a girl came to an oracle who was rumored to know many things and asked of it a boon. Her life was in need of direction, so she asked this oracle as to what would give her purpose. Now, the oracle was not evil, but it was vague and tended towards drink, which caused it to be obscure in many matters of judgment and focus. Its only answer to the girl's question was that within one story that she would hear in her lifetime was the truth that she sought. The girl went off and collected stories, which she chases to this day, not knowing which of the thousands hold the truth. For reference, that tale is told by a girl called "Yves Tales-Chaser", who you can exchange tales with (the first story is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick">Morte</a> "paying" her for another one). Now, think about it for a moment....
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>, Ganon makes a wish upon the Triforce. The exact phrasing of the wish is unknown, but it appears to have been a wish to rule the world. However, the Triforce granted it by giving Ganon total dominion over the world he was in <em>at the time</em>; the Golden Realm. On the other hand, the power he gained from that conquest would have led to him breaking into the Light world and conquering it as well, so it may have been fulfilling his wish in a sort of roundabout fashion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>, the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, the technically immortal Pig King, orders Dr. Andonuts to construct an "Absolutely Safe Capsule", which can protect him from absolutely everything in a pinch. Being one of the good guys, Dr. Andonuts chooses to take the Literal Genie approach regarding just how absolute the safety provided by the Capsule is. When the Pig King eventually faces defeat at the hands of the heroes and retreats to the Absolutely Safe Capsule, it transpires that while he is indeed impervious to any attack the heroes throw at him, <em>he</em> is also unable to attack <em>them</em>, making anyone <em>outside</em> the Capsule <em>also</em> "Absolutely Safe" as a result. The worst and most chilling part, though, is that "Absolute" safety, by definition, is impossible to compromise — once activated, the Capsule <em>cannot be opened again</em>. By entering the Capsule, the Pig King has doomed himself to spend eternity in isolation. Seemingly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>, but it's implied in the end sequence that this was actually a happy ending for him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a></em>, Sonic wishes for "A few" handkerchiefs for his cold after a brief bout of sneezing. Shahra seems too eager to serve her new master, resulting in Sonic being buried up to his head in handkerchiefs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> series, this is how Clavicus Vile, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Bargains and Wishes</a>, typically goes about granting wishes. While he always holds up his end of the bargain, he almost always does so in a way the wish maker will regret. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, he is separated from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">external conscience</a>, Barbas, and thus veers closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGenie">Jerkass Genie</a> territory. When a wizard asked Clavicus for the means to cure his daughter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">lycanthropy</a>, Vile gave the wizard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">a magic axe</a>. He was also petitioned by a group of vampires to end their suffering (i.e. they wanted to become mortal again). Cue the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> walking in and slaughtering them all. (Vile considers the wish granted in full.)
</li><li> The Wish Granter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/STALKER">STALKER</a> Shadow of Chernobyl</em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> has this in effect with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Catalyst. In the Extended Cut ending, it's revealed the Leviathans created an A.I. to find a way to stop conflict between organics and synthetics. Its solution?

</li><li> Notch, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>, pulled off the trope with riding pigs. People wanted to ride a pig and Notch made it happen, except he didn't give players any way to control the pig. It wasn't until a year later where Jeb created a new item that would let people control the pig's movements.
</li><li> The Djinn displays this <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerrordromeTheGameRiseOfTheBoogeymen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerrordromeTheGameRiseOfTheBoogeymen">Terrordrome the Game: Rise of the Boogeymen</a></em>, just like in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wishmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Wishmaster">movie series featuring him</a>. When four people (who share the identity of Ghostface) use their first wish to become the most notorious killers on Earth, he complies, giving them the strength to defeat the thirteen other fighters in the game. Come the ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where he presents them extra-terrestrial killers (as in <em>not</em> from Earth), forcing the four use their second wish to undo the first one</span>.
</li><li> The Genie NPC in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims1">The Sims</a></em>—he's not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a> so much as... erratic. The player can summon him and gets a choice between two wishes. If you guess "water", you're either gifted with a new hot tub or a flood to mop up; if you guess "money", you get either a pot of gold or a stack of bills; if you guess "fire" or "love"... the list goes on.
</li><li> A rare favorable example happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>: Supersonic Warriors 2</em>. At the end of Captain Ginyu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> storyline, he assembles the seven Dragon Balls and asks Shenron to "bring back my precious teammates", intending to resurrect the Ginyu Force. However, due to his vague wording, he also gets Frieza, Zarbon, and Dodoria in the bargain.

One incident suggested that the machine has a certain level of intelligence: when a disaster happened at the facility it is stored in, one staff member, in desperation, asked it for "a cup of relevant medical knowledge", received it, and was able to save the lives of several critically injured people.

Demona's other wishes did nothing but backfire in similarly inconvenient ways. In the end the status quo is restored, except for Demona turning into her least favorite thing during the day: a human, because she wished not to turn to stone during the day. He takes great pleasure in this, especially since Demona is very mean to him. Demona's transformation is never ended, even after the finale. An additional burn for Demona is the fact that seeing Elisa in Gargoyle form appears to be what brings Goliath (for whom Puck has already acknowledged Demona is "still holding a torch") to the conscious awareness that he is attracted to her.

After spending a few years as Xanatos' butler, Owen, he is impressed enough by his intelligence (and the fact that Xanatos is many things, but never boring) to reveal himself as Puck and offer him a choice of either one wish or a lifetime of loyal, intelligent service from Owen. Xanatos, being Xanatos, realizes that the offer was <em>itself</em> a wish, and that a trickster wish was worthless compared to a skilled, <em>strikeproof</em> employee. He chose Owen, and has never regretted it. Owen tests another Literal Genie for him, the Cauldron of Life, which legend states will make anyone who bathes in it live "as long as the mountain stones." Owen spends the rest of the series with a stone arm.

When she gave Greedy, who was sick, a bouquet of flowers, she wished she could fill his whole room with flowers; it did just that, and he got hay fever on top of it. Then it got worse. She wished he was "on his feet and fit as a fiddle", and he turned into a <em>living</em> fiddle (and to make matters worse, he was out of tune). Then she fell victim to one of Jokey's practical jokes, and she wished he'd "grow up and act serious", at which point he grew to three times his size and started talking like a Rhodes scholar.

</li><li> Another episode had one where Pumbaa saved a magical whale by throwing it back into the ocean. Telling Timon this, he gets him to go back and forth to make his three wishes, trying to be specific as possible, but all backfiring because Pumbaa didn't say it EXACTLY the way he asked it. The best example would be his final wish, when he wished for a fancy castle and just for kicks, a magical fire-breathing monster (which he expected to be a dragon and not a chicken) he can defeat. Pumbaa instead said "can't", so the episode ends with the duo hiding out from their fire-breathing fowl fiend.

When Mercurad then asks that the fortune be made more secure, Shazzan turns it into a mountain sized block of pure silver that would be too difficult to actually spend. Giving up on money, Mercurad asks for the key to ultimate knowledge. Shazzan shows him a bizarre equation that encompasses all knowledge, but without the required background to <em>understand</em> the equation it's completely useless to Mercurad. Mercurad then asks for the power of a genie. Shazzan complies, but then mentions that all genies have masters. Mercurad's master will be his own monstrous gatekeeper.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">According to Joe Murray</a>, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em>, he was asked by executives to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffirmativeActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffirmativeActionGirl">a strong female character</a> for the show, "a professional woman, someone with a good hook". Murray <a class="urllink" href="http://www.squidoo.com/rockos_modern_life#module150196406">took them at their word<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by creating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookHand">one-handed</a> Dr. Hutchinson.
</li><li> Software engineers will often play the part of a literal genie to their customers. Sometimes maliciously if they don't like them, but most of the time because no matter how stupid the requirement sounds it might just be what they really wanted after all and they <em>did</em> sign off on it. Requirements definition (a System Engineering task) is ten times worse. You <em>really</em> have to pick your words carefully, because one mistake can mean millions of dollars wasted in doing something the "wrong" way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">Remember, a computer will do exactly what you told it to do</a>. And in virtually all cases, it will be not what you wanted it to do. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGetYeFlask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGetYeFlask">You Can't Get Ye Flask</a>.
<ul><li> In one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s novels, this fact explains why the First Law is so important — not because robots are conspiring against humans, but because orders can and will be interpreted in many unpleasant ways.
</li><li> A popular rhyme is based on this: <em>I hate this damn computer. I wish that we could sell it. It won't do what I want it to. Only what I tell it.</em>
</li><li> Another line: <em>Programming is the art of describing what you want so precisely that even a computer can do it.</em>
<ul><li> A large part of good programming is to always have the program do something sensible if (or more likely, when) the computer encounters an unexpected situation, such as a missing file or missing information within a file, or information which is outside of the sensible boundaries for that type of information.
</li></ul></li><li> In the age when computers were massive mechanical machines composed of gears and pulleys, the inventor Charles Babbage was twice asked "If you input wrong figures into the machine, will it produce right answers?" He wanted to smack the stupidity out of the guys that asked the question (he didn't because both of them were members of Parliament). An understandable mistake in that age, as people weren't used to such a Literal Genie as a computer.
</li><li> Notably, this is one reason why many scientists think human-level AI and above <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">is likely to lead to bad things</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">up to and including human extinction</a>, in real life. Unless <em>extreme care</em> is taken in determining both the AI's goals and how it goes about them, it's likely to take a perfectly good goal in theory (such as promoting human happiness) and use its superhuman intelligence to promote them in ways that were wholly unintended (for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingSmiliesPaintedOnYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingSmiliesPaintedOnYourSoul">forcibly hooking people up to machines that stimulate the happiness centers in their brains 24/7</a>). Or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E2Smile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS36E2Smile">killing everyone who exhibits sadness, thinking it's dealing with a disease because it wasn't programmed for that scenario</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer">Paperclip Maximizer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a thought experiment by Nick Bostrom that shows how an artificial general intelligence, even one designed competently and without malice, could ultimately destroy humanity. Its sole directive: Maximize the amount of paperclips in its collection. It would improve its intelligence so that it can find more efficient ways to make more paperclips, and said methods will soon include "turn all matter on Earth and the cosmos into paperclips".
</li></ul></li><li> Some scams operate on this principle.
<ul><li> For example, the scammer could place an ad offering to "help cut your bills in half" for a $50 fee, and in return for the victim's money, sends him a pair of scissors.
</li><li> Another well-known example is the guy promising to reveal the secret to never lose at betting on horse races. Of course the rube receives a sheet paper with the instructions, "Don't bet, then you can't lose."
</li><li> A similar scam circulated in the United States during the boll weevil infestation of the 1920s. The scammer would advertise a sure-fire weevil killer, and a desperate cotton farmer would send in the money... to receive in the mail two heavy wooden blocks with the instructions, "place weevil between blocks and crush."
</li><li> The infamous "solar powered clothes dryer" - which upon receipt turns out to be a clothespin or clothespins and maybe the line for hanging the laundry.
</li><li> A <em>very</em> common "scam" is to sell tickets offering prizes worth an amount like $2000 and with high odds of winning. The winner recieves a coupon book, and the total savings by purchasing every single discounted product will add up to $2000.
</li><li> Another urban legend was about a $100 book that told you how to make $50,000 in no time! The only thing written inside is: "Sell 500 of these books".
</li></ul></li><li> It's a common practice in Chemistry classes to teach the class the importance of specificity in directions by having students write directions for some mundane task, and for the teacher to attempt to do it while following the directions specifically and with absolutely no additions. For example, if the task is making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, simply saying "put jelly on bread" will make the teacher place the jar of jelly on top of the bag of bread.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ha2x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ha2x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ha2x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though this doesn't even follow the letter of the instructions. The <strong>jar</strong> is on the <strong>bag.</strong> The jelly and the bread continue to have no direct interaction. It would be more accurate to just put <strong>all</strong> of the jelly onto <strong>all</strong> of the bread.</span>
<ul><li> This is also a common exercise in Computer Science 101 classes, because, as noted above, computers tend to interpret their instructions in the most literal manner possible, and new programmers have to learn to consider this.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, a grade-school level "trick" is to start listing instructions, with one of them (generally the first) being "Listen to all instructions before starting". As most students want to parse out their workload, they'll disregard this and follow the directions (write down the capital of Ohio, circle it twice, draw a doodle next to it, etc)... then hastily erase the next 10+ steps when the final one is revealed to be "Do not write down anything except the first step."
</li><li> Lawyers. They are the reason why laws are so complicated — because otherwise, the lawyers interpreting them would not hesitate to twist them however possible to suit their case. (That is their job, after all!) Averted with judges — they do generally try to determine what is reasonable and what the law-makers were intending with the law, not just what it says. If a lawyer does find a way of suiting their case that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">technically legal but clearly against the spirit of the law</a>, the judge will usually decide against them regardless.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> used this in response to the recording company that James Blunt was signed with telling him he couldn't sell his take-off "You're Pitiful", after he'd already gotten approval from Blunt and recorded it. He made it available as a free download instead.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnKricfalusi">John Kricfalusi</a>, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em>, was asked by fans to make an episode of the then-newly launched series <em>Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon</em> full of nothing but gross-out jokes. It resulted in the episode "Onwards and Upwards" — however, many viewers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">considered it to have gone way overboard.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> defines this trope as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malicious_compliance">malicious compliance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> For a possibly apocryphal and ironic example, the Aztecs believed that Quetzalcoatl, the god of life, fertility, and war, would return and transform the nation. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HernanCortez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HernanCortez">Hernán Cortés</a>, Quetzalcoatl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodGuise">God Guise</a> impostor, in a sense brought them everything the Aztecs expected, but not remotely like anything they ever imagined.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://homeonthestrange.com/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=4">The Open-Source Wish Project<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is dedicated to crafting wishes in such a precise manner that no genie can screw them up. For instance, the common wish "I want to be rich" is reworded to "I wish that I shall obtain; now and at all times hence; legally and without harm to others or myself, all such material possessions as I, being of sound mind, desire, and that receipt of same should occur within twenty-four earth hours (one day) of the desire becoming known to me. <em>Unless during that period I decide, of my own free will, that I do not wish to receive said item or items</em>."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a>,</em> Captain Kirk winds up being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Dropped a Bridge on Him</a>, but that ending was a re-shoot. Originally Kirk had a more direct fight with Soran before being killed, but this ending didn't do well with test-screenings. Supposedly a number of comments from the test screeners read "Kirk should die on the bridge." Unfortunately none of these specified "The bridge of the Enterprise."
