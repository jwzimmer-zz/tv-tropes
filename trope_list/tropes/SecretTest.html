The main difference here is that Ophanimon's test was much more irresponsible than Lord HolyAngemon's. Even though his forces were slowly losing ground to Demon, Lord HolyAngemon still had extensive reconnaissance and control over most of the continent, so he could ensure Taichi's relative safety until he and Zero had proved ready for real battles. Ophanimon had effectively lost, and though the kids could be sent back home, they had nothing but a a couple weak guides and a single Angemon to protect them if they weren't up to the task and somehow missed their train ride home.

He is told he won't be paid for his work and is required to walk over hot coals and face a gorlion (half gorilla, half lion). He faces these challenges bravely and finally meets the lama. The lama tells him that he isn't really ill: he put Dr. Droom through all that to find out if he was worthy to take the lama's place in fighting sinister occult forces.

<ul><li> <em>The Traveller</em>. While looking for a job, a man arrives at an apparently deserted castle. Its dining hall is full of sumptuous food and its luxurious rooms have everything ready for hosting guests. Since he believed that he had not yet performed any job worthy of those luxuries, he is content with eating a simple piece of bread, drinking a glass of water, and sleeping in the cellar. That night, he dreams of a white swan who speaks to him, telling him to put the castle's crown on. The next morning, he does so, and the swan appears and transforms into a beautiful princess. She tells him that, because of his temperance and humility, he has broken the castle's curse and hers; and that, if he wishes, he can become the lord of the castle with her as his wife.

A prince wants to marry a princess but can't know whether a woman who claims to be a real princess actually is. When one woman claims to be a princess, his mother decides to test her by putting a pea beneath her mattress, which has 20 more mattresses and feather beds between it and the pea. The woman says she spent a sleepless night because of something hard in her bed. The prince realizes that she must be a princess because of her highly sensitive nature, and they get married.

When he goes in to talk to a psychiatrist for a psych test, he's kept waiting and two clerks harass and insult him, but Lermer manages to keep calm. He later finds out that the clerks were psychometricians and there were a camera and microphone on him recording what happened. He was being tested to see whether he could keep his temper when provoked. <br/><br/>He does lose his cool at the very end, by angrily demanding to see what they find so funny, and then leaving in a huff when they refuse.

They're both rather surprised when it turns out he was accepted.

Several adaptations put twists on this which allow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist">Charlie</a> to have more of a hand in his triumph:

Charlie <em>is</em> strong enough to resist, partially out of regret for his misbehavior, and this proves to Mr. Wonka that he's a worthy heir</span>. Incidentally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it's possible that the fake offers to buy the Everlasting Gobstoppers has its practical side — if a child decided to sell the candy, it would go back to Mr. Wonka!

</li><li> The 2005 stage musical <em>Roald Dahl's Willy Wonka</em> uses the songs from the '71 film and rethinks this subplot. The lifetime supply of chocolate turns out to be a booby prize, and Charlie's test is a situation in which he gives in to temptation and never gets caught or called on it.

The mother is indifferent while the aunt is quietly freaking out in the background. It turns out the younger brother has been murdered and the visit was a secret test to see if the mother cared about her son BEFORE she was told that he had died. The denouement is that the remaining son then cuts off all contact with his mother as a result, meaning she loses both her sons.

The spell that keeps the toy operational is designed to wear off within a year: by that time, a non-Talented child will have outgrown their interest in it anyway, but a Talented one will unconsciously substitute their own ability for the expired spell.

When she tries to say she's paid for her mistake and deserves a second chance, he merely responds that her actions showed a lack of character. Initially she is too afraid to stand up to him, but after a talk with Worf she realizes Picard's judgment was unfair and calls him out on it.

Then he puts them through a grueling march across the desert, at the end of which is an oasis. Most of the men put their faces down to the water, but 300 men scoop up the water in their hands so that they can keep watch while they drink. Those 300 are selected as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">most spirited, most disciplined, and most well-conditioned of all his men</a>, and with them Gideon conducts the first Special Forces raid in recorded history: they infiltrate the enemy camp with trumpets and clay jars, surround their sleeping opponents, and proceed to blow their horns and smash their jars. Their opponents are understandably scared to all hell by the utterly weird nature of the attack and rout immediately, where they are slaughtered to a man by a separate blocking force of Israelites. The Bible credits Divine Inspiration for the whole thing, but whether or not you believe it, it's hard not to see the parallels between Gideon's method and modern Special Forces selection.

<ul><li> Malcolm claims he might be a worse king than Macbeth, because he is so full of lust and greed. Macduff reacts with consternation, but then Malcolm tells him it's all a lie and in fact he's the most virtuous Boy Scout in Scotland. It's not completely clear, but it is possible Malcolm is testing Macduff to make sure his first allegiance is to the benefit of Scotland.
</li><li> Malcolm suspects that Macduff may be an agent of Macbeth trying to lure him back to Scotland and into a trap. If that were the case, he would expect Macduff to respond along the lines of "It doesn't matter how bad you are; come back anyway." Instead, Macduff exclaims, "Alas, poor Scotland!" signaling to Malcolm that Macduff's goal is to save his country, not simply to bring back Malcolm.
</li><li> According to one interpretation, Macbeth himself may have been subject to such a test. The witches' prophecy told him that he would first become Thane of Cawdor, and then king hereafter. However they didn't tell him how or when he would become king. They did not convince him to plot with Lady Macbeth to murder king Duncan, they did not place daggers into his hands, and they did not force him to commit the deed and cover it up. He did all that on his own, out of his own free will. If the prophecy had been truly inevitable, Macbeth could just as easily have sat back and rested on his laurels until it happened on its own (which he actually notes at one point early in the play). Needless to say, he failed the test of character. Big time. Another interpretation is that he actually did expect to be named Prince of Cumberland (Duncan's heir): that's why he acts so shocked when Duncan actually names his son, Malcolm. (In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanistry">the throne of Scotland<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was <em>not</em> hereditary: the king was expected to pick a successor from the senior noblemen of the kingdom.

<ul><li> A job for a telegraph operator opens up. Many people come in to apply, but nobody ever calls them in for an interview, so they just sit in the waiting area listening to the tap-tap-tap of Morse code in the background. Finally, one man comes in, sits a few minutes, then gets up and goes to speak with the staff on his own. The other applicants are then told to go home, the position has been filled. The Morse code in the background? It was repeating the message "If you are able to understand this, come and speak to us, the job's yours." This story is most likely apocryphal since, naturally, even in the early age of communication, management would frown on workers trying to eavesdrop on what could be private customer communications.
</li><li> One of the most famous real-life examples is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a>'s <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/music/artists/vanhalen.asp">way of making sure the technical specifications of their performance contracts were being read and followed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: the document called for them to be provided with a bowl of M&amp;Ms with the brown ones removed, and included a clause that they could cancel the show and walk away with the money if this was not followed. This was not Van Halen being a diva; rather, it was his way of making sure the venue was actually paying attention and reading everything in full.
<ul><li> To elaborate: Van Halen's shows had flying harnesses, enough pyrotechnics for a small war, and unprecedented lighting. Their rigs were immense and <em>very</em> dangerous if they collapsed. Early in the band's career, they and their roadies suffered so many near-misses due to substandard preparation that it's a miracle no one died on tour. The potential consequence (which they never enforced) ensured that no venue would knowingly fail to comply with this directive, so if the directive was violated, it could only be by pure carelessness or oversight, which meant there were likely to be problems elsewhere. If there were brown M&amp;Ms in the bowl (or if there <em>was</em> no bowl), it indicated to the tour staff that they needed to personally check the setup for other, more serious mistakes.

Rickover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">USN</a>, "Father of the Nuclear Navy," once went out to lunch with a prospective Naval Reactors officer. When the meal arrived, the prospect started adding salt to the food, at which point Rickover told him to leave. Why? Because anyone who would put salt on his food <em>without checking that it needed salt</em> was clearly not someone with the attention to detail necessary to work with nuclear reactors—particularly not naval reactors, and most particularly not US Naval Reactors (which is so anal about procedure that it has the lowest accident rate of any nuclear operator in the world: Zero). <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lqf7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1lqf7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lqf7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The obvious flaws, of course, are that the prospect could have eaten the dish at the restaurant before, and the level of care demonstrated with one's lunch is not necessarily the same as the level of care one demonstrates on the job.</span>
</li><li> The old joke, told in the first person: "I was coming over to meet my fiancee's family for dinner, but as soon as I got in the door I ran into her gorgeous younger sister wearing a towel. She told me that she had always found me hot and wanted to make good on her last chance before I married her sister. Then she dropped the towel and left for her room, motioning for me to follow. I immediately turned to exit the front door and ran into the rest of her family on the front porch. They told me that they had to be sure I wouldn't stray. Now they could feel totally comfortable letting me marry their daughter. Moral of the story: Always keep your condoms in the glove box."
</li><li> Zhao Gao, the corrupt/evil prime minister of the Qin dynasty once brought a deer before the Emperor and began to describe it as the most wondrous stallion in all of China. Most of the officials played along, but a few continued to call the deer a deer. Zhao Gao then had everyone who told the truth executed for being too honest and not pliable enough. The story was referenced in a Chinese idiom (指鹿为马 "pointing to a deer and calling it a horse") to describe a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">ludicrously transparent and brazen lie</a>.
</li><li> There is an old joke like this. It starts off saying "a man and his talking donkey are going to X location." Then it just repeats "after 10 miles, the donkey says 'are we there yet?' and the man replies 'patience, jackass, patience.'" Obviously, if somebody asks when the joke ends, you say "patience, jackass, patience."
</li><li> Honest Tea did an experiment in major U.S. cities where they would place cases of their products out with a sign saying $1 each (a great price for it too). They set cameras on it and left it out on the honor system. At the end of the day they counted the money against the amount of product taken. Boston (93.3%) and Washington DC (93%) were the "Most Honest" while Chicago (78%) and Los Angeles (75%) were the worst.
</li><li> A small company in Washington, D.C. left bagels with cream cheese and cash boxes out in various businesses with a little sign asking people to pay one dollar per bagel. They owner made quite a profit. He kept extensive records of how different companies treated him, and they were reviewed extensively by the economist Stephen Levitt in his academic papers and his book <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Freakonomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Freakonomics">Freakonomics</a></em>. In general, the stats showed: 1) small companies were more honest than large ones, 2) certain holidays (like Christmas) drove up theft, while others (July 4th) drove it down, 3) executives stole more than lower-ranked professional employees, 4) 9-11 caused a large decrease in theft, especially among defense-related companies, and 5) overall, payment hovered near 90%. So when faced with the Secret Test, about 90% of the time, a Washington office worker is good for a buck.
</li><li> Some TV programs/groups/magazines have done an "honesty test" by leaving wallets out in the open and seeing if the person who finds it returns it or not. The magazine <em>Reader's Digest</em> did this once worldwide, and commented that people who looked like they needed the money often returned the wallet (the most notable case being a person so poor that he went through dumpsters to find bottles to sell who nonetheless returned the wallet, saying that he thought it might have belonged to a handicapped person who needed the money more than he did) whereas people who looked rich enough to not need the money often <em>didn't</em> return the wallet. One such candidate passed with flying colors by returning a wallet... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">but only after replacing the money someone else had stolen from it with his own.</a>
</li><li> In his autobiography <em>About Face</em> David Hackword mentions how he selected members of a raiding company by throwing a (dummy) grenade in among them. If they threw themselves on the grenade they lost, because they were stupid. If they didn't freeze up or do something stupid, but instead got the hell out of the tent, they passed.
</li><li> In order to become a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a> site, it's a requirement that you read all rules before submitting an application. Nestled deep within the various rules pages are passwords and instructions that you must insert those passwords in your application as well. All applications without passwords are denied.
</li><li> The Secret Test is a vital component of countless psychological tests (since it involves human subjects, it has to go through a special ethics board first, of course). For example, Asch's conformity experiment told subjects that they were part of a "perception" test and put in a group, each member of which was supposed to answer aloud which line in a row was the longest. In actuality, all but one of the "subjects" were actors. The true purpose of the test was to measure to what degree the subject would conform to the other participants' obviously incorrect but unanimous answers.
</li><li> Many upper managers will take a prospective applicant out to lunch if they've passed everything up through the interview. Based on how the applicant acts towards the wait staff, they can blow their chances. The test here being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceToTheWaiter">how they will treat those they view as beneath them.</a> If you're willing to verbally abuse the waiter, they have an idea of how you'll treat those under your supervision and on down the line.
</li><li> The story has it that when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattDamon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattDamon">Matt Damon</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck">Ben Affleck</a> were shopping around their script for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodWillHunting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoodWillHunting">Good Will Hunting</a></em>, they used a secret test to see which producers had actually read the script instead of just skimming it: on page 60 of the script, the two main characters, Will and Chuckie, have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">a completely out-of-nowhere sex scene</a>. None of the producers they spoke with mentioned the scene, until they met Harvey Weinstein, who said, "I only have one really big note on the script. About page sixty, the two leads, both straight men, have a sex scene. What the hell is that?" Needless to say, they chose Weinstein as their producer, and the rest is history.
</li><li> Former ABC News reporter Sam Donaldson recounted in his memoirs, <em>Hold On, Mr. President!</em>, how before he began his journalism career he had the opportunity to be interviewed by oilman Nelson Bunker Hunt for a job with him. It went pretty well, he asked, and at the end Hunt asked him what sort of salary he was looking at; Donaldson demurred. On the way out, Hunt's secetary asked him about how the interview went, and he told her, including the end. She told him right away he'd lost the job opportunity with that one, since Hunt believed that any man worth hiring would have no problem saying how much he thought he was worth.
</li><li> In <em>Liar's Poker</em>, Michael Lewis recounts how it was not uncommon for Wall Street firms hiring new college or business school graduates in the early 1980s to sometimes use a stress-interview technique where the interviewer would walk in a few minutes after the interviewee had arrived, then ignore him/her completely for, potentially, even longer, taking/making phone calls, doing other work. The idea was to test the interviewee's ability/willingness to take control of the situation. According to Lewis, one interviewee grew so frustrated at being treated this way that he threw a chair out the window ... of a Lower Manhattan high-rise, many storeys up.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23n1x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23n1x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23n1x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This gave rise in turn to an urban legend that the guy had <em>jumped</em> out the window ...</span>
