<ul><li> Kyoko Honda, Tohru's mother, was an amazing person who imparted her wisdom and desire to help both others and her daughter Tohru, causing her memory to live on with her. She dies in a car accident shortly before the series begins.
</li><li> Tohru's dad, Katsuya. Apparently he was such an understanding sort that he fell in love with Kyoko while she was still a delinquent, got her to see that she could be better than everyone thought, and married her despite objections from his family. In fact, a good deal of the wisdom and attitude that Tohru's mother imparted to her comes from the faith she learned from Katsuya. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Although Tohru herself suggests that she felt some resentment toward her father for her mother's suicidal behavior after he died.</span>

The movie starts with a flashback showing Haruka's mother shortly before she died, and Haruka ends up in the titular Oblivion Island partially due to a series of events related to the strained relations between her and her workaholic father. However, at the end of the movie, the mirror reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> while her mother obviously loved her, her father was more openly affectionate and spent even more time with her when she was little, implying that he works so much in order to support her, not because he's oblivious like she assumed</span>.

Naruto's parents died the day he was born, though they did love him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and even protect him from beyond the grave.</span> Still, he's an emotional basket case, though not as bad as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Pain</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Sasuke</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">Gaara (though in Gaara's case becoming an orphan was merciful, since his father kept trying to kill him).</a> It's only partially deconstructed because while many parents are abusive or negligent, some of Naruto's friends do have good parents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimbaTheWhiteLion">Kimba the White Lion</a></em>: Kimba's father was killed trying to rescue his pregnant wife from hunters, and during her time with Kimba, his mother taught him his father's ideals. When she was killed off, Kimba aimed at becoming a benevolent ruler of his father's jungle for the honor and pride of his family.

Shinji has very loving memories of his mom, Yui, and her death affects him well into his teenagers years. Gendo, the living parent, wound up abandoning Shinji after his wife died and didn't see him for years until he was needed to pilot Unit 01 (although it's often implied, if not outright stated, that getting away from Shinji was the only way Gendo could cope with Yui's death). But on the other hand... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> there are hints Yui wasn't as innocent and sweet as she seemed. She might have known beforehand about being absorbed into Unit 01, and brought her four-year-old son to watch it happen anyway. Like her husband, she seems to have a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> vibe to her, but it's unclear how heartless she really was/is.</span>

Inuyasha's dead mother did her best for her half-bred son and loved him dearly, so that Inuyasha did not hate humans entirely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SangatsuNoLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SangatsuNoLion">3-gatsu no Lion</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many of Rei's happiest memories come from his biological parents during his early childhood.

</li><li> The Kawamoto sisters speak very fondly of their mother; Akari and Hina have strong memories of how well of a caretaker she was. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Their <em>father</em>, on the other hand, is a mystery. Rei notices that they always speak of their mother and never of their father, leading Rei to theorize in his narration that something happened between the sisters and their father that doesn't exactly place him in a positive light.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>: Bruce Wayne, of course, practically worships the memory of his parents. His parents worked hard to give Bruce a strong sense of justice and knowledge of right and wrong, and the importance of helping those who need it (although they meant using the family fortune to improve the lives of Gotham's citizens, as some stories portray them as pacifists who would've disapproved of Bruce's methods). These lessons naturally fuelled his drive to become Batman after their deaths.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>'s father was a good, honest man, who pushed his son to be the best man he could be. Since the elder Murdock was a boxer, he encouraged Matt to study as hard as he could and get a good education, not being uneducated and forced to fight for a living like himself. In addition to being the superhero Daredevil, Matt became one of New York City's most respected and honest defense lawyers. And of course, his dad was killed by the mob before he got to see it happen.
<ul><li> However, this is slightly subverted. Jack Murdock loved his son, but Matt, as an adult, admits that he greatly resented his father forcing him to study instead of being allowed to play with other children. Further, when Matt got into a fight and beat up a boy who was picking on him, Jack actually slapped him, something the adult Daredevil tries to turn a blind eye to.
<ul><li> Matt Murdock's mom was also dead in the original origin, but Frank Miller later retconned it so she became a nun and Jack lied to Matt about her being dead.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a>, co-creator of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>, loved this trope, and it's especially noticeable in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>, where Peter Parker is three times an orphan, with his biological parents already dead at the beginning of <em>Amazing Fantasy</em> #15 and his surrogate father, Uncle Ben, killed in that story. It was later revealed that his parents were badass secret agents who once saved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>. Oh, and Uncle Ben apparently saw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> first-hand. Other examples from the Silver Age:
<ul><li> Sue and Johnny Storm turned from half-orphans to orphans by the death of their father, Franklin Storm, in early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a></em>. Neither Reed Richards nor Ben Grimm had living parents (that was later changed for Reed by John Byrne), Ben just mentioned his Aunt Petunia (who was also first shown by Byrne). Subsequently Ben was also given a dead brother, Jake, so he could angst over <em>his</em> violent death as well.
</li><li> Scott Summers, an orphan in the original version, as was his brother Alex, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a> later introduced Corsair as their long-lost father. Scott was originally mentored by the criminal Jack o' Diamonds.
</li><li> Professor Charles Xavier, another triple orphan, losing his father, his mother, and his stepfather in his origin stories, gaining evil stepbrother Juggernaut in the process.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">Janet Van Dyne</a> already had lost her mother, the murder of her father was what drove her to become the Wasp.
</li><li> It even extended to supporting characters, most notably in the case of Gwen Stacy, who perhaps had the coolest dad of Marvel's 1960s.
<ul><li> Certainly this trope is very pronounced in Spider-Man, where Betty Brant was an orphan to begin with and then also lost her brother Bennett in a shoot-out. Harry Osborn's mother was also dead from the beginning, in ASM #122 he also lost his father, the original Green Goblin (he got better, though). When Mary Jane finally got an origin in the mid-1980s, it was revealed that her mother also is dead. J. Jonah Jameson was introduced as a widower, which of course made his son John a half-orphan. The trope as inverted with Joe Robertson, who once mentioned he had another son, Patrick, who died.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">Bruce Banner</a> was introduced without a family. Eventually it was revealed that his mental troubles partly derive from his mother being killed by his abusive father. Bruce's longtime love-interest (and, for a time, wife) Betty Ross was introduced having lost her mother. The Hulk's occasional side-kick Rick Jones has been an orphan from the start.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em>: In the Pre-Crisis era, Superman lost both their biological and adoptive parents. Jor-El and Lara are shown to be very loving toward their only son, and of course they are killed when Krypton explodes. Jonathan and Martha Kent are loving and understanding, but both of them died from some kind of sickness before his eighteenth birthday. Later versions feature at least one surviving Kent, though.

In spite of this, she defied those orders whenever she could and did her best to nurture X-23's humanity.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ChickTracts">Jack Chick</a> tract "Happy Hour," the mother dies as an indirect result of her alcoholic husband's actions.

</li><li> Using an existing quote, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Herge">Hergé</a> quipped re. his most famous creation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Tintin">Tintin</a>: "Not everyone is so lucky as to be born an orphan."

Out of all three fathers, Raymond was largely the best and most attentive, although Roy Sr. can be forgiven because he died when Roy was three. Compared to Ollie, Raymond did his best to pay attention to Roy's needs while raising Roy to respect the traditions and legends of the Navajo community. Raymond even went as far as to get Ollie to take Roy in before Raymond died of liver cancer, knowing Ollie was Roy's hero. Unfortunately, Raymond's only shortcoming as a father was not taking to the time to learn if Ollie could be a good teacher <em>and</em> a good father to Roy.

For many fans though, it struck too much of a nerve, and they can't get past James and Sirius's bullying past. It doesn't help that we never get to see James grow as a person, and the idea that someone can <em>grow out of</em> being a bully is not widely seen in media.

As for Onni and Tuuri's parents, the fact that they let Onni bring Tuuri and the family's luggage to their house before joining the gathering during which the entire rest of the village got infected was a big factor in making Onni and Tuuri's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerendipitousSurvival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerendipitousSurvival">Serendipitous Survival</a> possible; staying in the house for a little longer than they were expected to is what ultimately kept them from being infected before someone realized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">The Plague</a> was being spread at the gathering.

Sort of - her Dad's still alive, he's just off fighting in the war, and has been gone for a couple of years when the series begins. But her main drive and source of internal conflict in the series is the death of her mom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>'s mother, Rose Quartz, is depicted as a beautiful, loving woman who was a superb leader. Though to be fair, his living father is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Good Parent</a> too (even if he is "kind of a mess" in every other facet of his life). This is gradually deconstructed as the series goes on: while Rose was a fundamentally good person, she used to be condescending towards humans (viewing them as how most people would view a cute pet) and it took her relationship with Greg for her to develop proper respect and empathy for them. Rose is also revealed to have lied to her friends about Bismuth and Pink Diamond's true fates. Additionally, Rose is also shown to have actually been naive, foolish, and childish as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Pink Diamond</span>, which she never really grew out of until her relationship with Greg. Not to mention that the Crystal Gems are shown to be greatly affected by her passing even years after the fact (not helped by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">they've been alive for millennia</a>) and Steven is saddened by the fact that he'll never know his mother the way Connie knows hers.

Additionally, Keith is implied to have been very close to his now-deceased father. However, all of the living parents on the show (except for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Haggar</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">depending on who you ask</a>) are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Good Parents</a>.

<ul><li> Jake also has fond thoughts of his late mother, Kim.

</li><li> "Rook's Story" reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Rook had a sick mother that would always support his intellect and education since young.

Specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the former queen was unable to give birth to children, and Roland wished for her to have children. Unfortunately, her body couldn't handle it, and she died. Sofia's father was a sailor who was lost at sea.
