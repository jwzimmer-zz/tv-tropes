</p><p></p><dl><dt></dt><dd> <em>When an object undergoes a proportional increase in size, its new volume is proportional to the cube of the multiplier and its new surface area is proportional to the square of the multiplier.</em>
</dd></dl><p>For example, if you double the size (measured by edge length) of a cube, its surface area is quadrupled, and its volume is increased to <em>eight times</em> its original volume.
</p><p>The point of this law is that with living beings, strength is (more or less) a function of <em>area</em> (the strength of a muscle or bone is proportional to the area of its cross-section, not to its total volume), but weight is a function of <em>volume</em>. And Newton's famous Second Law (the "force = mass × acceleration" one) means that if you double a critter's height while keeping it the same shape, you end up with <em>four</em> times the muscle power moving <em>eight</em> times the mass, so instead of having the same relative agility as the original, the double-sized creature actually has only <em>half</em>. The same goes for most machinery.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This applies to flyers as well: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">Double the size</a>, and you get four times the wingpower attempting to keep eight times the weight airborne, so the creature's ability to fly has actually been cut by half. Helicopters are hit particularly hard by this law; the largest payload of a cargo helicopter is about 20 tons, versus the world's largest airplane, with a payload of 275 tons. Sorry, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/airplane/hotelicopter.asp">Hotelicopter.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

The original <em>Graf</em> was 776 feet in length. The <em>Graf ll</em> was a mere 30 feet larger in any direction, but carried <em>double</em> the volume. Because these gains came at almost no increased structural weight, the returns went entirely into making the <em>Graf ll</em> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even more</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarshipLuxurious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarshipLuxurious">palatial flying cruise liner than her predecessor.</a>

Good news for the whales, then.
</p><p>This law is relevant when an object is shrunk down as well. Make something half its size and it will have roughly twice the proportional strength and endurance. This is why small animals, like ants, are able to carry things far heavier than themselves, part of how fleas can manage to jump so far relative to their size, and why cats can survive falls of effectively any height — get small enough and your terminal velocity will be a survivable speed. However, don't think this is all win for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncredibleShrinkingMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncredibleShrinkingMan">Incredible Shrinking Man</a>, who will likely not survive to enjoy his new found strength. Since body heat production is at least partially proportionate to volume, while heat loss is dependent on surface area exposed to the air, a shrunk human will find they are dissipating heat faster than their body produces it. It won't be long until the shrunk human freezes to death, even during a summer day. (This, incidentally, is why shrews eat their body weight in food and hummingbirds live on sugary nectar — they need such high-energy diets to avoid this.)
</p><p>A full explanation for the biological aspect is a lot more complicated due to subtler factors (muscle/bone stress, required oxygen uptake, dissipating body heat, etc.), but the gist of it is the same in every case: You can't just scale something up (or down) to a different size and expect it to still work the same way as it used to.
</p><p>Again, the law is not limited to living creatures, but applies to <em>anything</em> with mass (and, well, everything has mass): A skyscraper twice as wide and tall as another will have eight times the weight, and require a far stronger support structure — wood and brick just can't hold the weight (<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-laminated_timber#High-rise_buildings">traditional wood,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that is). This is why modern skycrapers were impossible until steel could be mass-produced to build their frames. Likewise, the humanoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> needs <em>incredibly</em> strong legs to hold its massive frame upright (probably some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Unobtainium</a>), and that's not even considering how the <em>ground</em> beneath it also needs to be able to support that same amount of weight without caving in, or the fact that it needs some <em>incredibly</em> powerful motors just to get those powerful legs and arms moving (which is why we call them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyGracefulGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyGracefulGiant">Impossibly Graceful Giants</a>).
</p><p>Knowing that audiences are becoming more savvy about this as compared to the days when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">Attack of the 50-Foot Whatever</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncredibleShrinkingMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncredibleShrinkingMan">Incredible Shrinking Man</a> were safe, standard plots, many creators who knowingly break the law will try to invent some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">Artistic License  Physics</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> how their creation can get away with breaking it — say, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> didn't just change their size, but also does something else to sustain their new size and counter the Law's negative effects upon them.

<ul><li> Lampshaded when Friend's cult tries to have a giant bipedal robot built, and the engineer they get shoots down most of their ideas as impossible. On the eve of the new millennium, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they end up using a fake robot that was just two crawler tread "legs" supporting a zeppelin with a cover and metal frame over it.</span>
</li><li> Towards the end of the series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that same engineer manages to pull it off. Though this version is at least slightly more plausible, as it's not humanoid, but rather something that looks like a cross between a frog and a chicken with the legs connected at the sides for better weight distribution. The robot is also primarily remote controlled, since, while it does have a cockpit inside, operating it manually is rendered nearly impossible due to severe motion sickness induced by its uneven gait</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> in a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpoSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpoSpeak">Expo Speak</a> concerning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">the Titans</a>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a> — they're actually much lighter than something that big has any right to be, yet still hit with the force of displacement you'd expect if their weight was proportional to their size. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">This is far from the only thing about them that makes no sense</a>, and humans know it.
<ul><li> Interestingly, the flagship Titan for the series (the Colossal Titan) follows the Law better than its smaller counterparts; since it is exceptionally massive even by other Titan's standards, its anatomy has changed in order to better support its massive frame. It has no skin and proportionally tiny arms and head to cut down on excess mass, while it's torso and legs are extremely large and well muscled in order to support its frame. It is also almost never seen doing anything other than standing in one spot and kicking something, so it doesn't normally have to worry about the bodily stresses it would undergo by ambulating.
</li><li> A later Titan would show up to be even larger than the Colossal, and was incapable of even standing upright. Its arms were underdeveloped, while its head and body were massive. The best it could do was slowly drag itself along the ground.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BlackBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BlackBullet">Black Bullet</a></em>, the monstrous Gastrea are explicitly described as inverting this principle: they are based on small animals, mostly insects, with their size drastically increased, but instead of being too weak to support their own weight, they are that many times 'stronger' proportional to their size than the original animals.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pow's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form enlarges him greatly, until he becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">kaiju</a> sized, and the first thing he does is to complain about his newfound massive weight.
</li><li> Averted by Gerard Valkyrie of the Wandenreich whose "The Miracle" ability increases his size, strength and speed accordingly so that it makes him gigantic while making him even faster.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CannonGodExaxxion">Cannon God Exaxxion</a></em>, where the titular colossus has a gravity control device powered by Antimatter. It also addresses the problem of weight distribution on the feet by replacing them with invisible forcefields that distribute the machine's (still considerable, even when mitigated by gravity control) weight over a wider area, which has the unfortunate side-effect of flattening innocent bystanders who are dozens of feet away from the mech itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> The franchise has a few characters that can grow in size, or are already gigantic compared to normal people. A Saiyan can become a massive ape monster called an Oozaru if they have their tail and see a full moon. For these characters, they already have superhuman strength, and growing larger boosts that strength somehow, Oozaru multiplies Saiyan strength 10-fold, so they can survive their size. The issue of bulky muscles becomes a plot point in the Cell saga. The Saiyans develop a Super Saiyan form that is muscular to the point they look like oversized bodybuilders (do a Google image search for Super Saiyan Third Grade and you'll get an idea from the first few pictures). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">It grants major strength, but at the cost of mobility</a>, making the form useless, not to mention that it is very inefficient at energy consumption and quickly wears out the user.
</li><li> Given that the characters by this point have enough physical strength to level mountains with a flick of the wrist, it seems odd that a slightly higher body mass would make such a huge difference. This, of course, is overcome when the Super Saiyan 2 form is reached, where strength and speed increase proportionally and with less drain on stamina.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a> originally wanted to avoid this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, with all the battles taking place in space, but eventually broke down and had the middle third of the series set on Earth. His novelizations are almost entirely set in space, though. Likewise, supplementary material notes that half the reason for Zeon's massive arms race throughout the series was in part because the Zaku was well-suited for space combat, but ended up being plodding enough that <em>infantry</em> with anti-mobile suit missiles could easily take them on in a gravity-affected environment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em> generally has issues with scaling weight up linearly from human to massive robot; with their given weight figures in that series, the average Gundam is made of material with the density of <em>styrofoam.</em>
</li><li> Later <em>Gundam</em> shows hand wave this trope. Starting in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, the mechs are built out of stronger, lighter materials. In addition, the Gundam Mk. II is built using Movable Frame technology that further lightens the weight by incorporating all the internal systems into, and all the armor<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0thva');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0thva" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0thva');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which is generally thinner than on One Year War-era suits, due to the proliferation of beam weapons that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">penetrate armor no matter how thick</a></span> directly onto, the skeletal frame of the suit, allowing for more agile and more human-like movement. That technology becomes more common and, eventually, the standard. After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Char's Counterattack</a></em>, the technology is streamlined and miniaturized, resulting in mechs that are shorter, yet far more powerful than the earlier models. This, not coincidentally, made the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">model kits</a> smaller and cheaper to produce at the same scale.
</li><li> <em>Zeta Gundam</em> also had the absolutely gigantic Psyco Gundam, which really shouldn't have been able to walk on Earth. This is lampshaded the first time it shows up, with the characters wondering how in the <em>hell</em> that thing doesn't crush itself under its own weight. The Psyco Gundam in fact needs its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Minovsky Drive</a> like the White Base to support it's own immense mass.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gyo">Gyo</a></em> obeys the law — while the walkers that carry fish up to the size of Great White Sharks can walk around on land just fine, a walker carrying a whale lumbers out of the ocean, only for its legs to immediately collapse under the weight of the whale, without any water to support it.
</li><li> Mentioned briefly by Koizumi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> when he's showing Kyon a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Celestial/Shinjin/Avatar tearing up a section of Closed Space.</span> He notes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the giant</span> should be unable to support its own weight, but also that the laws of physics in general simply don't seem to apply to them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle">Howl's Moving Castle</a></em> is explicitly only able to stand up because of magic. When the magic was taken out of the "castle," it immediately collapsed under its own weight.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kuromukuro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Kuromukuro">Kuromukuro</a></em>, we have two ways to avoid this issue in regards to giant robots — one is that the most common used robots are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> not bigger than a tank. The other is that the <em>actual</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> utilize technology that allows them to manipulate gravity, which handwaves all the problems regarding the law.
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> series that avoids this problem is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MarsDaybreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MarsDaybreak">Kenran Butousai</a></em>, which takes place on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform">terraformed</a> Mars that has been almost completely flooded. The mechs are more like giant diving suits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MazingerZ">Mazinger Z</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoNagai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GoNagai">Go Nagai</a> had this trope in mind when he created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Mazinger-Z</a>. When the anime was being made he insisted the cartoon-makers that Mazinger WAS heavy and HAD to look heavy, so they used shots low shots to make Mazinger seeming bigger and imposing, and it moved slowly and noisily. And even though Go Nagai had always intended that Mazinger-Z flew, he was afraid of making Mazinger seeming light if it flew from the start. So he held back the appearance of the Jet Scrander until that it was well established that Mazinger was heavy. Still it moves too quick to be so heavy.
</li><li> This trope is largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> and ignored by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, however there is a notable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justification</a> in the form of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the enormous Rei-Lillith hybrid that appears at the climax of <em>The End Of Evangelion</em>, which appears to be made out of some sort of weird substance that is halfway between light and matter, the experience of passing through which causes one to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">go insane</a></span>.
</li><li> Acknowledged/lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em>: Humanoid-style <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">labors</a> tend to be made with very large feet and small torsos. This trope is mentioned to a certain extent early in the TV series when Kanuka puts a labor through a bunch of stock action movie moves (jumping, flipping, etc). Noa asks Asuma why he's wincing, and he explains that while the new police labor model (the Ingram AVS-98) is technically capable of performing any motion that a human body can (with regards to degrees of freedom), it can't really take much more punishment than standard walking without requiring pretty serious maintenance, and implies that Kanuka's short perfomance will mean days of work and hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars in components to bring the labor back to 100% operating capacity.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Ant-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Superheroes like, say, Ant-Man, usually don't even bother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">giving this a wave</a>. When shrinking, Ant-Man maintains the strength of a regular human despite his size, and when growing, his size is "Proportionate" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe">as strong as the writer needs it to be</a>). Heck, <em>all</em> size-changing superheroes seem to be riddled with problems. Despite their fists often being nearly the size of a pinpoint, moving with the force of a superheroic punch, they always seem to hit like a wrecking ball instead of like a knife...
</li><li> However, there was at least one early story where Dr. Pym increased his size beyond a certain limit and collapsed, unable to move and needed The Wasp's help to shrink him back down to a reasonable size again.
</li><li> A note should be made about the new Ant-Man (Eric O'Grady): he does try to take advantage of his proportionate strength to punch out a guy (to impress a woman), but doesn't realize that his punch is more like a bullet than a hammer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> heroes use "Pym Particles" to grow and shrink, so there's an extra layer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">Phlebotinum</a> keeping it working. DC's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAtom">The Atom</a>, on the other hand, knows that shrinking is dangerous — it's even been made into a plot point and weapon, as seen in <em>Justice League: The New Frontier</em> (The Atom can alter his mass independently of his size, so it's less of an issue for him).
</li><li> In a Marvel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatIf">What If?</a></em> one-shot featuring a Soviet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, Pym (fighting for the USA) died from suffocation when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">Reed</a> forced him to grow, rendering his lungs incapable of supplying enough oxygen to sustain him. Reed did this in an attempt to incapacitate him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForScience">without considering the consequences</a>, and afterward he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIDone">horrified by what he'd done</a>.
</li><li> In Hank Pym's first appearance as Giant-Man, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> played the Law quite accurately — after he's grown a few feet, he's no longer capable of standing and needs the Wasp's help just to get at a reversal pill. He pegs his maximum effective size as twelve feet or so, and sticks to it for a while. The limitation didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">last long, though</a> — soon he was fighting giant monsters at Godzilla size!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">The Ultimates</a> version of Hank Pym can grow to <em>just</em> under sixty feet, as according to his wife, 60ft is the point at which the human skeleton can no longer support its own mass (later generic Giant-Men manage to surpass this, with no mention as to how). His ability is reverse-engineered from Jan's ability to shrink, and she mentions that she can't shrink smaller than an inch because her body automatically knows what its limits are.
</li><li> It's eventually revealed that Pym Particles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics">don't just work on size</a>, they affect strength (this trope) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDensity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDensity">density</a> as well. It turns out a few other superhumans have powers that apply Pym Particles in this manner.
</li><li> Given a nod in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>. Yellowjacket — whom we've only seen shrink up until then — grows to fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">Blockade</a>. She wins the fight, but the exertion puts enough strain on her heart that she loses consciousness.
</li><li> The movie version of Ant-Man is at least vaguely aware of this trope. Whilst our hero uses 'Pym Particles' to break this law with impunity, the villain's attempts to recreate the effect on test subjects/victims fail. Messily.
</li><li> When Ant-Man and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquirrelGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquirrelGirl">Squirrel Girl</a> team up this trope is not only discussed but utilized against the main villain (an obscure villain from Marvels past named Enigmo whose power is the ability to split himself at the cost of his mass) because, while Ant-Mans Pym Particles allow him to bypass the square cube law, Enigmo does not have any Phlebotinum to help him out in that situation so when all the little Enigmos are tricked into recombining into one giant Enigmo, the first step they take results in them breaking their leg and falling.

<ul><li> The writers occasionally lampshade this, and there has been at least one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> that Spidey is actually <em>stronger</em> than the proportionate strength of a spider — or even simply possessing a spider's strength-to-weight ratio, which is likely what the creators originally meant.

Furthermore, Hulk is generally not depicted as merely scaling up; in most depictions, the cross-sections of his arms and legs increase out of proportion, which would balance things out some.
<ul><li> It's been implied that he draws his strength from outside of his own body, and therefore muscle mass would be irrelevant.
</li><li> The size changing as he gets angrier and stronger thing is depending on the writer and the artist; some have his height stay consistent once he transforms, though this itself can be an informed ability as an artist will alter his height between panels for various reasons. Officially the Hulk's transformed height is just under eight feet tall. He'll often be shown as over ten, but that's usually stylistic or for dramatic effect.
</li><li> Where Hulk comics fail to justify or avert is in that we frequently see him standing on floors that should not be able to support what his weight must be. Hard wood would splinter under him, for example, as he probably weighs about as much as a four-door car. Floors would take an even greater beating when you realize that all that weight is being concentrated on two relatively small areas.

</li><li> Discworld's gnomes are also terrifyingly strong, despite being six inches tall, and able to knock a man out and break bones with a headbutt or otherwise — because they have the strength of a grown man, concentrated in a very small area.

</li><li> The Nac Mac Feegle seem considerably <em>stronger</em> than an average man, given that they steal cows by picking them up and carrying them off, one Feegle to a hoof. For an average-sized cow, that means they're each lifting in the vicinity of 400 pounds, and carrying it at a dead run.

The sphinx is rather small and has enormous wings. In series genius Pixel realizes the large dragon breaks the square/cube law and surmises it flies some other way. They then discover the dragon flies under the same principle as a hot air balloon. Pixel puts the flames out and the dragon crashes.

Inertia, for example, is applied realistically: to stop or turn around with a giant mecha, you need a lot of space, just like with a battleship. Sudden movements would lead to great structural damage to itself, so the controls are designed in a way to limit the maximum acceleration of actuators depending on the load the appendages have to bear.
<ul><li> And again in <em>Peace on Earth</em>, where the main character, Ijon Tichy, explores the surface of the Moon with the help of remote-controlled robots, the largest of which give him an impression of being merged in some thick liquid.
</li></ul></li><li> The short story <em>giANTS</em> actively weaponized the law to deal with mutant South American army ants (specifically, stuck in the nomadic phase and heading north). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">Genetic Engineering Is the New Nuke</a> indeed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dragon bones are specifically mentioned as a very different and much stronger material than Terran animals' bones, and larger dragons don't move much when they don't need to. Then again, they are alien enough to generate lots of concentrated phosphine without any harm.
</li><li> Likewise, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">The Dragonlover's Guide To Pern</a></em> shows that the skeletal structure of a dragon is very different from any Terran animal's.

</li><li> Of course, this trope suggests that their skeletal structure (and other anatomy) should also be very different from that of their native fire lizard cousins...
</li><li> Then to go along with the telepathy and teleportation powers of the dragons it was revealed that they have telekinesis as well, so at least part of their flight is likely a result of self-directed telekinesis to augment their wings.
<ul><li> It was implied that there were once natural dragons on Pern, and that the fire lizards are either descendants of them or have a common ancestor, so it makes sense they would keep an unnecessarily complex body structure despite their smaller size (see the human appendix and whale leg bones).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Deliberately used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> novel <em>Small Favor</em>, where Harry is fighting a twenty-foot-tall fairie hitman with a car-sized sword, battle armor, and hefty anti-magic defenses. He manages to get said hitman chasing him over a patch of waxed floor and changes direction, causing the faerie to fall over and mangle himself in the impact. He's not overwhelmingly injured (being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">faerie</a> and thus very resistant) but it <em>smarts</em> like hell.
</li><li> Addressed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> books with Rubeus Hagrid — he is a half-giant, quoted to be two times as tall as a regular man and nearly <em>five</em> times as wide, having the weight of 1,000 to 1,500 pounds. If you try to be as large as a Kodiak bear raised on the hind legs, having the body structure (and presumably the muscular strength) of a Kodiak bear helps a lot. Even better when your 7 days a week job is mostly physical labor around Hogwarts lands. In the movies, however, they aimed for a height of 8'6" (about 259 cm), of course towering over any human, but certainly not "twice as high." They do, however, give him an appropriate girth for his new scaled-down height (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobbieColtrane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobbieColtrane">Robbie Coltrane</a>'s real proportions).
</li><li> In <em>There Is No Darkness</em>, the protagonist is an enhanced human — well over two meters, 180 kilograms — and when in a fight against an enhanced bear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">that outmasses him by a ridiculous margin</a>, realizes square-cubes applies.
</li><li> In his novella <em>The Forgotten Planet</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MurrayLeinster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MurrayLeinster">Murray Leinster</a> plays this very straight in his presentation of a world in which insects have grown to enormous sizes, such as ants two feet long and spiders with yard-long legs, based on fossil records of actually giant insects, and are at the outer limit of what cube-square effects allow. But other insects, such as water striders, are no larger than normal, as gigantism would destroy them. <br/><br/>It's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">explicitly said</a> the gigantic size of the insects was due to a specific combination of factors which had to match exactly for them to evolve: atmosphere very humid and very rich in oxygen, thick clouds keeping constant warmth via greenhouse effect, huge quantities of nutrients available due to gigantic sizes attained by fungi. The key of the heroes survival is simply climbing to a plateau with temperate climate — the mere coolness of a temperate night renders the giant insects motionless and vulnerable.
</li><li> The short story <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurfaceTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SurfaceTension">Surface Tension</a></em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBlish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBlish">James Blish</a>, deals with a race of microscopic humanoids, and does a good job of showing physics on such a scale — for example, the surface of the pond they live in is an (almost) impenetrable barrier, and they can actually "sled" on the thermocline (the dividing line between warm surface water and deeper, cooler water) in some seasons.

Among other notions, Venus was once a comet ejected from Jupiter responsible for the Biblical plagues of Egypt, and Earth once orbited Saturn and the Biblical flood was caused by Saturn going nova and also ejecting Earth to its current orbit. Scientists everywhere rolled their eyes and dismissed him entirely because everything he suggested violated every understanding of planetary physics, as well as conservation of energy and angular momentum. However, he did influence a portion of the American public, some of whom latched onto the notion that the only reason dinosaurs could exist was because of lessened gravity on Earth's surface due to the presence of Saturn in the sky. One author inspired by Velikovsky correctly stated that a human of saurian dimensions would collapse under his own weight and die, then incorrectly reasoning that dinosaurs couldn't possibly have survived.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI">Cruel Zinc Melodies</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Big Creepy-Crawlies</a> that were created from normal insects keep running into problems with their magically-increased size, as when a giant beetle tries to take flight from a rooftop and winds up splattered on the pavement.

Andrew Swann's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonsAndDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonsAndDwarves">Dragons of the Cuyahoga</a></em>, there is a bubble of magic over Cleveland thanks to a semi-permanent magic portal open in the city, allowing dragons, elves, magic spells and other "fuzzy gnome" phenomena to flourish. The novel opens with one of said dragons fooled into flying out of the bubble and into our world where the square/cube law rules supreme. The results are... messy. Murder via reality.
</li><li> The book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels">Gulliver's Travels</a></em> nods to this law; the Lilliputans realise that since Gulliver is proportioned the same as they are but is 12 times the height, he is therefore 1,728 times the bulk and thus needs that much more food. However, it also ignores the fact that if the Lilliputans were really human-proportioned but 6 inches tall, they would rapidly freeze to death. The book also ignores the fact that the Brobdingnagians could not possibly exist because they should collapse under their own weight, despite the narration pointing out that they are as large compared to Gulliver as he is to the Lilliputians.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameoftheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameoftheWind">The Name of the Wind</a></em>, Kvothe and Denna discuss this as they figure out a way to stop the Draccus; Kvothe mentions that it would probably take only a fall of about ten feet to kill the thing.

Wells</a>' <em>The Food of the Gods</em> is that growth goes in fits and spurts because of certain factors in the bloodstream of growing animals, or the sap of plants, which are depleted and have to be replenished before the next spurt of growth occurs. When two protagonists synthesise a Food containing the missing factors (which are the same for all species), the result is giant animals and plants (humans given the Food grow to typically forty feet high) which however suffer no loss of agility or other consequences of their giant size.

<ul><li> It obeys the law with its roughly-12-to-14-foot giants, who have a body shape that is compared to bears; disproportionately large feet on the ends of short, thick legs, and wider hips than chests, bringing their centre of gravity right down.
</li><li> However, the series plays this trope dead straight with the dragons, which can grow to enormous sizes and are still able to fly perfectly well. However, there has been shown to be some connection between live dragons and the magical powers in the world, so it's possible the dragons get some magic-fueled exemption from this law.
</li><li> It's also played straight with The Wall, a man-made border which separates the Seven Kingdoms with the uncharted northern lands. It's <em>213 meters (700 feet)</em> high, and built entirely on ice. While making the TV show, the author recognized that such a huge ice structure would simply be impossible to maintain itself. Once again, however, it can be argued that it was built with the help of magic (keep in mind there is supposed to be a horn that, when played, will make the structure to fall out).

They get away with being arthropods that would do a kaiju movie proud via a combination of lower gravity (roughly 0.7 earth, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>), higher oxygen levels, and some sort of symbiotic relationship with a kind of spren (which are somewhere between personified forces of nature and little bits of magic) that seem to have some gravity related powers. Many of the creatures on Roshar have some sort of bond with spren, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Singers, a race of people who can bond with spren to change forms for various purposes</span> and Ryshardium, a type of horses <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who aren't actually native to Roshar, but</span> who have formed a bond with, oddly enough, Musicspren which makes them larger, stronger and massively more intelligent, to the point that several individuals believe they may be sapient.

</li><li> Invoked in the Cordwainer Smith story 'Golden the Ship Was — Oh! Oh! Oh!'.

Salli complains that such a creature shouldn't be able to move, and Ali responds that the aliens who made it, "... laugh at the Square-Cube Law!"
</li><li> Applied in Jarosław Grzędowicz's <em>Pan Lodowego Ogrodu</em> (Lord of the Ice Garden): the protagonist stumbles upon artificially created dragons that, due to the square/cube law being in effect, cannot move effectively and starve to death; then he finds an entire <em>boneyard</em> of dragon bones.

When she and her companions need to travel a long distance quickly, Sam proposes that she tweak the spell a little to become a really big owl, and carry everyone else in her claws. Whether this counts as a violation of the square-cube law is debatable; in theory a bird that big shouldn't be able to fly, but there is magic involved.

So, a dung beetle the size of a human could lift many metric tons, while an elephant the size of a human could barely lift a fourth of it's now much smaller weight.

Most of the crew are shrunk and one complains that it shouldn't be possible. Another tells her that it's better to think of a solution than to complain that what just happened isn't possible.

<ul><li> The law is followed with the giants. They are twice the height of a regular humans, and to compensate for the increase in weight, their legs are disproportionately long and thick, and they appear to move slowly. This effect was realized by a combination of tall actors outfitted with prosthetics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overcrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Overcrank">overcranking</a>.
</li><li> This trope is the reason for why all of the actors who've played Gregor Clegane (an 8-foot tall behemoth known as the "Mountain That Rides") have been no taller than seven feet (the shortest being 6'9"). While there certainly <em>are</em> 8-foot tall men in the world, a man of that height with Gregor's proportions is literally impossible. The loyal Stark servant Hodor is supposed to be almost a foot shorter at just over seven feet (the actor being 6'10"); luckily they two never interact so it isn't quite so obvious.
<ul><li> Not entirely impossible: there have been non-pathological (ie, those without gigantism) giants of Gregor's size throughout history, though certainly not common.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Played for laughs (naturally) in comedy series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodies">The Goodies</a></em>, episode "Kitten Kong", in which (as the title implies) the three ply a kitten with a miracle growth-promoting food. In the end they manage to get it back to normal size<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, but then discover that they have a problem with mice — giant ones...</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MythBusters">MythBusters</a></em>:
<ul><li> Once on the show, Adam was attempting to use a toy as a scale model human to test parachutes. He calculated its weight as a proportion of height and got an unreasonably large number. He later realized his mistake and calculated as a ratio of volume. The irony is that this approach <em>still</em> doesn't work, because a parachute's effectiveness is based on its area.
<div class="indent"><strong>Adam:</strong> I'm roughly 6 feet at 180 pounds. Proportionately, that's 72 inches to 180 pounds. 10 inches tall... 25 pounds. I just did the math. I need him to weigh 25 pounds. <br/><strong>Jamie:</strong> So what you're saying is, he needs to be made of depleted uranium. <br/><strong>Adam:</strong> Uh, do you have any? <em>[looks at labeled shelves behind him]</em> Is it under "D" or "U"?
</div></li><li> Later used correctly in the Lead Balloon myth. Adam and Jamie's small-scale lead-foil balloon didn't float up specifically <em>because</em> it was too small (as they explained on the show). When they scaled the balloon up to a much larger size, the ratio of volume to surface area became large enough for the balloon to float—in fact, they actually needed to mix <em>air</em> with the helium to keep the foil from ripping from too much buoyancy.
</li></ul></li><li> Actually played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> and by extension <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> move like hulking slow behemoths as they should.

Although <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> is a weird situation: according to some tech specs from the box, the original Megazord weighed 172,000 pounds-86 tons — and was 333 feet tall, whereas it's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> counterpart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyoryuSentaiZyuranger">Daizyujin</a> was 41 meters tall, not even half the Megazord's height, and weighed 570 tons. Since succeeding Zords are likely of comparable stats, the world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> must have access to <em>unbelievably</em> strong materials.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> It is mentioned that creature who has his all dimensions doubled weighs eight times as much, but avoids the rest via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a>. Notably with the spells Reduce Person and Enlarge Person, for which there is an equal increase/decrease in Strength and Dexterity, respectively, but only minor ones considered the shift in mass (mainly for balance reasons).
</li><li> Somewhat ignored in that a creature's lifting capacity does not typically scale directly with the creature's mass. For an 8 times mass increase for an extra size category, a creature typically receives a 6 times increase in carrying capacity. It gets worse when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a>, as spells such as Enlarge Person increase the creature's weight by the usual eight times, but only increases their carrying capacity by approximately 2.6 times.
</li><li> There is an artifact in the <em>Book of Vile Darkness</em> called the Despoiler of Flesh that gives you very flexible control over a creature's shape, but more or less points out that it has to be scientifically plausible or the creature will die because of an unsound anatomy.
</li><li> In editions where flight maneuverability is mentioned, it's noted that the largest dragons become far less agile as they grow bigger. In 3.5, for instance, Small or Tiny dragons have Average maneuverability, Medium, Large, and Huge dragons have Poor maneuverability, and Gargantuan or Colossal dragons have Clumsy maneuverability — basically, the largest dragons will bank like cruise liners in flight, and are completely unable to pull off things like hovering or flying backward. And while they do get faster, it's nowhere near proportionate to their size; a dragon the size of a sperm whale travels only twice as fast as one the size of a border collie. Of course, the fact that said dragon is able to get off the ground at all is violating this trope pretty hard. One sourcebook explains that dragons get off the ground through a mix of ridiculously strong wing muscles, surprisingly lightweight bodies, and the fact that dragons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalEmbodiment">partly elemental</a> (hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a>), which gives them a lot of energy to spare.
</li><li> Older game supplements often gave the existence of massive creatures like giants, rocs, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Big Creepy-Crawlies</a> a handwave by stating that such creatures were connected to the innate magic field of the planet that helped sustain them beyond the limits of what bone and muscle alone could accomplish even if the being had no other magical abilities. It was suggested that were they were to find themselves transported to a world that lacked any innate magic (which was much stronger than what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> effects in the game), they'd instantly perish.
</li></ul></li><li> When RoleAids released <em>Giants</em>, a vintage third-party D&amp;D supplement, they took this trope into account, rationalizing giants' physiology with honeycomb-framework bones, radically different leg musculature, and super-tough hide to contain their extremely high blood pressure. Oh, and a heaping dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a> (or rather The Gods Did It) for titans.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Imperial Titans and Baneblades, and Gargants, and Squiggoths, and Hive Tyrants... thanks to 40k's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>-powered physics, it's likely cumbersome size can always be counterbalanced by the number of guns bolted to it.
</li><li> Taken to hilarious extremes with the Hierophant Biotitan who, despite being as large as a warhound, is supported by 4 relatively tiny stalks it calls legs. How it doesn't explode from its own weight is anyone's guess. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kmj9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1kmj9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kmj9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It's implied that the Hierophant is a very powerful Psyker, but has to dedicate all of its psychic power to maintaining a Warp Field, giving it a powerful armor save while at the same time maintaining its structural integrity.</span>. Unsurprisingly its model is one of the most fragile non-dark eldar ones in the whole line.
</li><li> Averted in a few places, though. Space Marines are about 8 feet tall and almost 8 feet WIDE, with numerous extra organs, and a giant suit of power armor to help take the strain of their larger proportions. Of all the factions to get this right, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">ORKS</a> versions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMecha">Titans</a> (called Gargants) seem reasonable. Either they have very widely spread out feet, or tank treads to move about, and it appears most of the weight is concentrated towards the ground. Also, if anyone has the right to ignore the square cube law, it would be the Orks, since their technology relies heavily on their innate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> to work in the first place.
</li><li> The Square Cube Law is actually referenced by Imperial Biologists, who are astounded that creatures the size of a Squiggoth can exist (in their own words, it should collapse under its own weight and be completely incapable of movement, though such knowledge is likely cold comfort to troops staring down one charging at their lines). The only other faction to field super-huge creatures is the Tyranids, though both groups have in-universe explanations (the Tyranids make use of genetic engineering and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a>; the Orks just get to fall back on their usual excuse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">"thinking it's real makes it real"</a>, which explains why Squiggoths only show up in large Ork warbands).
</li><li> The Tau initially only fielded relatively tiny Mini-mechas in the form of Battlesuits; one-pilot mechas roughly 10-12 feet tall to carry heavy weapons on an infantry scale. They scoffed at the idea of Imperial Titans, whom they thought that the huge amount of resources and manpower to keep one of those things running proportional to just, say, bring a massively huge gunship or artillery is just ludicrous and chalked it up to Imperial Propaganda. One Damocles Gulf War later they realized the humans <em>were</em> crazy enough to make titans and despite the impracticality of it, their effectiveness were unparalleled. This led to the development of the Riptide, Stormsurge, and titan-esque Ta'unar Supremecy Armors
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em> fails to take this trope into account with the Garou and other shapeshifting races. A Garou's crinos form height is 150% that of their homid form height, with significantly more mass. Ironically, a Garou's dexterity <em>increases</em> in crinos form, when it should logically decrease. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">It's because they're part-spirit</a>, probably.
</li><li> It's a bit of a standing joke among <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> fans who have done the math that despite usually weighing anywhere from twenty to a hundred tons, given their physical dimensions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">BattleMechs</a> must be less dense than water and should therefore logically float, especially since they're <em>also</em> by default environmentally sealed so they can operate in vacuum and other hostile environments. The rules, of course, still have them <em>wading</em> through any water deep enough to be worth depicting on the map. The square cube law exists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, but its magnitude is reduced, with the upper scale of feasible battlemech tonnage capped at 100 tons; you <em>can</em> build them larger ("superheavy"), but then they are barely able to sustain their own weight and move at a snail's pace even with an enormous reactor. Only three superheavy designs exist, and only two of those were functional designs — the 110 ton <em>Matar</em>'s design team was executed for "treasonous incompetence" as the mech could barely move under its own power.

The fantasy-absorbing nature of Gensoukyou would actually allow for one to exist inside of it, and Sanae becomes convinced that the giant shadow she saw is one.

Large Robot Masters and their counterparts from the spinoff titles can jump much higher than your character and pull off some moves, even if they aren't equipped for flight. However, large bosses in the later portions have size and power, and can manage limited movement, but they can't maneuver for crap, sticking them in basic movement patterns most of the time.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> series the bosses of the opening stage are generally titanic Mechaniloids with the maneuverability of a brick and are much weaker than their size would dictate. The few exceptions are Gigantic Mechaniloid CF-0 from X2, which could jump extremely high and hit pretty hard; Egregion from X4, a huge dragon Mechaniloid that could fly very fast; and Mega Scorpio from X7, a centaur-like scorpion Mechaniloid who could turn and charge fairly quickly.

During the Giant Battles he's probably closer to being 8-10 times bigger than normal. This trope is played surprisingly straight, as Bowser's normal ability to "dodge" attacks is completely removed. This being Bowser, he doesn't waste time dodging and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">opts to punch the foe over and over</a> until <em>someone</em> falls. The one time the weight issue is brought up is in the Fawful Express battle, as Bowser will fall through a wooden bridge and lose if he takes too long.
<ul><li> Whenever he shrinks again after the fight, he realistically shrinks towards his centre of mass — resulting in him falling several feet to the ground that is now far below him.
</li><li> In other Mario games, Bowser's size changes virtually every second or third game. One time the issue of the floor breaking beneath was during the final battle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a> 5</em>'s story mode. Bowser uses a potion to grow twice as large, then instantly crashes through the floor beneath him. The rest of the "fight" plays out with him stuck in the floor.
</li><li> One other thing to note is that Bowser is shown to float or levitate whilst giant, suggesting that he may at least be aware of the impracticalities of this trope.

<ul><li> Huge monsters made of metal like bronze or steel are strong enough to support their own weight (which is suitably high because it is calculated by the game based on their size and material) and are extremely durable, but that same weight also makes them relatively vulnerable to damage from falls. Very large grazing animals that have been domesticated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">are also almost impossible to keep because they need so much grass to eat.</a>

He should realistically weigh 3 or 4 times that. They seem to have realized this when putting him into the game proper, however. Croc moves extremely heavily, and a very powerful freight elevator struggles to slowly grind upwards with him in it. Without him, it moves much faster.

They are pretty slow and wobbly on the ground though, due to having to deal with the gravity. Additional details mention that their shields are a fraction of what they can maintain in space (which can take the firepower of an entire fleet without a scratch), due to the incredible drain by their mass effect cores.

Furthermore their figure seems to be bulkier, than the average human. That would mean, that they weight at least 650 pound (300 kg). To maintain that body weight, a similar built 6-feet man must be able to lift at least 330 pound (150 kg).

It weighs only 398 kg (877.4 pounds). For comparison, a male sperm whale averages 16 meters (52 feet) long and weighs 40 tonnes (45 short tons). In fact, doing the math shows that Wailord is <em>lighter than helium</em>. Float Whale Pokémon, indeed. Though that would explain how they can participate in land battles without collapsing under their own weight.

Amusing, if one tries to build a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> mech mentioned above, it'll have about the same density of styrofoam (or <em>less</em>) which will cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreakingHavok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreakingHavok">the Havok physics engine</a> to freak out.
</li><li> An archaeology project in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> mentions that an Ogre once thought to use Rylak's as mounts. While it managed to make a comfortable saddle, Ogres are so large (about 15 feet tall and very fat) that it'd take a mount the size of a small mountain to remain airborne while carrying one, to say nothing of the question of how a creature of that size would manage to stay airborne in the first place.
</li><li> The Dark CPUs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegadimensionNeptuniaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegadimensionNeptuniaVII">Megadimension Neptunia VII</a></em> blatantly disregard the law, being EVA-sized monstrosities with humanoid proportions, but since they appear and disappear on a whim and destroy the fabric of reality when they attack, this is the least strange thing about them. It's given a nod nonetheless when Arfoire takes direct control of one — the protagonists note they've got plenty of time before she catches up, since Afoire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">has no idea of her new body's physics and keeps tripping over</a>.
</li><li> When realistic physics engines started to come into vogue, a lot of game designers (most of whom had an artistic rather than engineering background) had to call in architects to assist in designing their in-game environments as their buildings and constructs would literally collapse as soon as the physics were activated as they were unable to support their own weight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em> has a lot of very large animals wandering the surface of Mira. Most of the enormous creatures are shown to have very large organic gasbags keeping them aloft, like living blimps, but the Millesaurs and Coronids are just plain gigantic four-legged dinosaurs. The in-game fluff explains the Millesaurs as having a surprising amount of their bulk consisting of an internal bouyant gas sac, which means they are a lot lighter than they look.
</li><li> Goliath-class machine lifeforms in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> such as Engels or Grun are massive in scale (with the former being the size of a building and the latter being 1000m tall kaiju-sized monstrosity,) but they move like they're drowning in molasses and their melee attacks are slow and exceedingly easy to dodge (unfortunately, the thing that makes Grun so dangerous isn't his size, but the massive EMP blasts he emits.) At one point you fight two Engels at once in the City Ruins and the battle, combined with the Engels' sheer weight, eventually creates a massive sinkhole in the center of the map. However, this is subverted with Hegel, a giant flying centipede-like machine, though it's possibly justified with a throwaway line elsewhere in the game about the machine lifeforms utilizing anti-gravity devices. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hegel is also a weaker version of the cloned Emils, who are also capable of flight, though in this case the justification is that Emil and his copies are all magical in nature.</span>

One example is Phaedra, where its multi-ton weight is supported by ridiculously thin points at the end of its legs. A creature that size shouldn't be able to get up with those spindly legs or even use them as a stamping weapon. It's explained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">A Wizard Did It</a> reasons, since their world has obvious supernatural elements incorporated into it.

</li><li> Kingprotea has the ability to infinitely grow and her default mode easily beats everyone else in height, including the aforementioned Ivan. She also primarily teleports to the enemy to attack them. It's explained that the digital world of SE.RA.PH lets her circumvent this law and she can just keep growing without consequence, but it takes effect when summoned in the real world. She has to activate her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalWorld">Reality Marble</a> in order to use her bulk in the real world.

However, not only can Tiamat replenish it as fast as they can destroy it, but she then surprises everyone by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">growing a massive pair of wings from her back and beginning to take off into the sky</a>, with everyone incredulous something so big could do that.</span> In this case, the being in question is so mind-boggling powerful it basically gives the middle finger to physics in the first place on top of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who literally can't die unless she's the last living thing in the world, meaning she can ignore such technicalities.</span>

Raz dwarfs the city, and due to his immense weight, he moves slower, jumps lower, can't use Levitation, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDrowningSkills">can only bounce off water two times instead of the usual three</a>.
</li><li> One of the trials in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has your party fighting a dragon that is as large as a settlement. Because of its huge bulk, it moves very slowly as it advances towards Ishgard and its attack animations also have a bit of a wind up. If you mistime shooting the dragonkillers (huge harpoons) at it, the dragon will jump several feet in the air to dodge it despite its size. Certain battles can also affect the player's size, which has them moving a little faster when shrunk and a bit slower when made bigger. The trope is also zig zagged with the player character races; the dwarf sized Lalafell race have faster movement animations while larger races like the Hrothgar have a slower gait to their movement. All races control and feel exactly the same to keep things consistent and even among all players.

Possibly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a>.
</li><li> One of the classic explications of this idea, although never actually mentioning the term "square/cube law", is J.B.S. Haldane's "<a class="urllink" href="http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/papers/right-size.html">On Being the Right Size<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".
</li><li> Some breeds of dogs which have been bred for size are easily susceptible to numerous health issues that smaller dogs do not, from joint pain to heart problems, while smaller dogs live longer on average. Similarly, leaner people tend to have fewer health issues than overweight or very muscular people, because they have less weight to carry around. In general, larger species live longer, as it takes more time for them to grow, but smaller individuals of a species tend to live longer, as they have less mass to support.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wadlow">Robert Wadlow<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who stood <em>8'11"</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24kdq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24kdq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24kdq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">about 272 cm</span>, provides a good example of what happens when people try to get that big. Namely, serious physical problems requiring him to get leg braces and walk with a cane, having little feeling in his lower body, and dying at age 22. His cause of death was closely tied to his size: a poorly sitting brace irritated the skin on his foot, causing a blister. Due to his lack of feeling he did not notice this, and it got infected which led to his death. The tallest man alive, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_K%C3%B6sen">Sultan Kösen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who is eight inches shorter, has undergone gamma-knife therapy to stop growing, and still walks with crutches.
<ul><li> Similarly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AndreTheGiant">André the Giant</a> was in constant pain for most of his life because of his gigantism and the strain it placed on his body. It eventually killed him, though he still lived more than twice as long as Wadlow.
</li><li> Major League Baseball did a full examination of the heights of every player since 1880 and their age at death and discovered that every INCH taller a person is has a significant negative impact on life expectancy. The difference between 5'7" and 6'0" is almost 8 years.
</li></ul></li><li> Rather depressingly, beached whales die because their own body weight on land, without any support from water, crushes their lungs, causing compressive asphyxia (i.e. they cannot breathe under their own weight). Some cases of stranding have had the animals die due to drowning — their stomachs were crushed, and the animals vomited their food.
<ul><li> This can also happen to the larger varieties of sharks, who are not only massive but have flexible skeletons made almost completely out of cartilage. Their bodies are simply not capable of supporting their own weight out of the water.
</li><li> On a slightly lighter note, weight is the reason why the largest whales gain nutrition by a less energy consuming method by filtering plankton into their mouths while swimming around. If they had to actively and aggressively hunt down food the same way their smaller cousins like orcas and dolphins do there is no way they would gain more energy from it than they had to spend moving their massive bodies around when chasing their prey. Sperm whales are the obvious exception, actively hunting their prey including enormous squid at extreme depths, despite being enormous themselves. Not as enormous as baleen whales, but still quite large.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nazis were getting hammered in the tank battles on the Eastern Front, so they decided to build a scaled-up tank, with armor thick enough to shrug off enemy tank shells, and guns big enough to one-shot enemy tanks. The "Maus", as it was ironically called, weighed 200 tonnes, was 10 metres long and 3.71 metres tall. The tracks were 1.1 metres wide — more than half its 3.63 metre width — in order to try to spread the load, but it still tended to sink if the ground wasn't completely firm. The designers had a difficult job designing (and then redesigning) a suspension system strong enough to support the weight, and finding an engine big enough to drive the whole thing — in the end, more than half of the Maus was occupied by powerplant and transmission, and it still wouldn't go over 13 kph. Crossing bridges with that weight was out of the question, so it was designed to be able to ford rivers, completely submerged if necessary. It was to have a 150mm main cannon. Unfortunately, they were unable to do anything about it destroying roads and damaging nearby structures simply by its weight and vibration. In the end, only two prototypes were built. That's not all, though. Plans were on the drawing board for a <strong>1,000 tonne</strong>, 35 metre long Landkreuzer with a 12" main gun, infirmary and toilet facility, and its big brother, the <strong>1,500 tonne</strong>, 42 metre long "Monster" Landkreuzer with a 32" inch main gun. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a>, indeed!
</li><li> The principle holds even for more practical tanks. T-34 and the Sherman were only marginally larger than the Panzer IV, yet they weighed nearly 10 tons heavier. The Panther was yet again somewhat larger than the T-34 and the Sherman, but heavier still by more than 10 tons. Many German generals thought the advantages of the larger Panther were not worth the penalty imposed by the heavier weight. Guderian in particular believed that the long-cannon Panzer IV was the best tank Germany produced during the World War II. The debate continues as Russians kept on producing smaller, lighter, cramped, cheaper but still fairly powerful (for their size and cost) tanks compared to their Western counterparts.
</li><li> Another Nazi failure was the planned demolition of Berlin to build, among other things, the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkshalle">Volkshalle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, to be the center of "<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welthauptstadt_Germania">World Capital Germania<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>". Meant to contain 180,000 people, it was basically a scaled-up version of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome">Hadrian's Pantheon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which Hitler greatly admired. However, it was so big that the water vapor exhaled by its occupants would have created clouds and rain — assuming the entire building hadn't already sunk into the swampy ground. In Berlin, there remain a few gigantic concrete test cylinders the Nazis cast to see if the soil could support the Volkshalle's weight. Proving real life has a sense of dramatic irony, these cylinders have been steadily (albeit slowly) sinking for sixty years.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a> had several projects of similar magnitude. The most famous of these is the Palace of the Soviets, which would have been the tallest manmade free-standing structure in the world at the time, had it been completed. It was to be built on a place of former Church of Christ the Saviour, which was demolished to free the space for the Palace. The top of the Palace would feature a 30-meter statue of Lenin. It was cancelled when the architects finally got over their fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Stalin</a> to tell him that the building would simply sink into the ground (there are underground streams in Moscow). The designs were instead used to build five scaled-down structures. The place instead was made into a very nice giant open-air swimming pool with free admittance; until finally in 1990s the pool was demolished, and the original structure occupying the spot was reconstructed  namely, the lush and astronomically expensive Church of Christ the Saviour, with a giant underground conference hall, parking lot and other amenities for heads of rich Russian Orthodox Church.
</li><li> Millions of years ago, bigger creatures were able to walk the Earth thanks in part to the greater concentration of oxygen in the air. Insects in particular have an inefficient way to carry oxygen to their cells. Back when there was more oxygen, they were able to push the envelope on size — there were dragonflies with 3 foot wingspans, for example. Nowadays, the same insects would suffocate. Nowadays, as always, the insects grow to whatever size the local atmosphere supports, so all it takes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigCreepyCrawlies">Big Creepy-Crawlies</a> to return is a bit more oxygen.
<ul><li> There is a theory which states that at the time of the dinosaurs Earth had lower gravity (for whatever reasons), but it doesn't get a lot of recognition.
</li></ul></li><li> Elephants often break bones just from tripping and falling over.
</li><li> Large-sized skydivers are advised to rather perform the parachute landing roll instead of attempting to land on their feet if the landing appears to be rough or downwind. The square/cube law means the larger you are, the harder you fall and more probably sprain your ankles on rough landings.
</li><li> Square Cube law was often cited by proponents of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></em> being a scavenger and not a predator, many people assess that should the <em>T. rex</em> trip (as often happens to predators in real life), it would sustain crippling or lethal injuries. Others point that the <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, while fast enough to catch up to larger prey, would not have been nearly as fast as smaller predators (like raptors), which could have lessened the damage in a fall. It may have also employed strategies (like ambushes) that may have lessened the need to to run, thus the risk of falls. However, it is now discovered that tyrannosaurs were a lot more lightly built than previously thought, increasing their speed and efficiency as a predator. Also, it is believed that their diet changed dramatically through their lifetime. At old age they may well have been scavengers or more like specialist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSteal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSteal">kill-hijackers</a>, like male lions. It is also believed that <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> and other large dinosaurs were perfectly capable of getting upright again should they have fallen down, most likely by shifting their centre of gravity to get back on their feet similarly to how resting birds stand upright.
<ul><li> Imagine how slow sauropods would have been due to their gigantic sizes. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkingWithDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WalkingWithDinosaurs">Walking with Dinosaurs</a></em> animators found that <em>Diplodocus</em> would have to keep three feet on the ground at all times or they would trip over while designing early models.
</li><li> Early paleontologists believed that large dinosaurs lived in swamps, because they approach being too large to move under their own power without the buoyancy of water. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>, and discoveries of new fossils or rethinking existing ones led to new schools of thought about dinosaur lifestyles, muscular and skeletal makeup, and even posture. Note that no land-dwelling dinosaurs were ever as large as certain sea creatures, though (except the near-legendary <em>Amphicoelias fragilimus</em>).
</li><li> It is now known that sauropods have hollow yet strong bones and air sacs just like theropods (particularly birds), which enabled them to grow such a huge size without getting too heavy.
</li></ul></li><li> Dwarf species of deer and antelope, such as the muntjac or duikers, tend to have legs so skinny it's hard to believe they can stand upright, let alone run. Even species weighing over a hundred pounds can leave footprints the size of a kitten's. Compare that to the soup-dish feet of a moose or giant sable antelope. This is also visible in dogs: the legs and feet of a Chihuahua are far more skinny than a moderately sized dog like a Beagle.
</li><li> Ants and other insects are a classic example. While actually weak compared to say humans under a strict application of the Square Cube Law, they easily trump a linear interpretation of size to strength. Ants can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">lift/drag as much as 50 times their weight</a>. Fleas can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InASingleBound">jump 200 times their height</a>. A strict application of the law would have ants lifting thousands of times their weight. This difference is attributed to the fact that evolution forces larger things to have a higher percentage of muscle, and the different scaling rates of the anatomy such as the digestive system and neurology, etc. etc.
<ul><li> It's not even necessary to adjust for scale. In absolute numbers, a cricket can jump much higher than an elephant, because this law works so much in its favor.
</li></ul></li><li> Oblong objects suffer drastically from heat transfer over the area versus length. Therefore the largest snakes, such as anaconda and pythons, are pretty much confined to tropics where the temperature is high and constant throughout the year. The square/cube law is also the reason, why reports or 30 m or 100 ft or whatever long anacondas are hoaxes: 9 m is pretty much the maximal thermodynamic length of a snake living in current atmosphere and climate. The reason why there has been larger ophidians, such as <em>Titanoboa</em> is that the climate was much warmer then and able to sustain such bodies.
</li><li> There is another scaling effect. The resistance in a vascular system is inversely related to the fourth power of its radius.
</li><li> 9/11 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">Conspiracy Theorist</a> Richard Gage once had a demonstration as to why the Twin Towers would not collapse. He took two boxes representing the "top block" of the Towers and the bottom block. He then dropped the upper block on the bottom, to simulate the building failing in the impact zone due to fire and impact, and the top portion falling on the lower, collapsing it. Since his model did not collapse, he asserts, it meant the Towers would not have collapsed. Some "debunkers" calculated that the model he used, being a few feet tall, would be something like thousands of times proportionately stronger than the 1000+ ft. Towers, especially once you take into account that the model was made of cardboard. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Curiously enough</a>, Gage and his organizations largely act like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFVoencqfZw">the video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> doesn't exist. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvuKUmK9eB0">He resurrected the argument in the wake of the blacksmith rebuttal clip that made the rounds in 2016, though.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Body Mass Index formula bases your healthy weight on the <em>square</em> of your height instead of the <em>cube</em>. This is not an accurate representation of human mass vs. height at all. The formula was made for the average man, and it fails when it comes to dealing with women, children, and outliers such as very short or very tall people. BMI does not distinguish muscle weight from fat weight, so some bodybuilders and athletes qualify as "obese" despite having lower body fat percentages.
<ul><li> A mathematician noticed this and posted <a class="urllink" href="http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/bmi.html">a letter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> pointing it out. It turns out that even the inventor of the Body Mass Index knew that his formula wasn't very accurate. Squaring works best for children, cubing works best for babies, and an exponent of 2.5 works best for adults. These values are generally related to the composition of body mass over the human lifespan up until physical maturity.
</li><li> Some BMI calculators do have allowances for large or small boned people, but even these consolations should be taken with a grain of salt. Often these are just flat percentages.
</li><li> A newer standard called BVI (body volume indicator) uses a 3D scanner to measure one's dimensions. Unlike BMI, it takes one's volume and distribution into account, providing a more accurate measure of obesity.
</li></ul></li><li> You see this all the time with young children, compared to adults. Notice how often young kids run around at full speed, fall down... and bounce right up and take off again. Or the number of times toddlers fall when learning to walk. They thump themselves, and, yes, occasionally draw some blood or get some quite impressive bruises, but their injuries are <em>far</em> less severe than what an adult would suffer going through a similar motion. With their low mass due to this trope, they just can't impact the ground with enough energy to cause more than minor damage (admittedly, being low to the ground and having less time for gravity to accelerate them downward is a factor as well). Small children are also likely to be able to do exercises like pull-ups without any training or effort, as the strength-to-mass ratio is much more favorable than for adults fully grown.
</li><li> Whilst the size of yachts is announced by their overall length (LOA), expressed as ft or m, their prices tend to rise exponentially rather than linearly in relation to their length. The reason is the square/cube law: the yacht price is relative to her displacement rather than her LOA, and increases in <em>cube</em> of the LOA.
</li><li> Ships of various types can often get larger and larger over time due to this. The main reason: A ship's drag comes from waves and water drag, water drag increases as the square of the length. However, the amount of stuff a ship can carry squares as the cube of the length. This means the proportion of space needed for engines, fuel, and such to push it through the water gets smaller as the ship size increases, leaving more room for other things, and saving costs. As a result:
<ul><li> The first ocean going steamship was deliberately made larger than usual at the time, partly to avoid the need to refuel as a result of this effect.
</li><li> Container ships today are known to get bigger and bigger, limited only by available port infrastructure and by the size of canals, if the ship must travel through them.
</li><li> Exploitation of the cube squared law was the driving factor of the race to build the largest luxury liners that dominated ship building from the late 1800s to the 1930s. As a liner's size increases, the amount of free space to devote to more rooms (and thus more paying passengers) increases much faster than need to expand both common rooms and machinery necessary to propel the ship. However this was also a driving factor behind the Titanic Disaster. Laws at the time required lifeboats based off of tonnage rather than total number of people the ship carried. The proportions specified in the law were calculated assuming much smaller vessels, which meant far less efficient use of tonnage. When super ships like the Titanic rolled around, the law's requirements for lifeboats were horribly behind actual passenger capacity.
</li><li> This is also the reason why racing yachts tend to be long and sleek. The wet area of the yacht is relative to her waterline length and her beam, and the narrower the beam, the smaller the wet area and the drag it causes. Conversely, the longer the waterline, the greater the hull speed. This comes with a price, though: racing yachts are extremely spartan and cramped and uncomfortable to live in. Leisure yachts tend to have broader beam and dramatically more spacious living quarters.
</li><li> Replace cubes and squares with cylinders and circles and you have the driving factor behind the dreadnought race in the prelude to WWI. The difference between a twelve inch gun and a fourteen inch gun doesn't sound like that much but it equates to a much larger, heavier shell. The heavier the shell, the more explosives it holds, and the more armor it can punch through. So every time one nation came out with a battleship that could tote guns even half an inch bigger than the previous ship, all the other nations had to make a ship with the armor to withstand that firepower armed with equally large guns. This process was so vicious and rapid that many battleships were considered obsolete before they were launched. This eventually led to the Battlecruiser concept, skipping the extra armor in exchange for speed but keeping the size and big guns; the idea was popular but in the actual war they proved to be too much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> to fulfill a Battleship's combat role.
</li><li> As engine design improved, battleship performance improved as well, leading to the Fast Battleships that would dominate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. These ships were bigger, more heavily armed, <em>and</em> faster than the Dreadnoughts and Super Dreadnoughts of the First World War, which ironically made them ideal escorts for the aircraft carriers, thanks to their mix of speed, range, durability, and room to mount <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">lots and lots of anti-aircraft guns</a>.
</li><li> This is also why supercarriers exist. Despite people constantly criticizing the concept and saying it would be more efficient to use many smaller aircraft carriers. While it would divide the eggs over a greater number of baskets so to speak, it would far more expensive and there is no way the many light carriers would ever be as versatile. As expensive as a super carrier is, building and maintaining one big ship is always more efficient than many smaller ones. Never mind that a supercarrier can launch very large aircraft when needed for odd jobs and a light carrier just cant.
</li></ul></li><li> Huge machinery (as in the 1000-tonne tank example above) are limited in size and agility by environment far more than by engine power.
<ul><li> While <a class="urllink" href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/__zoKJ77EvEc/TKX-BOfZaGI/AAAAAAAAH2M/wrDypHZAEa0/bagger_14%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800">giant, thousand-tonne mining excavators<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had been built for decades, motors made to drive them and track surface wide enough to avoid sinking into the ground or even leave tracks on the ground, they still have the <strong>inertia</strong> of their gigantic mass. This is why they are limited to a snail's pace: decelerating their mass by striking a rock, for example, would bend steel like cardboard, turning in place from a reasonable speed would throw a track. They are "movable", yet never truly "mobile".
</li></ul></li><li> This is why, until a certain point in time, horses couldn't survive a broken leg — there was simply no casting material strong enough to carry around that much weight until the bone fully healed.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32bpp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note32bpp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32bpp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The alternative would be to keep the horse immobile for several weeks, which is both highly impractical and causes its own problems.</span> This improved somewhat with technology, in that it raised the chances of survival from "somewhere below absolute zero" to "possible, if the horse is very very lucky and the circumstances are right".
</li><li> This trope can have interesting effects on ship and aircraft design. Samuel Pierpont Langely was one of the contenders for the first heavier-than-air controlled manned flight. He built a series of unmanned <em>Aerodrome</em> scale models which were successfully launched from a water-based platform (he decided to design the landing gear once he had the actual flying figured out). He scaled the design up and installed a more powerful engine for the first manned version, which upon launch promptly crashed into the water along with the test pilot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolName">Charles Manly.</a> Nine days after his second failed attempt, the Wright Brothers had their first successful flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. However, the Aerodrome was later successfully flown, in 1914.
</li><li> A very significant example in real life would be the sun itself. Amazingly, the incredible pressures and temperatures in the sun's core are barely enough to ignite any hydrogen fusion at all (relatively). Taking the total power output of the sun and dividing it by its total volume gives a ridiculously low specific power output of 0.28 watts per cubic metre. As 99% of the sun's power is produced in the inner 10% that forms the core, the peak power production due to nuclear fusion is just 276 watts per cubic metre which is about the same as... <em>that of a compost heap.</em> Yes, <a class="urllink" href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/birth.html">the sheer power output of the sun is actually due to its tremendous size; its sheer mass means even insanely low percentages of hydrogen burnt still turns out to be 600 billion tons of hydrogen burnt every second.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The surface luminance however is another story as it depends only on the surface area. Despite its low power density, the sun is an incredibly luminous object (~2 <strong>billion</strong> cd/sq.m at the surface, a laptop screen is just around 200-300) because of the square cube rule. A quick calculation shows that a brisk runner by comparison generates around 10000 W / cu.m of body volume, therefore a sprinter scaled to sun-size would in theory generate 50000 times more energy than the sun and become one of the most powerful stars in the entire galaxy. However, the body heat generated by all the cells of a sun sized runner at normal biological rates would cause his body surface temperature to reach an incredible <strong>74000 K, hotter than even the most luminous star</strong>!
<ul><li> This also creates problems for nuclear fusion in the laboratory, that not having the benefit of immense masses of plasma or gravity, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion">artificially created plasmas need to achieve 10 to 100x the temperatures in the sun's core to achieve any reasonable power output at all.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> For that matter, even <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R136a1">the most luminous star ever known still radiates at a measly 53 Watts / cu.m (over its TOTAL volume) and it's still 7.4 million times more luminous than the sun<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Evolved stars show also very well the effect of the square-cube law. In red giant and red supergiant stars, evolved medium and (not very) high-mass stars, while the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan-Boltzmann_law">Stefan-Boltzmann law<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ensures they emit quite less energy per surface area than in their less bloated past a much larger area more than compensates for that being up to thousands of times more luminous. However, except for the diminutive core that must be <em>really</em> dense and hot in order to maintain nuclear reactions beyond standard hydrogen fusion, their masses are spreaded over such a huge volume that their mean densities are <em>very</em> low, pretty much similar to a vacuum. Conversely, white dwarfs and neutron stars, corpses of low/medium and high mass stars with the sizes of a planet and an asteroid respectively, pack in such a volume the mass of an entire star meaning <em>extremely</em> high densities, and have so little area that they're very faint despite having, when formed, much higher surface temperatures than any typical star (see the Stefan-Boltzmann law before).
</li></ul></li><li> If smaller astronomical objects are your thing, an enhanced version of this law also applies to planets. There's a reason the moon, Mercury, and Mars are geologically dead, while Earth and probably Venus are still active. Geological activity is created by heat leaving a planet, the area through which the heat can leave is proportional to the square of a planet's radius, but all common sources of heat are proportional to <em>greater</em> than the cube of the radius: Radioactive heating is proportional to mass, which increases slightly faster than the cube of the radius (due to gravitational compression, a heavier body squeezes itself). Accretionary heating increases as mass squared, tidal heating goes as radius to the fifth. More heat per surface area means more geologic activity, and longer lasting activity, than a smaller planet made from the same materials in the same orbit and location.
</li><li> It's observed in powerlifting that the lighter weight classes will lift more weight as a percentage of their actual body weight than heavier weight classes. While the 300+ lbs super heavyweights can squat 1000 lbs, 150 lbs and under weight lifters can approach squat weights nearly five times their own bodyweight. This is probably because the lighter lifters are generally much shorter, and their short bones cause the weights being lifted to act across a shorter lever arm, making it easier to lift.
</li><li> Architecture, of course, deals with this. The invention of the arch in Rome enabled them to build some massive projects, including bridges and aqueducts. One of the biggest issues in medieval England was that their cathedrals kept collapsing. The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_buttress">flying buttress<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> solved that problem.
</li><li> It's even observable with toys. Given the same material and proportions, a smaller doll or action figure will generally hold an awkward pose — one which puts frictional stress on the joints, <a class="urllink" href="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/095/743/4865229287_224920e9d9.jpg">such as standing with knees bent<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> — much better than a large one. This trope is also one of the worries involved in large and expensive figures, such as Hot Toys collectibles or Masterpiece Transformers — they're so heavy that something like falling off the shelf, which wouldn't even scratch a small toy, could seriously damage a large one. Bandai's luxury divisions, such as S.H. MonsterArts, managed to bypass this problem by adding additional attachable transparent support parts and stands to provide some extra stabilisation where required.
</li><li> This law can be clearly seen in astronomy, where the larger the lens of a telescope the better the resolution and the more light it can catch (and the more expensive it is due to how difficult is to manufacture a large lens, a stronger mount to take care of extra weight, etc). For example, the price hike from a 4-inch refractor (lens) telescope to a 4.7-inch one is not much, but it is much higher from the latter to a 5.9-inch,just to have a 50% extra light and 25% more resolution, and prices go <em>astronomical</em> for larger lenses. Mirrors in reflector telescopes are easier to manufacture thus not as subject to this.
