He was the first guy, especially one around her own age, who was kind and gentle to her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingBully">Semimaru</a> later points this out, wondering if Natsu would love him, had <em>he</em> been nice first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AbsoluteDuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AbsoluteDuo">Absolute Duo</a></em>: Miyabi fell for Tor because he was the first guy she ever met (once she entered puberty) who treats her Gag Boobs as merely part of the package known as Miyabi Hotaka and actually cares for her thoughts and feelings as a person. When she collapses on the track and field, he stands by her and helps her recover. When she sprains her ankle, he carries her to the infirmary. When she's feeling down, he offers words of encouragement. All without ulterior motives. For someone with Miyabi's life experiences, this means a lot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi">Ai Yori Aoshi</a></em>: Mayu ended up falling in love with Kaoru because he cheered her up when her own parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">couldn't make it to her birthday party</a>.
</li><li> This is why Jun develops a crush on Takumi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheAnthemOfTheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheAnthemOfTheHeart">The Anthem of the Heart</a></em>. Having been friendless because of her elective muteness, he's the first person to stand up for her and befriend her, no matter how unwilling he was at first.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ymir cites this as the reason for her devotion to Krista, claiming that Krista could smile at her even while knowing what a horrible person she really is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This devotion leads her to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and side with the villains since they need Krista alive and are the ones best suited to ensure her survival in the long-run. That they will probably end up killing Ymir either way is fine with her, as long as Krista survives.</span>
</li><li> This is why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Female Titan/Annie</span> decided to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">spare Armin</span> during their ambush on the Survey Corps. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Annie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen">is not a very approachable person</a></span>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Armin</a> is the only person who makes an effort. Because of this, Armin is the only person <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's actually relatively close to</span>, and this is presumably why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she has him unhorsed and caught as the Female Titan, she lets him go rather than squishing him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGoodDeedGoesUnpunished">This ends up biting Annie in the ass later: Armin uses this encounter as a clue to connect her to the Female Titan</a></span>.
</li><li> Mikasa's unwavering loyalty and devotion towards Eren stems from the day that he rescued her by ruthlessly murdering a group of human traffickers who killed her parents at great risk to himself.
</li><li> After learning of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ymir Fritz</span>'s tragic past, Eren pulls the little girl in a comforting hug, and tells her that she is free. It is the first time <em>anyone</em> had shown kindness to her instead of ordering her as a slave. This is a crucial point of the story because it enables Eren to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">access the Founding Titan, and activate the Rumbling to destroy the world, as punishment for abusing Ymir's powers and legacy.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Ennis of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> whose creator treats her like garbage, tries to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sacrifice her own life</span> to protect the first people who were ever nice to her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A third party jumps in and saves her</span>.

<ul><li> Minami likes Akihisa because he asked her to be his friend when she couldn't make any because of the language barrier; of course, this being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Aki</a>, he asked her in French instead of German. Likewise, her little sister Hazuki likes him because he saved up 25,000 yen just to buy her a doll.
</li><li> A large part of the reason Shouko loves Yuuji is that he was the first person to ever treat her like a normal person while everyone else was fearful of her status as a rich girl.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Bakemonogatari">Bakemonogatari</a></em>, one of the reasons why Hitagi Senjougahara asks Koyomi Araragi out. Koyomi was the only one who genuinely wanted to help her with her problem (though it doesn't help that Hitagi threatened everyone else who tried).
</li><li> A villainous example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: the torturers under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Bishop Mozgus</a> reveal to Farnese that they are all deformed, ugly outcasts of society until Mozgus took them under his wing and made them his torturers. While they admit that they personally have no great liking for the job, it's the one time in their lives that they've been treated with respect of any kind, and Mozgus was the only person who ever reached out to them without looking upon them in disgust and horror.
</li><li> Snake in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>. He was close to the circus crew because they befriended them despite his appearance, to the point he would attempt to kill Ciel when all his friends disappeared, thinking that Ciel was the cause of their disappearance. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He wasn't entirely wrong as Ciel's staff killed the circus crew for ambushing Ciel's mansion.</span> He would eventually become loyal to Ciel after Ciel takes him in and like the circus crew, didn't care about his snake-like appearance.
<ul><li> Finnian admits his admiration and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> towards Ciel came from the latter welcoming him in his home and giving him a job as a gardener when he previously led a wretched life where he was a test subject in human experimentation.
</li></ul></li><li> Possibly the case with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild">Creepy Child</a> Gretel of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>. Since, by the end of her arc, it seemed that the only other human beings she actually liked were her brother and Rock. This is because Rock, the only truly decent human being in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of Roanapur, listens with sadness and horror rather than disgust at the coldly delivered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingSpeech">Breaking Speech</a> of Gretel, a little girl so traumatized by rape and torture with her twin brother Hansel back in Romania that murder has become the sole source of joy for them. He holds her in a tight embrace and weeps, begging her to accept the possibility that there is hope, and still a possibility of a new and happy life for a little girl like her. This act of sincere kindness, so alien to Gretel, was enough to move even a mass murderer like her to blush like a real little girl for the briefest of moments... leading to one of the saddest moments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">Evil Cannot Comprehend Good</a> ever. Her version of thanks was to offer herself sexually to Rock, thinking that is the only way an adult will appreciate her in return. Before she left Rock she stated happily "I hope we can meet against someday mister! We can have a picnic!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker">Sadly,</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was shot in the back of the head by a guy with a revolver immediately afterward, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">karma catches up with her</a> for having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">pissed off Balalaika</a> for torturing two of her men to death alongside Hansel</span>.

He goes as far as threatening Botan with a knife just to make his point about not harming any of the brothers.

The Wolkenritter would have been loyal to Hayate regardless of how she treated them due to her being the Master of the Book of Darkness, but since Hayate showed them kindness (and viewed them as her family), they were willing to go <em>against</em> her wishes in order to save her life rather than follow her request to leave the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Book of Darkness</a> alone and leave her to die.

In a flashback, it turns out that the reason why was because she felt isolated since no one wanted to associate with her due to her status, and when she tripped and fell, Takumi was the only person who offered to help her back up. Eventually, she does become a part of their group.

</li><li> When they first are properly introduced to one another, Kanna disliked Kobayashi because she thought Kobayashi "stole" Tohru away. After Kobayashi was able to see that Kanna couldn't go home because she was exiled and needed Tohru, Kobayashi offers Kanna a place in her home to stay.

When she went to meet him in person, Gentle accepted her without another word, allowing her to use her computer skills to improve his videos and even drawing dark circles around his eyes in an effort to match her own and cheer her up. Gentle's own narration shows the feeling is mutual, as he was also a depressed shut-in until La Brava introduced herself and befriended him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Haku was fiercely loyal to Zabuza because the older man said he had use of Haku's abilities.
</li><li> Kimimaro was perhaps even more fanatic in his loyalty to Orochimaru, willing to sacrifice his soul and body as the man's next vessel or, failing that, dying to secure the one who would become his vessel. And all because Orochimaru was the first person to ever show him kindness.
</li><li> Karin spends about a quarter of the series following Sasuke's every order and lusting after him, even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheHostage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheHostage">he tried to kill her</a> and called her useless. Later on, we found out that sometime during the Chunin Exams, Sasuke saved Karin from a bear. The anime expans by noting that she was just used for her healing abilities (like her mother before her) by her village and Sasuke saving her was one of the first acts of kindness she got (also a surprising example of just how far Sasuke fell.)
</li><li> A variation also appears with Neji Hyuga, who, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarArc">Fourth Shinobi World War Arc</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifices himself</a> to protect Naruto and Hinata.

In reality, it's because Naruto was too important to the world, and Hinata was too important to both Neji and Naruto to lose on a personal level — Neji because she is his cousin, and Naruto because she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">one of the most important people</a> in his circle of friends.
</li><li> Speaking of Naruto and Hinata, this is a key part of their strong friendship <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and eventual romance</span>, as they always treat each other with respect and kindness, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather">they each were treated harshly by the people around them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">in their childhood</a>—for Naruto, it was nearly the entire village; for Hinata, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">it was her own family</a>, until Naruto beat Neji for her at the Chunin Exams finals.

<ul><li> Nezumi's devotion is actually even simpler than Shion taking care of him when injured. Nezumi is attached to Shion because when he was cold, injured, and lost all hope, Shion opened a window. According to Nezumi, at the time that simple action was like "a miracle" to him.

Yet she still convinced herself that in spite of their kindness, they would still eventually abandon her simply for the fact that the entire world itself was her enemy. When they proved her wrong by declaring war on the <em>entire world</em> just for her sake, it was only then that Robin realized that, after twenty long years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">she had finally found her place</a>.

</li><li> This is part of the Straw Hat Pirates general philosophy, as they don't <em>have to</em> go around helping people, but when someone simply does something nice for them (no matter how small the act) in a world where pirates are generally feared, scorned, or hunted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">they will stop at nothing to help them no matter the risk</a>.

Despite being warned, by the Slit-Mouthed Woman herself no less, that familiars could easily turn on their masters, the Woman (named Amelie by Mai) appears to be extremely loyal to her master for no other reason than the fact that Mai worries about her and treats her like a living person and not just a pile of data.

<ul><li> In the manga we got his absurdly complicated backstory. Knives stepped in coincidentally while, as a kid, Legato was being raped to death in punishment for a plot to kill everyone he hated (which was a lot of people).

Then he more or less swore his allegiance on the spot and gave Knives permission to kill him now if he wanted. And Knives asked him his name, which was the most anyone had ever treated him like a person because he <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsDehumanizing">didn't have one to give</a></em>. And then Knives let him tag along after he killed everyone at the facility. And eventually gave him responsibilities and a budget and things.

Effectively Mariko was merely acting in accordance with the ethic and social rules of her class, but it still was the first time Rogue was unreservedly welcomed by anyone since she left the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, and so in the following issue Rogue shows no hesitation to lay down her life to prevent her death ("Lady Mariko was kind t'me — she accepted me, right off — ah won't let her come to any harm!"). The fire from Viper's blaster actually hurts her badly, but Rogue accepts her likely death philosophically.

<ul><li> There is an old fairy tale where a young man who wants to woo a princess heads off to do so. On his way there, he meets an old man with whom he shares his meal. When the young man makes it to the castle, the girl's overprotective father sets an impossible condition for him to do so; he must produce a man who can eat a mountain of bread. When the young man is wandering through a forest bemoaning this task, he meets an old man who says he is incredibly hungry; the young man tells him of the mountain of bread and the old man then offers to help and eats the entire thing. The king then declares that the boy must produce a man that can drink an entire warehouse full of ale; he goes back to the forest and meets the man again, who this time claims to be incredibly thirsty and drinks all the ale. As a final task, the king demands that the boy produce a ship that can sail on both water and land, and when the distraught young man returns to the forest one final time, his mystical friend invokes this trope.

</li><li> Harry is also always quick to remember the kindness and support of his friends, and one of the things that makes him genuinely angry is seeing them insulted. On the train to Hogwarts after the battle at the Ministry of Magic, he's sitting with Neville and Luna when another student invites him to another car to hang out with the kids there, saying he doesn't have to sit with Neville and Luna. Harry coldly rebuffs the offer and it's clear that he's <em>seriously</em> pissed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserFriendPuzzlesOutsiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserFriendPuzzlesOutsiders">Luna observes that people expect him to have cooler friends than them.</a>

Unfortunately, as Harry and Ron nearly find out firsthand, this courtesy extends <em>only</em> to Hagrid.
</li><li> This is definitely one of the series' recurring motifs. Imagine how different Harry would have turned out if Hagrid hadn't been the first person in his life to show him any kindness. It was Malfoy's contempt for Hagrid in Madame Malkins that really kicked off their animosity. The same goes for when he taunts Ron, Harry's first-ever friend, on the train. If it weren't for Harry's loyalty, would he have accepted Malfoy's offer of friendship and been put in Slytherin instead? The entire series would veer off course....

</li><li> The theme of "The Legend of the Latchstring", depicted in both a short story and a mural at the Pennsylvania Legislature. Amid rumours of a raid by local natives, a Quaker family pulled in their latchstring (a rope used to lift the latch inside their farmhouse door from the outside). Quaker custom was that it would never be pulled in, the equivalent of always leaving your door unlocked. Initially, they did, on the advice of non-Quaker neighbours, but the guilt over betraying their beliefs led them to let the string back out. Sure enough, later that night, native raiders burst through their door...then exited almost as quickly. Years later, when in a peace circle with one of the raiders from that night, they learned why: leaving the door unlocked demonstrated that they were Quakers, known to the local natives to be the only white people to welcome them with open arms.

At first, it seems like a subversion, with Jean Valjean taking advantage of the Bishop and stealing his stuff. Then, when he's caught running from the Bishop's home with the good silver, the Bishop decides not to press charges and gives Valjean the stuff, plus a bit more, on the condition that it "buys his soul for God". Jean Valjean is converted from a bitter convict to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">The Paragon</a> of integrity and virtue for the rest of his life, despite all the crap he endures, out of loyalty to the Bishop's one kind act.

She was willing to die to save him, all because he helped her come back from being evil while everyone else hated her (mainly because he understood her, seeing as he was in the same situation about 100 years previously). In season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>, this is the reason why she refused to even try to kill Angelus and in <em>Angel and Faith</em> she is still very loyal to him. Faith also does this with Gwendolyn Post. (Faith loves this trope.) Also, another reason why she helps Angel in Season 9, is because she really wants Giles back, since he was nice to her, too.

</li><li> The 19th century Zulu leader <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ShakaZulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ShakaZulu">Shaka</a> grew up in a village where he and his single mother both suffered continual bullying from the locals. As leader, Shaka returned to the village and had all the bullies put to death by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">impalement</a>, as slowly and painfully as possible - with one particularly awful woman getting shut in a hut with starving dogs before the hut was put to flame. Those who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">had not actively bullied them, but had allowed it to happen</a>, were put to death more quickly and less painfully. Only one man was spared because Shaka remembered him being nice to his mother.
</li><li> John Tharpe owned a slave plantation in Jamaica. He was noted in both Europe and the island itself for his respectful and dignified treatment of the slaves he owned. When a slave rebellion broke out, many plantations were put to the torch; guess whose plantation was completely spared.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JudyGarland">Judy Garland</a> mentored newcomer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneKelly">Gene Kelly</a> on the set of <em>For Me and My Gal,</em> his first movie; Kelly would later claim she taught him basically everything he knew about show business. Years later, when Garland came out of rehab and not many people would work with her, Gene requested her for <em>Summer Stock.</em>
</li><li> Criminals like kidnappers or planned shooters are inspired to turn their lives around on occasion because their victim or would-be victim treated them with respect.
</li><li> The Roman Emperor Caligula exploited this trope; he would set some of his slaves free and give them important positions within his Empire. The reason he trusted them with these positions was that they owed him everything they had, even their own freedom.
</li><li> The Ottoman Sultans used a similar strategy, ordering European boys kidnapped and raised to become his chief administrators and generals. This ensured total loyalty since they were wholly dependent on his patronage for their positions, and prevented aristocratic rivals from building up their own power base.
</li><li> During World War II, an Allied spy named Virginia Hall was arrested by Spanish police for being in the country with improper documentation (she'd crossed the Pyrenees in a hurry to escape infamous SS officer Klaus Barbie). While in jail, she nursed a young prostitute named Elena back to health. When Elena was released, she told the American consulate about Hall's predicament, and they got her out of jail.
