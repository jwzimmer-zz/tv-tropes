</p><p>Sometimes this character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">just duplicitous</a>, but is allowed to claim the title to keep the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> going for the greater good.

</p><p>The false attribution can occur on-stage, with the Fake Ultimate Hero getting credit for what has happened, generally over the actual character who did it, or off-stage, where the characters learn the truth (often the hard way) but the true heroes of those incidents are not characters.

<ul><li> Mr. Satan (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">"Hercule"</a>) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> is frequently credited as stronger than any other professional fighter, although this usually does not bother any of the main characters despite their world-saving ventures being unrecognized. However, a few characters are not above blackmailing him about the secret... Of course, he is the strongest normal human besides Yajirobe who doesn't know how to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">ki</a> when he first appears, and the good guys, in fact, would rather stay out of the spotlight, so it suits them just fine. When push comes to shove however, Mr. Satan is actually a rather decent and kind-hearted man who genuinely cares about people and wants to help them. He at least has the <em>heart</em> of a hero, if nothing else.
<ul><li> This is exploited in the fight against Kid Buu, where he manages to use his Fake Ultimate Hero status to convince every human on Earth to contribute their energy to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack">Combined Energy Attack</a>, saving the universe by doing so. Sometimes PR and the ability to work a crowd can come in handy.
</li><li> Even before that, he risked his life by running through a field of ki attacks to get Android 16's head to Gohan, which precipitated his ascension to SS2 and had managed to rehabilitate Fat Buu, an act which got Piccolo to declare that he was worthy of the title of Earth's champion. Granted, the latter didn't stick, but it was incredibly impressive nonetheless, and Fat Buu's intervention is the only reason that Goku got the time needed to charge up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinedEnergyAttack">Spirit Bomb</a>.
</li><li> Plus after Kid Buu was finally defeated, Mr. Satan managed to keep Fat Buu, who stayed loyal to Mr. Satan thereafter. That's right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKidWithTheRemoteControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKidWithTheRemoteControl">Mr. Satan controls one of the strongest people in the universe</a>.
</li><li> He surpasses the feat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, where he convinces most of the world's population that the planet is going to blow up and that everyone needs to evacuate to another one. Pan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">notes</a> that her Grandpa Satan could be a great hero if he'd just stop lying.
</li><li> Taken to new levels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>. Not only does he tells the world that he defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Beerus</a> and ascended to godhood, his fake hero status has spread across the universe. Aliens gave him a medal for "defeating" the God of Destruction.
</li><li> It is made quite clear that he is a genuinely talented martial artist (he won the Tenkaichi Budokai fairly in the years Goku and company did not attend), <em>and</em> does have a level of strength that is genuinely superhuman; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">he just happens to live in a universe where even the mid-level Mooks can punch mountains apart.</a>
</li><li> Weirdly enough, Mr. Satan is one of the very few characters on the show to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">have not died once</a>. When Super Buu unleashes his Human Extinction Attack (which does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">exactly what you think it does</a>), he didn't target Mr. Satan with it due to having fat Buu's memories of him. And when the Earth is eventually destroyed by Kid Buu, Goku saves Mr. Satan at the last minute. This actually makes him the <em><strong>only</strong></em> human to have never died, with the exception of Uranai Baba (who can travel to the afterlife at will, so she doesn't really count).
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His luck runs out by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, where he, along with most of the supporting cast, is killed by Frieza destroying the Earth. Though Whis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">rewinds time</a> shortly afterward, meaning he never even realizes it happened.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Amusingly enough, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonballXenoverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonballXenoverse">Dragon Ball Xenoverse</a></em>, Mr. Satan teaches the player one of the most useful skills in the game: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalTaunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalTaunt">"The Savior Has Come"</a>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrawAggro">pulls AI opponents off your allies and has them focus on you</a>. Considering the sheer number of missions in the game where you have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscortMission">protect woefully-poor AI allies</a>, this ability is practically required.
</li><li> Considering that all his victories are thanks to him exploiting his fame and connections in the world or genuine intelligence, all of which is only possible by keeping up the charade of being the world's most powerful fighter, a generous person could even describe him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a> rather than a mere fake.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> also introduces <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Monaka, an alien touted by Beerus throughout the Universe 6 arc as being the strongest being he ever faced off against.</span> Not only is all the hype surrounding him a complete lie, but he's not even strong by normal human standards like Mr. Satan, and spends most of the Universe 6 arc unconscious from fear at witnessing everyone else's power, which is passed off as him being in deep concentration. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Beerus just uses him as motivation for Goku to improve himself with the knowledge that there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a>. Ironically, Monaka ends up winning the Universe 6 tournament when his opponent Hit, who had just defeated both Vegeta <em>and</em> Goku, realizes how weak Monaka actually is and promptly throws the fight, both out of respect for Goku and contempt for his employer Champa.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Kitano, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelDensetsu">Angel Densetsu</a></em> is a Fake Ultimate Villain but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Real Hero</a> too. Unfortunately, his in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">bad PR</a> makes him a hero only to a very few people, or to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">Delinquents</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> there's the TV personality Don Kanonji, a self-proclaimed exorcist. While he <em>can</em> see ghosts and has some degree of spiritual powers (being roughly on par with Ichigo when they met), he doesn't really know how to deal with them. (In fact in his first appearance it actually <em>causes</em> an incredibly self-centered ghost to become a Hollow.) Forms a group of junior-varsity "superheroes" to protect the protagonist's hometown when they leave. Naturally, it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">kids who do all the work</a>. Unlike some, he is more likable in that he states that he does his actions in part to be an inspiring role model for children (hence standing his ground against the Hollow and even freeing a trapped Ichigo), and genuinely wants to make the world a better place.
<ul><li> There is also the fact that he stands up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aizen, who is in his second to most recent form, realizing how powerful Aizen is, in order to protect Tatsuki and Michiru.

He admits that he's not nearly as invincible as people thinks he is, but part of his image is being the hero who never loses and who everyone can believe in. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And his strength isn't naturally his.

They're treated as some of the most sacred warriors working for the Church and viewed with awe by the people, and being a member is something to be proud of... but, as it turns out, the Knights are so prestigious that they're basically never expected to see actual combat. Most of its members are just scions of various noble houses who bought their commissions and knighthoods, and use it as a way to get military service under their belt. If they were actually put in real danger, it might put those noble families in a tizzy when their heirs die in battle, so their duties are pretty much 95% ceremonial. Farnese, their leader, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JeanneDArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JeanneDArchetype">Jeanne d'Archétype</a> who had never been in an actual fight and was explicitly only a member because the Knights traditionally have a female leader.

The difference is while he does have all of Spike's recklessness, he has absolutely none of the skills or intuition to back it up. He repeatedly mistakes other people for the terrorist everyone is hunting for in the episode including Spike twice, and near the end of the episode when said terrorist manages to trap both him and Spike, Andy immediately cracks under the pressure while Spike manages to keep his cool and look for a way out.

<ul><li> Well, if you WANT to get technical, Mouri/Moore DOES eventually gain some competence in the detective field in later seasons, as he's later shown able to piece much of the case together but cannot solve it due to lacking hard evidence. Conan's crime-solving mainly comes from hunches and correct guesses regarding suspects, whereas Moore's method involves mostly evidence and little to no Gut.
</li><li> He's quite skilled at Judo and displays almost a frightening level of skill as a detective when the life of his daughter and/or Conan hangs in the balance. He at least has the potential to be a real hero, if he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">weren't such a slacker most of the time.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Sonoko Suzuki also gets a bit of this treatment as well due to the fact that she's the most common person Conan knocks out and solves cases through when Kogoro is unavailable.

<ul><li> A better example is Haruto Sakuraba, a mediocre receiver who is hailed as the ace of Ojou (the second-best school in Tokyo) due to his good looks and modeling contract. During the match with Deimon, Sena accidentally injures Sakuraba forcing Sakuraba to question his path in life. He eventually shaves his hair, bulks up, and becomes one of the best wide receivers in the country due to his height.
</li><li> There's also Kiminari Harao of the Taiyou Sphinx, a mediocre quarterback who would flounder if not constantly protected by the mammoth Pyramid Line, yet who has no problem getting all the glory for his team's success.

Delaz took Gato in just because he needs more protection when running away. Gato somehow idolized Delaz as a hero.

They're shown fighting in a city against an alien attack with an ad man watching in awe. Brought on by his old friends, the Kennedys, the man is stunned to learn the CDC is a massive fraud. Most have no powers, the "alien" is a guy in a costume and the whole thing was started to give the U.S. a push in a "superhuman arms race" and help public morale. While their stopping street crime and natural disasters are real, every "alien invasion" and "super-villain attack" is carefully planned out to have a minimum of property damage and no civilian deaths.
<ul><li> The comic kicks in when, during a fake "fight," Old Glory suffers a heart attack (from years of smoking) and dies, a seeming "casualty" of the fight. And when the adman decides to bring in a "colored" hero, many in the team are against it in brutal ways.

Though he does prove himself to be a true hero early in his career, later writers end up portraying him as a self-serving, fame-obsessed laughingstock that all of the big-name heroes (save for Wonder Woman and Superman) treat like crap, even when he does stuff like facing Doomsday by himself, in order to buy Superman and his fellow JLA time to regroup.
<ul><li> The current Booster Gold series takes this to a new extreme, as far as Booster being forced to throw away any and all chances of becoming a well-respected hero in order to be Rip Hunter's personal slave/super-hero, leading the guy into full-fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> territory, with elements of Mildred Pierce tossed in as far as Rip revealing to Booster that Booster must forever be known as a coward and a loser of a hero, so that his son (Rip) can reap the full credit and fame from all of Booster's work protecting the time stream. This on top of Rip purposely lying to Booster about "fixing" past tragedies, like saving Blue Beetle's life and preventing the Joker from crippling Batgirl. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">It doesn't, of course.</a>
<ul><li> The worst part is that Rip actually has good reasons for making sure Booster's reputation remains in the mud.

The Sentinel Seven are regarded as a fantastic super-team, extending from just seven to several more and the Young Sentinels helping out. But during a case, the cops note how all the Sentinel missions take place in space and the films of them are suspiciously staged. They also discover many of the "threats" the Sentinels fought either don't exist or overblown (a "fierce alien armada" are a race that just discovered the wheel). The dark truth: The Sentinels are a massive pedophile ring with the Young Sentinels a "grooming" operation. The entire squad is soon on the streets rounding the Sentinels up.

<ul><li> This happens to cowardly non-magical wizard Rincewind, due to exaggerated tales of his deeds told by his sidekick from previous adventures, Twoflower (while Rincewind <em>did</em> perform many of the "heroic" deeds attributed to him, they attribute to him a much higher level of competence and ability than he actually had, and neglect to mention the fact he was scared out of his gourd the whole time, and mostly got by on luck alone). Like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a>, Rincewind is horrified by the attention, because his admirers quickly expect him to perform incredibly dangerous deeds to save their country.
</li><li> His contemporaries at the Unseen University have a much more realistic idea of Rincewind's disposition, but he ends up being chosen as the man for the job anyway for two reasons: First, the word "Wizzard" on his hat is spelled the right way (compared to other solutions they were seeking for the riddle of the identity of the "Great Wizzard"), and second, Ridcully finds the common thread in Rincewind's experiences, i.e. none of it ever actually kills him.
</li></ul></li><li> Sergeant Jack Jackrum makes it clear that almost all of the heroics that the higher-ranking officers in the Borogravian Army are known for are actually his exploits, shirking the credit because he likes being exactly where he is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even more complicated by the fact that all of the said officers are <em>women, including Jackrum him(her?)self,</em> disguised as men.

<ul><li> Gilderoy Lockhart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></em>. Everything amazing feat he's reputably done in his entire career was really done by other witches and wizards that he had only interviewed afterwards, but he took credit for them by using the only magic he is good at: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">erasing memories</a>.
</li><li> Harry sees himself a bit like this because the incident that made him famous was actually his mother's doing and everything else he has been able to do he attributes to luck (though Hermione points out that he's the best in their year at Defense Against the Dark Arts, which he is). Unfortunately, in the same book, many people think that he is mad because he is saying Voldemort is back.

These lies even survive his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Death</a>.
</li><li> Nimrod Pennyroyal in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines">Mortal Engines</a></em> series rewrote the story recounted in <em>Predators Gold</em>, placing himself as the hero. In this way very similar to Lockhart. His lies were eventually uncovered, so that in <em>The Darkling Plain</em> when he really did do something worthy of recognition and wrote a factual account, no-one was willing to publish his book.

Subverted because a) by this point in the story, the reader <strong>knows</strong> Charming is a genuine badass, and b) he proves it by asking the other guy to shoot an apple off Charming's head, William-Tell-style.

</div></li><li> In Robert Asprin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth Adventures</a></em> novels, the protagonist Skeeve is one of these. It's less by design and more because the rumors of the genuinely impressive things he was involved in tend to leave out a) the other people who were there, and b) the fact that there was a lot more con artistry than vast magical power involved.
</li><li> Fernand Mondego a/k/a the Count de Morcerf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></em>. Everything he values — his wife, his military commission, his vast fortune, his title — he earned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">screwing someone else over</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidGemmell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidGemmell">David Gemmell</a> based most of his stories around this trope and it's an inversion. Many of his protagonists become legendary figures despite that they did not actually do the heroic deeds they are credited with or if they did those actions, they were for the wrong reasons. Others are truly heroic but are never credited because of politics, racism or because of their past history.
<ul><li> In <em>Morningstar</em> Jace Mace is a thief and a conman. When he robs some tax collectors, he tells them that they were robbed by Morningstar (to buy himself time to get out of the country). The story spreads and he is considered a rebel leader fighting the occupying army. As the story progresses he keeps playing the role in order to survive and slowly becomes the person in the legend. In the end, due to some magical time travel, he assumes the identity of the other legendary figure in the nation's history (ie he is both King Arthur and Robin Hood)
</li><li> Subverted in the person of Druss since he is in fact exactly what the legends about him say and more.
</li></ul></li><li> Comrade Ogilvy in George Orwell's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em>. Supposedly he sacrificed his life for Oceania but, in fact, he <em>never existed</em> and was only invented by the main character Winston Smith.

Many of the stories begin with a historical passage written by the Diplomatic Corps about how some important diplomat, by following the honored traditions of the Corps, was able to achieve some major diplomatic accomplishment. In truth, every single one of these accomplishments was really pulled off by Retief in his position as a junior assistant to said diplomat by ignoring standard diplomatic protocol in favor of doing something that might actually work. The people who officially got the credit generally either caused the problem, made it worse or did nothing of substance.
</li><li> In <em>Raven's Shadow</em>, Vaelin frequently encounters figures with grandiose titles like "The Hope of the Empire", "Trueblade", Shield of the Isles, etc., who are considered predestined saviours or mighty warriors among their people, and yet fail to put up any real fight.
<ul><li> "The Hope" is a particular example. He was the supposedly Gods-anointed heir to a continent-spanning empire, was universally beloved, and considered one of the greatest men alive. Everyone who actually knew him, or saw him in action, however, agrees that he had no business being on a battlefield, and if Vaelin hadn't killed him, somebody else would have.
</li><li> Ironically, because of these easy victories, Vaelin sees himself as something like this. He's a good fighter but by the standards of the elite order of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Warrior Monks</a> he grew up in, his skills are at best on the high end of average, and in fact, he's actually one of the worst at mounted combat. He's considered special because of his leadership ability, not his martial prowess. His notoriety is built largely on beating other men who had inflated reputations, and he's bemused by how in awe everyone is of him killing people who could barely hold a sword.

He isn't completely useless, but his biggest real asset is that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert">The Social Expert</a>.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a> short story, <em>Luck</em> is about a priest in Britain who, out of pity, took aside and instructed the weakest trainee in the military. The priest never expected him to actually get accepted into the military, except he did, because a test of asking him questions (noted to be hard questions) he was given questions that were easy or ones the priest specifically gave him the answer to. Afterward, he continued to climb through the ranks of the military using 100% blind luck, such as getting lost and blindly leading his troop over a hill and just happening to find a camping French troop and attacking them off-guard. By the time of the story's present, he is extremely well-respected and high-ranking in the military despite every one of his achievements being done through nothing but luck.
</li><li> This is the central theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostFleet">The Lost Fleet</a></em> series. John "Black Jack" Geary was a Commander in the Alliance Fleet who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightManIntheWrongPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightManIntheWrongPlace">just happened to be present</a> at an ambush by the Syndicate Worlds. He stays behind to allow the rest of the fleet to escape and then jumps into an escape pod as his ship is blowing up around him. A malfunction causes his pod to lay undiscovered for 100 years. He awakes to discover that the war he saw the beginning of is still raging, and he's lauded as the greatest hero in the history of the Alliance. Geary spends a lot of time in the books trying to convince people that he's not the hero they think he is. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation">He's a better man than the myth they created.</a>

He's known as the <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DrinkingGame/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DrinkingGame/TVTropes">HERO OF THE IMPERIUM</a></strong>, but in his memoirs (the novels are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">framed as such</a>), he claims that in reality he only acts heroic for the masses and spends most of his time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">making things comfortable and as safe as possible for himself or fleeing in terror</a> and mostly saves the day by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero">pure accident</a>. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> editor — one of the people who actually saw through his acting — points out that he <em>is</em> a skilled and inspirational leader and also brave when he <em>has to</em>, although blessed with the good/bad luck of being constantly thrown into bad situations (and his inflated reputation means he often has to go into the Jaws of Hell to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR">maintain his reputation</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">The author even admits to not knowing</a> whether Cain is really a cowardly scoundrel or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation">just doesn't give himself enough credit</a>, but suspects it's a bit of both. Motives and details aside, he <em>actually did</em> all the heroic deeds attributed to him. It's only in his very first story where he gets handed credit for a victory when he was really just running away and saved the day by accident when he stumbled into the enemy flanking force, in the others he just tries and fails to choose the safest assignments before saving the day where he does end up.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ETAHoffmann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ETAHoffmann">E. T. A. Hoffmann</a>'s "Little Zaches, Great Zinnober" is all this trope. An ugly, short and stupid boy is given a gift by a thoughtless fairy, making everything good and wise done in his presence being attributed to him. Also, everyone else has to suffer being accused of his numerous blunders.
</li><li> Metternich from <em>BALADA:<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASymphonyOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASymphonyOfEternity">A Symphony of Eternity</a></em> keeps trying to avoid battle, ends up in the most deadly fight, somehow manages to dodge death until victory, thus he's an acclaimed hero who gets shoved into even more dangerous battles.
<ul><li> They way his military career starts summarizes the character perfectly and deserves mention, by the man himself:"And that my readers, is how my inglorious career began, with poisoned drinks, crazy luck, a lot of pain, and my personal favorite stupidity and the eternal question of why such a combination exists and what it has against good and honest folk and me of course."

<ul><li> Kind of used in season five of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>.

Although this is just a manipulation, Spike does see himself as a hero and does help the helpless in this way.
<ul><li> Another take on this trope with season five is Spike the Fake Hero in the Shanshu prophecy. Inside the show, Spike has an equal chance of being the real subject of the prophecy, but seriously, the show is called <em>Angel</em>.
<ul><li> Then again, that makes Spike more disposable and thus perhaps a better candidate to get the "reward" of becoming human.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VIP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VIP">V.I.P.</a></em> is Valerie Irons was just a girl from a hot dog stand asked out on a red carpet event by a handsome actor. When a stalker attacked, the cowardly actor hid behind Val, who took the guy down with a lucky punch. To save face, the actor claimed Valerie was a highly-trained bodyguard. A real bodyguard agency (having just lost their boss) talked her into being their figurehead for business. Thus, the series has the team going about various adventures with Val (good-hearted but still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl">Valley Girl</a>) the one credited with all the work.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackAdder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackAdder">Black Adder</a></em> had a rare example of a Fake Ultimate Hero who really was brave and dashing and always won. Lord Flashheart (who appeared as an Elizabethan swashbuckler in season 2 and a dashing flying ace in season 4) was handsome, bold, admired by all, adored by the ladies, and laughed in the face of danger.

Bo finds out the person behind it is Tomoe, Musashi's sister. It turns out <em>she</em> was the hero who won the battle and when people assume Musashi (the elder son) did it, she let them out of honor, unaware her brother would turn into a major arrogant jerk who now believes the lie himself. She's trying to "save" him as if he tries to ascend as a fraud, he'll be cursed into a demon form. Bo and Tamsin end up proving to the clan how Tomoe was the true hero and Musashi is forced to spend his days working a menial job at the clan's restaurant to pay back all the money he spent wildly when he was the "hero."

But Simon confesses to friends Egg and Petal that he's actually been attending art school in Melbourne and doesn't know the first thing about martial arts.

Monk finds that his cousin Joey dropped Harold into the role after the real Frisco Fly died in a car accident that Joey stumbled on. Joey stole the gear, burned the car to destroy the evidence, then knocked Harold out at a parking garage, dragged him up to the roof of a 24 story building, and left him to slip and fall to his death (which failed as Harold hit an awning to break his fall).

However, Mace really is a good man. He tried to tell people what really happened, but when it was clear they weren't listening, he decided to roll with it and use his reputation to do some good and advance Inhuman rights. When the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. found out about the lies, he was even willing to come clean to the press, but Coulson decides that Mace is a hero regardless due to his willingness to risk his life to help others, and lets him stay on as the public face of the organization while Coulson handles things behind the scenes.

As it turns out, Tak is the one destined to take out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
<ul><li> Mostly because Tak fulfills the signs the prophecy says will mark the chosen hero <em>because it's the only way he can revive Lok.</em> Some prophecies would settle for a simple unlikely hero, rather than full irony.

Ironically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he catches on to the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a> Yuri wants to kill the Premier and take over the Soviet Union long before you do. You kill him on Yuri's orders, but then discover he was right and revolt against Yuri yourself.</span>
<ul><li> General Krukov of <em>Red Alert 3</em> is similar, giving the player a lot of crap while taking credit for any of your successes. When he works with the Allies he arrives late and with limited reinforcements, stating that you should have done all the work yourself by the time he arrived.
</li><li> The (in)famous Soviet sniper Natasha is the stuff of legend—literally—to the point where there's considerable debate over her very existence. The fact that she exists as a trainable unit only serves to increase the probability that "Natasha" is more than one woman.
</li></ul></li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMario">Paper Mario</a></em> game seems to have one of these. The original had the stereotypically British, pith helmet-wearing explorer Kolorado, who insisted that it was he who led Mario onto his multiple discoveries, not the other way around. <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> had the stereotypically Spanish, feather hat-wearing Flavio, a prissy millionaire who told stories of his own bravery while constantly proving himself to be a coward. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em> has Flint Cragley, the host of a nature documentary who portrays himself as the ultimate macho-man on his show, whereas in reality, he depends on his camera crew (and, inevitably, on Mario) to get him out of even the smallest scrape. All three of these characters also meet up with Mario in the fifth chapter of their respective games, making it clear this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a> affair.
<ul><li> <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> also has Rawk Hawk, the champion of the Glitz Pit. He trash-talks Mario, cheats in your championship bout against him, attributes Mario's victory to luck, and... is defeated by Bowser, who is himself pretty much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> in this game, in one attack.
<ul><li> Rawk Hawk is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrouchingMoronHiddenBadass">Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass</a> though; he's the chapter's penultimate boss and pulls some mean tricks, most notably jumping to the ceiling, out of the reach of most attacks. (He'd be considered a heel wrestler if one were to use real-life terms to describe him.) Furthermore, he's the toughest single enemy you'll have faced to that point (even your previous opponent, the Koopinator, who has a higher defense and a spiked helmet, has a significant and easily exploitable weakness).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> the player can encounter Luigi as an NPC in Rogueport between collecting Crystal Stars numerous times throughout the game, and each time he'll tell Mario long rambling stories about adventures he's been on while Mario's been on his, which often sound eerily similar to Mario's adventures. Talking to whatever partner he has at the time will usually reveal that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Luigi is either greatly exaggerating his exploits or sometimes making the whole thing up.</a> There's also an in-universe author creating a series about his adventures with even <em>more</em> embellishments.

He eventually outs himself and gives it to your party, admitting that he had just picked it up off the ground and just ran with being called a hero, though later in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> you can have an ending where Tata storms Magus' castle, only to face...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chrono, Lucca, and Marle, who laugh at him</span>.
</li><li> Pierre from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> is a cowardly weakling who insists that he's really <em>the</em> ultimate hero.

<ul><li> In the earlier expansion, <em>Burning Crusade</em>, Illidan managed to get the Fake Ultimate Villain treatment.

Ultimately he was beaten in the first content patch; the real ultimate villain of the cycle, Kil'jaeden, appeared two patches later.

Despite charging double what the other bodyguards charge, he gets a lot of repeat business and customers are said to never hire anyone else once they've tried him. To investigate, you pretend you're an ordinary person and you hire Orris to be your bodyguard. As he escorts you through Freeside, he seemingly comes across four thugs and proceeds to seemingly shoot them dead, "proving" his worth as a bodyguard. If you have an Intelligence score of 6 or higher, however, you can point out that Orris fired <em>three</em> shots, but <em>four</em> thugs went down. Alternatively, if you have a Medicine score of 30 or higher, you can investigate the bodies and discover that the thugs aren't really dead. It turns out Orris hired people in advance to pretend to be thugs for Orris to fight, thus artificially drumming up bodyguard business for Orris.

Given that he was a featherweight fighter with seemingly dangerous punching power also added to his fame since featherweights weren't known to have power. He became the undisputed champion of the featherweight division, which was mostly filled with average to bad boxers at the time, but his string of multiple knockout victories and title defenses added to his fame, landing him big endorsement deals in Europe which made him richer than most famous boxers. However, it all came to an end when he faced his first true challenger in Marco Antonio Barrera who was a celebrated world-class boxer in the lightweight division; and a boxer Hamed had been calling out for years. When the fight finally happened, Barrera exposed Hamed as a fighter who lacked the basic fundamentals of boxing and only got by with weak competition and his punching power. He completely humiliated Hamed by the time the fight was over. Hamed left the sport afterwards never to return. However, he's ultimately a sympathetic example of the Fake Ultimate Hero, as he's still praised to this day for bringing excitement back into the sport of boxing when it seemed like it was fading away and dying as a sport. And he's still looked at as a boxing legend in many parts of Europe for his innovated ring entrances.
</li><li> The presence of one or more of these at a martial arts studio is a surefire indicator that you're looking at a McDojo or belt mill. If an instructor bills themselves as "legendary" or plays up their abilities or accomplishments in grandiose fashion (especially if they have an improbably high rank for someone of their age and experience level or repeatedly claims to be associated with eminent figures in the sport; a 28-year-old karate grandmaster or a Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructor who uses claims of training and/or sparring with Gracies as their main selling point should make <em>anyone</em> suspicious), that is a gigantic red flag for that studio. Belt mills are dangerous because they teach a terrible, watered-down version of the art that focuses on form and point fighting, <em>not</em> actual self-defense applications, and stories of people who trained at a belt mill, thought they were qualified, and then wound up getting pounded into Cream of Wheat or even killed when they attempted to employ their "skills" in a self-defense scenario (or, far less favorably, started a fight just to show off) and were shown firsthand just how ill-prepared they really were are abound in the martial arts world.
