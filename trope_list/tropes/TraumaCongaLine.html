You've created a hero so righteous, noble, good and pure that traumatizing them just once is not convincing enough to break them. Yet you want the intended audience to still feel like they want to reach into your work and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">hug the character</a> in question.
</p><p>Hence the name of this trope. You get ready to write, and put on a hat with the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw">"Murphy"</a> written on it, and think to yourself:
</p><p>"If traumatizing a hero once can earn the audience's sympathy, then what better way to earn your audience's <em>love</em> for the character than to lay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina">trauma after trauma</a> on them like a falling row of dominoes?"
</p><p>Having donned the hat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw">"Murphy"</a>, you, the creator of this fictitious universe, are entitled, nay, obligated to make sure that whatever can go wrong for your hero <em>will</em> go wrong. The effect is akin to the Chinese proverb of water continuously dripping on a rock: one drop won't even dent it, but a million will crack a boulder. In other words, having your hero lose everyone they love and/or have every dream unfulfilled and broken is the most realistic way to turn a God Amongst Men into a pathetic crying wreck.

She nearly freezes her little sister to death by accident while playing, receives a vision of her possible future where she is seemingly attacked by an angry mob due to her powers, grows up in isolation fearing both that and how her steadily growing powers could harm her loved ones again, loses her parents who were the only ones helping her with her powers and can't even go to their funeral without exposing her secret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionalPowers">Emotional Powers</a>, gets her powers revealed in public on the day of her coronation in the worst possible way, goes into self-exile after she believes that everyone sees her as a monster now, starts to accept her powers again only to learn that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">accidentally caused</a> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter">Endless Winter</a> when she ran away and she doesn't know how to reverse it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">accidentally strikes her little sister with ice magic again</span>, gets guards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle">storming her</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IcePalace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IcePalace">Ice Palace</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is nearly killed by the Duke's henchmen</span>, is chained and imprisoned, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is told that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDiedBecauseOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyDiedBecauseOfYou">her little sister had died because of her</a></span> and is nearly killed again only to be saved because of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her actually-not-dead little sister pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> at the very moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">she completely turns into ice</a>, so Elsa gets a front row seat to her very worst fear coming true. Fortunately, Anna's sacrifice actually saves her life, inspiring the epiphany Elsa needed to finally handle her powers</span>.
</li><li> Anna gets one as well. First her beloved sister shuts her out without any explanation (Elsa's powers are erased from her mind and kept secret from her), she's locked up in the castle as well - also without explanation, and becomes so lonely that she starts talking to paintings for company. Then she becomes an orphan and has to attend her parents' funeral alone, with her only remaining family still ignoring her without explanation. Then in the space of a day she has to endure her sister refusing her to marry <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">what she thinks is</span> her true love, having said sister reveal ice powers and flee the town while ignoring her pleas to come back, then later on reject all her attempts to reconnect and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> strike her heart with her ice powers, dooming her to a slow death, with Anna not even having any way of knowing this was an accident and not done in an outburst of anger</span>, and finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who she thought was her true love</span> reject her in the most callous way, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">telling her there is no one who loves her and leaving her to die</span>.

She starts by discovering that her sister is still keeping secrets from her and plans to go on a potentially dangerous journey on her own. Then Kristoff leaves without a word.

<ul><li> In <em>Ragnarok</em>, Thor finds out Loki is alive and replaced Odin as ruler for four years, when he reunites with his father, Odin dies minutes later and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">he learns about Hela</a>. When he and Loki confront Hela, she casually destroys Mjölnir and a brief scuffle sends him to the edge of the universe.

He can't even hear someone say Thanos's name he's so traumatized by it all.
</li></ul></li><li> Several of the traumatic things that Thor went through also happened to Loki, with a few additional things:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Thor">Thor</a></em>, Loki accidentally discovers that he is adopted and the biological son of the king of Jotunheim, Asgard's arch enemy. The discovery leads him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">despair</a> and eventually to a suicide attempt.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em>, after the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>, he is sentenced to a lifetime in prison (that is in his case, 5000 years) and is forbidden from ever seeing his mother again. A year later, when his mother is killed, he is not allowed to attend her funeral. On top of that, her death might be partially his fault, something that causes him great grief. He manages to avenge her and usurps the throne from his father, something that he thought he ever wanted.
</li><li> However, four years later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorRagnarok">Thor: Ragnarok</a></em>, Thor discovers his charade. The brothers go looking for their father, find him in Norway, and Loki is confronted with the consequences of his actions as Odin dies after acknowledging Loki as his son and telling both his sons that he loves them.

</li></ul><ul><li> Vada from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyGirl">My Girl</a></em> goes through this.

She was the one who angered the bees in the first place, and he only went back to try and find her mood ring that she lost, her father is the coroner, the funeral is held at her house, and to top it all off, on the day of said funeral, she discovers the teacher that she had a crush on is getting married.</span> It's quite understandable when she ends up having complete breakdown, although some would argue that it's a bit surprising that it wasn't worse.
</li><li> Well, let's see what happens to Kotpun, the heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFlowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFlowerGirl">The Flower Girl</a></em>. Her father dies. Her mother becomes deathly ill. Her brother is sent to jail. And her sister is blinded. And that's all in the backstory. As the story unfolds, her mother dies, her brother is reported to have died in prison, and her sister is presumed dead after disappearing without a trace. And just for fun, she's dirt poor, hence the name of the movie, as she's selling flowers in the street to get medicine for her mom.
</li><li> Ella goes through one of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015">Cinderella (2015)</a></em>. First her mother dies when she's only a child. Then years later her father re-marries, only for it to turn out that her new step-family are absolutely horrible people, who make Ella move into the attic after she selflessly offered for Anastasia and Drisella to share her room with her. Then her father leaves for a long trip, only for <em>him</em> to die, too. THEN Lady Tremaine is only concerned about the financial aspects of her husband's death, fires all the staff at the country house, then makes Ella their servant and they all constantly bully her. Then the one thing that Ella gets excited about, the ball, is dashed after her stepmother forbids her to go and cruelly ruins her mother's dress. It's amazing that the poor girl didn't reach the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a> stage much sooner than she did.
</li><li> What happens to poor Thymian in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiaryOfALostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DiaryOfALostGirl">Diary of a Lost Girl</a></em>. Namely: raped. Impregnated. Imprisoned. Baby dies. Drugged, raped again. Three years as a prostitute. Husband kills himself.

</li><li> In <em>Santa's Little Helper</em>, a character in the beginning of the movie gets fired, his girlfriend dumps him, his car gets towed away, and he gets informed that his house is being foreclosed upon, all within a matter of hours. There is no indication that anything was wrong beforehand, which seems to imply the movie believes that losing your job means losing your bank account and gaining additional debt immediately.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Quadrophenia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Quadrophenia">Quadrophenia</a></em>, Jimmy in short order gets arrested in a fight in Brighton, kicked out of his parent's house, loses his job, his girlfriend, his mates, gets his scooter wrecked, and eventually finds out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">his idol</a> is a common bellboy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLifeOfOharu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLifeOfOharu">The Life of Oharu</a></em>: Oh boy. One doesn't go from daughter of a samurai and resident of the Imperial court to wandering beggar in one step. So what happens to Oharu? Well—she's caught with her lover, and banished from the court. She's sold to a lord as a concubine. She's ejected from the lord's house after bearing his son, the heir. She's hired at a brothel, only to get kicked out of that for not being obsequious enough to clients. She gets a job as a domestic, only to get fired from that job after her past as a sex worker comes out. She gets married, but her husband is murdered. She applies to be a nun—but she's raped in the monastery, and the mother superior catches her while she's being raped, so she's kicked out. She's reduced to being a streetwalker, but eventually she gets too old and unattractive to even do that. Oh, and in the meantime she's promised that she can live with her grown son, the new lord, only for that promise to be broken. So, all around, a feel-good laugh riot.

Thanks to the machinations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">C/Max Denbigh</a> and Oberhauser, Bond and MI6 are even put out of business briefly.

Oh, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">his real name is "Stu-Pot"</a>.

Then she calls her old boyfriend for some advice, only to get another woman on the other end of the line saying, "Hang up the phone." Then she talks to her boss about working overtime or something, only to be told by the boss that she no longer has a job. With those three strikes against her, she then turns to a preacher and asks him to pray for her, and he just says "all of God's children got to deal with their own kind of trouble."

</li><li> Dionysus starts out with this as his backstory. His mother, Semele, is advised by a disguised Hera to get actual proof that the man who fathered the child Semele carries in her womb is Zeus. So Semele tells Zeus to show himself in his full divine glory, which burns her alive. Zeus sews the fetus into his thigh so the child can finish developing enough to be born, then after his birth calls him Bacchus, meaning the noisy one. Zeus gives the baby to relatives of Semele, who raise the child as a girl to throw Hera's scent off. Three years later Hera finds them, drives the adults insane and makes them kill the son they had together, after which they kill themselves in sorrow and little Bacchus only survives because Zeus turned him into a goat at the last moment so Hera didn't notice him. Then the toddler is shunted to the Island of Nysa, earning a new name: Dionysus, the son of the god Zeus living at Nysa. He's raised by satyrs and nymphs, then one day walking with a friend he sees a new strange plant. His friend goes to get it for him and falls to his death, and Dionysus with his power over plants makes the plant bear fruit, creating the first grapes then inventing wine. Trying to spread wine results in the first few kingdoms killing many of his followers including his nymph foster-mother, and almost Dionysus himself. After this, he changes his tone: he doesn't politely ask to be allowed to show you wine and grapes. You either allow him to introduce it to your kingdom or he will kill you with vines or drive you insane. Your pick.

Kohana doesnt kill Jinnouchi even though she knows she must. Her new teammate Isleen does by skewering Kohana through the back with her own sword to get at Jinnouchi. Worse still, Kohana tries to find the leader of the Shadows, an entity called the umbrakinetic, and finds <em>out it is her own mother</em>. Her mother then wipes the Earth out of existence, but not before telling Kohana how much of a failure she is, destroying their neighborhood, and killing two of her soldiers.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> presents two major examples of this:
<ul><li> Lapis Lazuli. Prior to her debut, she was forcibly trapped in a mirror for many years and only spoken to when needed. After being released, she tried to use the oceans to go back to her home planet, but was unable to do so due to her cracked gem. After Steven heals her, she is able to return to her home planet... only to find out that Homeworld had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">advanced so much</a> that she couldn't understand it. She is then used as an informant by Peridot and Jasper and taken back to Earth before being imprisoned again. After constantly being imprisoned, Lapis chooses to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">fuse</a> with Jasper after the latter was defeated by Garnet. However, Lapis then takes control of the fusion and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel">submerges herself and Jasper</a> in the ocean. Her control is slipping by "Chille Tid", before it's gone completely and they have to be forcibly unfused in "Super Watermelon Island". She gets better in later episodes, though there are nods to what happened, such as her desire to "take a break from water".
</li><li> It is eventually revealed that the entirety of <em>Steven Universe</em> fiction has been about a realistic look at the eventual physical and mental outcomes of repeated trauma, with Steven himself as the most thorough example. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">Steven Universe: Future</a></em> episode "Growing Pains", Dr. Priyanka Maheswaran asks Steven if he remembers anything "bad in [his] childhood that particularly stuck with [him]", and his response is to begin to recap the events of the original series, mentioning how he "...kind of freaked out when they canceled my favorite ice cream" and continuing with an absurdly long list of the legitimately terrifying things he experienced, including body horror, near-death situations, watching other people die, and abduction by fascist enforcers, before being interrupted. When Dr. Maheswaran is understandably aghast at this, Steven responds with "But that was just the early stuff!" against the visual backdrop of dozens of other scenes of physical and psychological threats. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The reason Dr. Maheswaran is examining him at all is because Steven has begun to experience gem-powered physical swelling as a result of his PTSD; the nightmarish circumstances of his youth have been catching up with him and have combined with recent loss of emotional support, so his emotionally-influenced powers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">going out of control</a>, and his body can't hold all of his stress at its usual size.</span>

And remember, this is <em>on top of</em> his life of poverty with alcoholic and drug-addicted parents, leaving his entire family to struggle just to <em>stay alive.</em>
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>: <em>Zuko</em>. First, his mother leaves him (to save him no less), then he gets challenged to an Agni Kai <em>as a thirteen-year-old, by his own father</em> who brutally scars and then banishes him, then he gets sent on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipeHunt">Snipe Hunt</a> after the Avatar. During said quest how much happens to our poor banished prince? (Read: Too much to list here.) And then when he finally gives up that quest, he has to fight his little sister in the shows only real deathmatch and take a lightning bolt in the chest to save a friend's life. He lives through it, but barely. <em>The next day</em> he has to start ruling his country, which he is effectively going to have to force through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, after theyve been at war with everyone else for a century. He was even destined to take on all that trauma from birth, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being a direct descendant of both the Fire Lord who started the war and the Avatar who opposed him. His destiny was to take on all the horrible influences from his father and co. and all the positive influences from his uncle and the Avatar, and come out of it with the understanding necessary to make the right decisions and have the right credentials to be the Fire Lord the world needed to rule the Fire Nation in the wake of the Avatars defeat of Ozai.</span> In a way all this trauma molds him into a much more complex character than the Avatar and allows him to fill a role that Aang could not, which ends up being almost as important or maybe even as important as Aang's own role in the story. It also makes him the thoroughly-adored <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woobie">Woobie</a> of the series.

In short, Korra has arguably been through more than <em>Zuko.</em> Thankfully, the last two are notable Result A's. She admits to Tenzin that all the suffering that she went through in the last two seasons made her a better and more compassionate person. Best illustrated by how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she saves Kuvira's life and, doesn't beat her down, but talks her into surrendering through understanding</span>.
</li><li> Asami also goes through a somewhat less severe one, also becoming Result A. When Asami was a child, her mother was killed by firebenders. She is strung along by Mako while dating him, only to lose him to Korra. She learns that her father, whom she looked up to, was working for the Equalists, and is forced to attack him, damaging the reputation of his company and their relationship almost irreparably. She has to take on the failing company; the guy she trusted to help her restore it steals the inventory.

You'd think things would be bad enough, with only 317 of the ship's nearly 1,200 crew surviving getting sunk by a Japanese submarine, then spending four days in shark-infested seas. Things got worse for the survivors when they found out that, at the very least, most of those who made it off the ship alive could've been saved. First, they were sent out of Guam without destroyer escort (which was standard procedure for the area). Then the ship's officers weren't informed that there were Japanese subs in the area (which had already claimed at least one Allied ship). Then when the ship sank, its distress call was dismissed by Allied command as a Japanese trap. <em>Then</em> when the Indianapolis failed to join the rest of the fleet in the Philippines, the ship was marked as "late" instead of "missing", so no search party was sent out. The survivors were found by a scout plane that happened to spot the oil slick from the Indianapolis' wreckage. <br/><br/>And just to polish things off, when people started demanding to know why the ship went missing for so long without being looked for, the Navy made a scapegoat of the ship's C.O., Capt. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._McVay_III">Charles McVay<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; court-martialing and convicting him of putting his ship "in harm's way" via his failure to maintain a "zig-zag" sail pattern. They even went so far as to call the Japanese sub commander that sank him as a witness (who called the "zig-zag" pattern useless). McVay was the only ship's captain in the U.S. Fleet to lose a ship and be court-martialed for it. (He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">committed suicide</a> in 1968.)

Frank<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a long conga line to the very end. On March 31, 1954, a furnace exploded at Frank's elementary school. The resulting fire killed 15 of Frank's classmates (including his then girlfriend Marlene duPont) and left him with burns on 50% of his body and life-long depression. In 1966, a year after his <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_C._Frank_(album)">first and only album<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was released, Frank developed writer's block and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">depression began to worsen</a>. In the '70s, Frank's son died of cystic fibrosis, deepening his depression and resulting in a stay at a mental institution. In the '80s, he traveled to New York in an attempt to find his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulSimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulSimon">Paul Simon</a>, but failed and ended up homeless. At this point, he regularly went in and out of mental institutions. In the early '90s, Frank was sitting on a bench in Queens when he was shot by teenagers indiscriminately firing a pellet gun, blinding him in his left eye. He died March 3, 1999 from pneumonia and cardiac arrest. A major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> indeed.

</div></li><li> One of the survivors of the Deepwater Horizon oil drill disaster made an escape that sounds almost fictional: The initial explosion sent a three-inch thick metal fire door slamming into him, and as soon as he was able to free himself <em>another</em> explosion sent <em>another</em> door straight into him, pinning him to the wall <em>again</em>. By that point he was starting to get angry. After watching all their fire drills go to waste by everyone panicking, he plunged two or three stories into the ocean which allowed him time to think about the fact that he had jumped from a place that wasn't on fire into the ocean, which was. When he got over being stunned by hitting the water, <em>hard</em>, he realized he wasn't dead because he felt a burning sensation all over his body; fortunately he wasn't on fire.

After the Confederates commandeered his house for use as a headquarters, his kitchen was destroyed by a Union cannonball. Afterwards, Wilmer decided to move to protect his family and ply his trade elsewhere as the Union Army made business difficult for him. He moved to a farm near the Appatomattox Courthouse, where Robert E. Lee would officially surrender to Ulysses S. Grant in Wilmer's parlor. After the signing, members of the Union Army looted all his furniture for souvenirs.

If the lightning wasn't bad enough, many people from hikers and friends to <em>fellow rangers</em> avoided him out of fear of getting struck. He committed suicide over an unrequited love in 1983, aged 71.
<ul><li> Special mention goes to strike #7 (June 25, 1977): Sullivan was fishing in a freshwater pond when, after being struck, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">a friggin' bear</a></em> <em>tried to steal his fish</em>.

</li><li> The tenure of University of Virginia president Teresa Sullivan has been mired in tragedy. She came into office as the university was reeling from the murder of a lacrosse player. Shortly afterwards, she was the target of a coup attempt. The 2014-15 school year saw it get worse, with another young woman being killed by a man tied to another murder at Virginia Tech, a now-debunked article from <em>Rolling Stone</em> about a gang rape on the campus destroying the reputation of a fraternity and several other people on campus, and a controversial incident involving a student being violently arrested and bloodied by the Alcoholic Beverage Control. In 2016, another student of theirs was taken hostage by the North Korean government where he suffered severe brain damage, and died shortly after he was returned to the United States. In 2017, the university was invaded by several white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups; violent clashes with counter-protesters ensured, and one of the white supremacists ran over several counter-protesters with his car, killing one.
</li><li> Several people who survived the deadly shooting at the 2017 Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas were also present at a country-themed bar in Thousand Oaks, California that was shot up about a year later. At least one of those unlucky people was killed in that shooting.
</li><li> As discussed by the documentary <em>Hitler's Circle of Evil</em>, Rudolf Hess's final actions under Hitler are almost enough to qualify him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">the fact that he helped Hitler get to power instantly removes said sympathy</a>. After years of loyal service, Hess had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> and felt ignored. He was also going through sanity slippage — for starters, he began believing in the paranormal, and at least once an employee found him trying to keep a tipped chair from falling over with only his mind. As Hitler and co. were trying to reach England, Hess came up with an idea, which he felt he couldn't disclose to anyone until it was already in motion — he left a letter that detailed this plan to be left on Hitler's desk the day after his departure. His plan was to fly to Scotland alone, and once there he'd meet with a lord he already knew — who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingStepsPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingStepsPlan">would then introduce him to Winston Churchill</a> so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Hess could convince England to surrender</a>. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">it didn't quite go like that</a>. Instead, the weather above Scotland forced him to bail the plane and parachute down. He landed on a field, where a random farmhand found him pretty much immediately, and only minutes later he had been captured. Meanwhile in Germany, Hess's letter had made Hitler <em>very</em> angry, which combined with the news of his capture led Hitler to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">cut all ties with him and ruin Hess's reputation with propaganda</a>. Once Hess realized how badly he had screwed up, he attempted suicide... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BungledSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BungledSuicide">only to fail at that too</a></em>, as the ledge he had choicen was nowhere high enough to cause damage more serious than a broken bone or two. Once the Nazis fell, Hess was incarcerated and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">later hanged himself</a>.
</li><li> The 60's and 70's was one horrific incident in the United States after another. A decade that started full of optimism turns into horror with the assassination of President Kennedy, a deeply unpopular war in Vietnam, the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. The 70's continued this with the public just how corrupt a president could be when Richard Nixon was forced to resign in the Watergate Scandal due to a tape showing overwhelming proof that he had clearly committed obstruction of justice, and the brief hope of Jimmy Carter managing to turn the nation around would result in the 70's ending with an oil freeze that left the nation grappling with a massive energy crisis and crippled economy and a revolution in Iran that would result in a hostage crisis that would severely embarrass President Carter.
</li><li> The life of the average <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanPopMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KoreanPopMusic">Korean Pop Music</a> artist is understood to be this, what with unhealthily restrictive diets, constant sleep deprivation, normalized physical and verbal abuse from higher-ups and the public, stalkers, getting mobbed to the point of injury on a regular basis, being expected to work through all manner of illness and injury (that often result from such an unhealthy lifestyle), low pay, scrutiny from the public for the slightest things, and that's just the things that are commonly discussed. Even among them, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NCT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NCT">NCT</a> 127's Yuta Nakamoto stands out for the severity and length of it, to the point where even his detractors concede he doesn't deserve what happened to him. After migrating from Japan to Korea at 16, leaving behind his family, friends, and a prospective professional soccer career, he he endured not only the backbreaking, soul crushing training all K-Pop trainees undergo, he contended with the isolation and homesickness that only being a teenager in a foreign country could inflict on someone. He had to learn a new language in a handful of years with absolutely no help. Also, unlike other Chinese trainees, who could find guidance and camaraderie among one another, there were no Japanese trainees under SM at the time, so he didn't even get that. When he was announced as a new member of a talk show, he was disparaged by viewers who assumed he was a clueless kid lacking the prerequisite knowledge and life experience. He became the single target of a notorious celebrity stalker. He was made to undergo needless cosmetic surgery that was not only painful, but quite conspicuous, leading to widespread scorn from the public, who made a meme out of his different appearance. In 2017, one of his closest friends left the label he was under. In 2018, a serious natural disaster in his hometown, along with no way to contact his loved ones and know if they were alive or dead, left him visibly anxious and distressed. In late 2018, his best friend and surrogate little brother was put in another group under the same label, forcing him to relive losing his closest friend. On top of that, he actively sought out his label, auditioned and trained as a vocalist, so that he'd be able to sing in NCT's music, and despite his obvious talent, is given barely any lines in NCT's discography, something he's openly lamented. He is frighteningly thin, to the point where his ribs are prominent, and fellow members have expressed concern for his extreme weight loss.

The century started with a brutal war with the Sassanid Empire that lasted for 26 brutal years that nearly saw the Empire conquered and left it economically and demographically devastated. After six years of peace, the Rashidun Caliphate burst out of the Arabian peninsula and proceeded to utterly devastate the Empire, inflicting crushing defeat after crushing defeat on the Empire's once powerful armies, especially at Yarmouk, causing the loss of Syria, Egypt, Armenia, North Africa, and a fair share of the Medditterean islands, along with parts of Anatolia. A siege of Constantinople that was defeated in 688, (and even then, the siege was more of a loose blockade rather than a genuine investment of the city) saw the Byzantines try to go on the offensive that saw them get utterly smashed at the battle of Sebastapolis in 692. This was then followed by 20 years of civil war that nearly led to the Empire disintegrating. The line only ended when Leo III repelled a far more serious Arab siege of Constantinople in 718, and then managed to win a crushing victory at Akrinion in 740, which ensured the Empire's survival in Europe and Anatolia.
</li><li> In addition to the details mentioned in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Elisabeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Elisabeth">Elisabeth</a></em> entry above, the musical left incidents out of Elisabeth and Rudolf's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a>:
<ul><li> Sisi was mourning the death of Count Richard S, a young man she had feelings for, when she met Emperor Franz Joseph.
</li><li> Trauma led Sisi to become paranoid. Doting on her youngest daughter Marie Valerie (referred to as Valerie), she was convinced that the family was divided in half, her and Valerie on one side, and everyone else on the other, who were all out to harm the mother and daughter, especially Rudolf. Valerie recounted in her private writings an incident before Rudolf's death, where she was surprised that her brother - unlike what her mother had always told her - treated her with civility, if not affection.
</li><li> With the exception of Gisela (who he got along with, and was away due to her marriage), everyone in his family treated Rudolf like a ticking time bomb. The militaristic and conservative Franz Joseph disapproved of Rudolf's perceived weakness and liberalism. For the Christmas before he died, Rudolf spent much of his time and effort to acquire some writings of the poet Heinrich Heine, who Sisi adored, as a present for his mother. According to historian Brigitte Hamann, the present was largely ignored. In that same party, the thirty-year-old Crown Prince caused an incident when he threw his arms around his mother and wept. He was suicidal well before that, but the people he confided in decided to spare the royal couple's feelings and kept it secret.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoyOrbison">Roy Orbison</a>'s life definitely counts. He grew up during the lowest point of the Depression, struggled and nearly despaired of making it as a singer due in part to his crippling stage fright, and married a young woman who cheated on him numerous times. They separated and later reconciled, only for her to be killed in a motorcycle accident soon after. Later, while he was on tour in England, he received word that his house had burned down with two of his three children inside. He was all but forgotten during the '70s and '80s. Then, just as he was on the threshold of a comeback in 1988, he died of heart failure at age 52.
</li><li> Edie Sedgwick, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyWarhol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyWarhol">Andy Warhol</a>'s muses. Had a history of mental illness and alcoholism in her family, an abusive father, a mother who let her take diet pills, one brother committed suicide, another died in motorbike crash, her father openly had affair and she claimed she walked in on him in bed with a woman, suffered from anorexia as a teen, parents isolated her and her siblings, allegedly exploited for her money and naivety, hospitalized due to mental illness and died at 28.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylviaPlath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylviaPlath">Sylvia Plath</a>'s life was mired in tragedy. She had daddy issues after her father died when she was eight years old, felt overwhelmingly pressured to do well in college because of her scholarships, and was torn apart on the inside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> nigh-mutually exclusive choice between career or family. She had a mental breakdown in the early '50s and failed numerous times to become a published writer (finally succeeding in the early '60s with <em>Ariel</em> and <em>The Bell Jar</em>). Then, in 1962, after her husband, Ted Hughes, who meant worlds to her, left her for another woman, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">she killed herself</a>.
</li><li> Several Hollywood stars have led notoriously rough lives, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaraBow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClaraBow">Clara Bow</a> takes the cake. Her parents never bothered with a birth certificate because they wanted her to die at birth. Her grandfather died of a heart attack while he was pushing Clara on a swing, when she was just four. Her best friend, a boy named Johnny, died in her arms when she was nine. Her father had a mental impairment, was rarely home, and when he was, he was physically and emotionally abusive. Her mother also had mental health problems, she thought Clara would be better off dead than an actress, and actually tried to kill her. When she was 15, her father raped her. Later, her studios maliciously went out of their way to humiliate her and degrade her, and she began to suffer breakdowns. Rumors about her sexual behavior were spread about viciously, including the false claim she had group sex with a whole football team. Eventually she retired from acting, married and had children - later she tried to kill herself, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
</li><li> John Reynolds, the actor who played Torgo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManosTheHandsOfFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ManosTheHandsOfFate">Manos: The Hands of Fate</a></em>. He had an abusive father, which led to him abusing a ton of drugs. By the time he did the film, this had severely affected his mental health, so that when he designed an apparatus that would make it look like his knees were backwards, he ended up wearing it the wrong way, causing him tremendous pain. He ended up killing himself shortly after <em>Manos</em> was finished, and when this was discovered in the wake of the film's use on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>, he mostly became the butt of jokes that he must have done it from the shame of being in such a horrible film. And if it wasn't that, they were mocking Torgo's bizarre line readings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed">which Reynolds himself wasn't responsible for</a>; the movie was filmed silent, and he didn't dub his own voice.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorisDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorisDay">Doris Day</a>. Her first husband, whom she married at 17, was a wife beater. She wanted to be a dancer, but a car accident put an end to that ambition. Her third husband, Martin Melcher, was described as "a skunk," signed her up to do a TV series without telling her (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">she only did the series because she needed the money</a>) and left her in debt when he died. She sued her husband's business partner and they fired lawsuits back and forth at each other for several years. Then she married for a fourth time, which ended in divorce. Her only child, Terry Melcher, died in 2004. She once said, "A baby, a husband who really loved me, a home, all the happiness they could bring. I never got that, and that's all I really wanted."
</li><li> Ireland had one during the age of the British rule. They were subjugated and treated as slaves under Elizabethan rule, victims of massacres and deportations during the English Civil War and under Cromwell's regime, and suffered one of the world's biggest famines in the 19th century. When the 20th century rolled around, things went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">From Bad to Worse</a> - after a long and bloody War of Independence and a Civil War, they realized that no one had a freaking clue how to run a country. The stranglehold of the Catholic Church increased, leading to massive abuse of power, including a ton of sexual abuse; homosexuality being declared illegal; and the horrific Magdalene Laundries where women could be locked away for having children out of wedlock. And Northern Ireland has suffered more terrorist attacks than any other place in the Western world.
</li><li> Before he became famous, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mika" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Mika">Mika</a> had this. He grew up in France with his mother and siblings. When he was still young his father, who was in the army, was held hostage in Beirut during the Gulf War. Though he and his family were safe in Paris, they ran out of money and were forced to escape to the UK. Then, at age nine, he was bullied relentlessly by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">sadist teacher</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsAreCruel">his classmates</a> until he had a mental breakdown which left him mute and unable to read for a while. He had to be homeschooled for six months before being sent to a different school.
