This is a popular way of avoiding a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">Spoiler Opening</a> for more plot-driven shows, usually mysteries, by having major characters who haven't been introduced or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">background characters with hidden importance</a> initially being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSilhouettes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterSilhouettes">silhouettes</a> or not appearing at all.
</p><p>In the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> or other shows being aired outside their home country, these changed credits may or may not carry over into foreign broadcasts, with overseas airings using only the first version of the credits or different ones entirely instead.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkumaNoRiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkumaNoRiddle">Akuma no Riddle</a></em> has a completely different ending for every episode, each corresponding to one of the students of class Black.
</li><li> The end credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AldnoahZero">Aldnoah.Zero</a></em> Season 2 end with a shot of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Princess Asseylum</span> lying comatose in a suspended animation tank. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she</span> wakes up in Episode 7, the shot is changed to show <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> waking up, followed by the now-empty stasis tank.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em>
<ul><li> The ending credits evolve with changes in the cast or relations among the characters, such as the removal of characters who move on, or a character who was revealed in that episode to be buff going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">shirtless</a> in the credits.
</li><li> The opening credits evolve as well. Like the ending credits, characters are added or subtracted from the opening as they are introduced to the cast, or they move on. Both the opening and ending of the final episode credits include ALL of the characters, even those who moved on very early in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>: With the opening theme.
<ul><li> Irina and Ritsu appear in the first OP after their introduction in Episodes 4 and 9, respectively.
</li><li> Episode 7 follows six students in a group during a field trip to Kyoto. The OP for that episode and the episode after that are sung by the voice actors of those six students instead of the ones who usually sing the theme tune.
</li><li> Episode 18 overhauls the second OP's sequence with new images and animations of the characters in their summer uniforms as well as dancing on the beach in casual summer wear, highlighting the start of the summer break portion of the series.
</li><li> Itona appears in the Season 2 opening from Episode 4 onwards, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after losing his tentacles and joining Terasaka's gang in the previous episode</span>.
</li><li> Following the God of Death arc, the opening of Season 2 Episode 9 shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Irina after her Good Costume Switch, and the God of Death's maskless face</span>.
</li><li> The second OP of Season 2 (Episode 15 onwards) changes to show how many days the class has left to kill Koro-sensei.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Opening song in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, The Emblem of Wall Maria is shown with bright, clear colors. By Episode 4, the emblem is now shown with duller and darker colors. This seems to be an error, however, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedOnDVD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedOnDVD">Blu-ray releases</a> of every episode include the later version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuon">Bakuon!!</a></em>, similarly to the <em>K-On</em> example below, strategically inserts Chisame into the opening sequence following her introduction midway through the season.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BestStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BestStudentCouncil">Best Student Council</a></em> uses the "simple" revealing-silhouettes version.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration">Opening Narration</a> talk about how the first Wizard King became a legend for defeating a demon and saving the kingdom. After his name is revealed and the fight is shown in detail, the narration changes to mention his name and show more in-depth visuals of the battle. After the Reincarnation Arc, which resolves the story of the first Wizard King, the narration changes to talk about Asta and his desire to become the Wizard King.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> ending theme <em>Haruka Kanata</em> gives the spotlight to a different character every episode.
<ul><li> The same thing was done before with <em>Houkiboshi</em>, which gives the spotlight to one of the captains and their lieutenant (and sometimes, other members of that Gotei 13) each episode that ending theme was used.
</li><li> While not exactly credits, the opening of the <em>Fullbring</em> arc of the anime changed as Ichigo's Fullbring evolved.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal">BNA: Brand New Animal</a></em>: The closing credits of the first five episodes show Michiru's best friend Nazuna in human form. At the sixth episode where she's revealed to have transformed into a fox beastman, the end sequence depicts her with her baeast form for the rest of the series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BodaciousSpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BodaciousSpacePirates">Bodacious Space Pirates</a></em>
<ul><li> Its opening does this a couple times as new characters are introduced. One interesting example is that after Episode 18, Jenny is now shown in the wedding dress she wore in the prior two episdes as well as in a different pose and position.
</li><li> Another example is with one of the commercial bumpers which shows the Space Yacht Club, where after Jenny graduates, the image no longer depicts her in it and the new members of the club are added.
</li><li> The end credits originally showed only Marika, Chiaki, and Mami. Starting from Episode 13 onward, the sequence adds Gruier and Grunhilde to the group.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Btooom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Btooom">Btooom!</a></em> Once the heroine starts opening up to Sakamoto they start holding hands in the OP.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em> had Shaoran appear briefly in the opening credits only after he was introduced; the American version (even the subtitled version) used one set of credits for almost everything, missing this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ChivalryOfAFailedKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ChivalryOfAFailedKnight">Chivalry of a Failed Knight</a></em>, one shot in the opening sequence changes to foreshadow Ikki's next big fight every four episodes. Additionally, after Ikki and Stella <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">become a couple</span> in episode 4, a shot that originally has the two slide past each other reverses to have them come to face each other instead.
</li><li> The ending credits for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad">Clannad After Story</a></em> anime features most of the cast walking in line one after the other. When Tomoya's grandmother is introduced in episode 18, she shows up in the ending. One episode later, and his father gets added as well, in the space behind Akio and Sanae. In the final episode, Fuuko and Ushio lead the line.
<ul><li> The episode title card also changes, showing the orbs of light collecting, and eventually the girl from the illusory world.
</li></ul></li><li> The first two openings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>'s first season added images of new characters and mecha after a few episodes (like a silhouetted shot of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cyborg!Jeremiah</span> in the latter half of the episodes using <em>Kaidoku Funou</em>). However, neither of R2's openings did the same thing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrossGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrossGame">Cross Game</a></em> does this very subtly. The heroine is from a family of four sisters who together are (in show) symbolized by a four leaf clover, which appears in the show's title logo. (See the image on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrossGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CrossGame">Cross Game</a></em> page.) After the first episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> one of the leaves is faded, as the corresponding sister dies in the first episode.</span> In the series finale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the leaf returns to full color once again, symbolizing that the cast have finally come to terms with Wakaba's death.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl">Daily Life with Monster Girl</a></em>, the final episode adds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lala</span> to the final shot of the harem cuddling Kimihito in bed. Kimihito's expression also changes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankWhiteEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlankWhiteEyes">stunned</a> to serene, showing how he's gotten used to having the girls around. Comparing <a class="urllink" href="https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/t31.0-8/11411864_742908825819878_3836256320234607127_o.jpg">the original shot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> to <a class="urllink" href="https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t31.0-8/12034319_777986592312101_4923162294570650061_o.jpg">the one in the final episode<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> also reveals a conspicuous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a>, just like the rest of the episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganronpaTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganronpaTheAnimation">Danganronpa: The Animation</a></em>:
<ul><li> The ending pans out from a picture featuring Makoto Naegi and everyone who has died up to that point. Episode 10 onwards changes the picture to include all 15 students.
</li><li> After the introduction of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Genocider Sho</span>, the opening slightly changes to show them as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Both sides of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DanganRonpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em> do this. In <em>Side: Future</em>, the opening slightly changes between episodes 1 and 2, adding colours to characters' potential deaths. It also includes the counter showing how many people are still alive. In <em>Side: Despair</em>, episode 1 opening only shows Nanami as a silhouette, only fully showing her starting from episode 2.
<ul><li> The <em>Side:Despair</em> opening changes again starting episode 6. The biggest change is that the formerly light and pastel color palette is much darker, resulting in everyone (sans Chiaki Nanami) having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">red eyes</a>. There are several other changes, starting with the question mark being removed from the English phrase "Hello, Hope's Peak High School?." The part showing Kamukura and Hinata has Hinata being only a flickering image within the silhouette of Kamukura's hair, reflecting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his personality having been surgically erased in order for him to become Kamukura.</span> Finally, Nanami is seen smiling when she turns around, as opposed to the neutral expression she had in the previous version. There's also the grown-up version of Saionji.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFranxx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarlingInTheFranxx">DARLING in the FRANXX</a></em>:
<ul><li> Futoshi and Mitsuru swap their positions in the opening sequence from Episode 12 to Episode 14 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to reflect them swapping their partners in the previous episode</span>.
</li><li> While a new animated sequence is used for the OP from Episode 16 onwards, "KISS OF DEATH" is still used as the OP song. Much like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>, though, this opening sequence uses the second verse and chorus instead of the first verse and chorus.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>
<ul><li> In the first opening, Watari is in silhouette and trenchcoat until the series shows his true appearance. Although, curiously, L's much more mysterious and intriguing appearance DOESN'T get this treatment.
</li><li> They also subvert the trope with Naomi Misora, showing her well before her introduction <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and for quite some time after her death</span>.
</li><li> Of course when it came time to adapt the second arc, the same second spoilerish opening was used <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even long after L and Watari's deaths</span> and wasn't updated to give more focus to the "new" characters, perhaps foretelling the less focus that the second arc would get in the anime.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em> features the nine members of the Hashira. For the first couple of episodes, only Giyu Tomioka is visible (since he appears in the first episode) while the other 8 members are shrouded in shadow. Once each of them make their first full appearances in future episodes, the opening updates by making them fully visible alongside Tomioka.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilSurvivor2">Devil Survivor 2: The Animation</a></em>, dead characters are removed from the ending credits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> feature these by unshadowing the higher level Digimon (and in the case of the latter two, unshadowing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Rangers</a>) as the series progressed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonXrosWars">Digimon Xros Wars</a></em> did a variant in its second opening - initially in the sequence where Shoutmon and Greymon warp through all their Xrossed forms the sequence stops at the point where Shoutmon X5 and DeckerGreymon form and switches to stock evolution footage to illustrate OmegaShoutmon and ZekeGreymon, padding it out slightly. When Shoutmon DX and Shoutmon X7 showed up, the stock footage was removed and the full "warp" sequence was played adding in Shoutmon DX and Shoutmon X7.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em> was altered slightly partway through, switching and editing a couple of scenes to reflect the change in antagonists, Ken's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and the newfound availability of natural evolution. This was the only time the opening was changed, so it <em>still</em> managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">spoil the existence of both of Imperialdramon's forms</a>...
</li><li> A rare example of a translation doing this: the English dub of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> added Kari and the higher level digivolutions to the opening partway through the series.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em> swaps out old footage for new action scenes whenever each new baddie shows up in the story. At first it focuses primarily on Vegeta and Frieza's men, then exclusively on Goku's fight with Frieza, and then changes to include the entire group fighting the Androids.
<ul><li> This is far from the first time <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> has used this trope. The original opening, <em>Mystical Adventure,</em> changes around the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightOfCerebus">Piccolo Daimao</a>, while the ending changes footage four times (the American release only uses one version for each throughout). Z's first theme, <em>Cha-La Head Cha-La</em> changes around the arrival of Vegeta and Nappa, and again at the beginning of the Artificial Humans arc.
</li><li> Following in tradition, the intro to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> involved two shots of Goku turning into the Super Saiyan God form (once as Shenron appeared in the background, once at the end.) At the start of the Golden Frieza arc, this changed to him attaining the blue Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan form. Shots of Frieza and his henchmen were also added in.
<ul><li> Continues with shots of the Universe 6 Team during the Universe 6 Arc and Trunks, Mai, Black and Zamasu during the Black Arc. The entire opening changes for the Universe Survival Arc. Even the Universe Survival Arc didn't come out unscathed as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Majin Buu is replaced with Frieza</span> in both the opening and in the version of the credits playing "Boogie Back".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/EfaFairyTaleOfTheTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/EfaFairyTaleOfTheTwo">ef: A Tale of Memories</a></em> eventually displays the pairings in the credits once the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">love intrigue was solved</a>. While only shown in silhouette form you can see that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Hiro ends up with Miyako and that Chihiro breaks from her chain which is a symbol for her having overcome, to some extent, the issues with her memory loss condition</span>.
<ul><li> The trend continues with its sequel, A Tale of Melodies. In the final episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuu breaks free from his crucifixion and Yuuko appears with angel wings.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ERASED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ERASED">ERASED</a></em>'s opening changes significantly in Episode 11; most noticeably, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Satoru is completely removed from the intro, leaving several shots that just show empty windows or walls, reflecting his apparent death at the end of the previous episode (actually a fifteen-year coma)</span>. The black bars over the eyes of various characters are removed, and a spider's thread appears above Kayo's head to reflect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yashiro's opening narration, in which he describes seeing such threads hanging over the heads of his victims</span>. The final episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">adds Satoru back in again</span> but keeps the other changes.
</li><li> The first opening and ending sequences in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSevenAo">Eureka Seven Ao</a></em> change the color of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedIntoStrangeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedIntoStrangeness">Ao's hair</a> and the Nirvash in sync with their actual color changes in the series. As the series progresses the opening also adds an additional shot of Eureka - first with her back to the camera, then turning to face it.
</li><li> The credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GAGeijutsukaArtDesignClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GAGeijutsukaArtDesignClass">GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class</a></em> not only cycles between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearrangeTheSong">5 versions of the ending song</a>, but also has steadily changed over the course of the series with the girls getting older and their activities changing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em>
<ul><li> The original TV series changes its credits every time a new robot gets added to the heroes' lineup.
</li><li> <em>GaoGaiGar FINAL</em> changes its opening for <em>every single episode</em> to account for the changes in the storyline. The main reason they could do this was because <em>FINAL</em> is an eight-episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OAV">OAV</a>, and would thus have the size and budget to do such a thing.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>, the ending rotates through different girls and the tanks they operate. And in episode 5.5, it shows four of them side by side.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>, the last part of episode 13 replaces Gran with Djeeta, a woman who takes his place during said episode. Oddly enough, he still appears in the first half of the ending as well as the opening.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>
<ul><li> The second opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Gundam SEED</a></em> features the Freedom Gundam with its wings deployed in silhouette, many episodes before its debut. The third opening, which started playing at least a dozen of episodes before the Freedom's actual debut, has it launching from the Archangel's linear catapult and in a few action scenes with the Justice Gundam, which also did not get its debut until an episode or two after the Freedom's. Subsequently, in <em>Destiny</em>'s first opening, the same scene shown in <em>SEED</em>s second opening is shown again, this time without the shadowing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeedDestiny">Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>'s second opening features shots of three future Gundams (Destiny, Strike Freedom, and Destroy) fighting one another in silhouette; by the time the third opening comes, all three have been revealed in-series, and thus the sequence returns <em>sans</em> shadowing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">After War Gundam X</a></em> has a silhouette of the Gundam Double X showing up as it starts to influence the plot; the OP changes completely after it becomes Garrod's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a>. And then, it changes again one more time when the Leopard Destroy and G-Falcon make their debuts.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ</a></em> has its first opening altered early on, dumping all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheCameraRunning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveTheCameraRunning">Leave the Camera Running</a> segments in favor of ZZ Gundam in action and replacing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Mashymre Cello</a> with Roux Louka in the cast group shot once they both appear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em> does this for its entire first season- the Barbatos's armor changes in time with its upgrades in the show, going from an emaciated, barely armored wreck to a mishmash of parts and finally to its fully armored completed form. Characters also enter (Naze and his girls, the different mobile suits the kids collect as they go) and leave <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (Fumitan most notably)</span> in accordance with their introductions and exits. The gimmick is unfortunately absent from season 2.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GunXSword">GUN×SWORD</a></em> silhouettes everyone who hasn't yet shown up in a sort of violet-blue aether, and everyone and everything who has been killed or destroyed in solid black shadow. The end credits do something similar, showing various "casual" pictures of major characters. In the beginning, they're all of Van and Wendy; as the cast expands, pictures of the newcomers replace various shots in the montage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Barakamon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Barakamon">Handa-kun's</a></em> ending adds characters to the lineup as they're introduced in-episode. Additionally, Episode 8 shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Ichimiya and his gang</a>, and in the final episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the previously-transparent supporting characters are fully-colored and stay until the end, reflecting how they've finally connected with Handa.</span>
</li><li> The first line of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiniroMosaic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KiniroMosaic">Hello!! Kiniro Mosaic</a></em>'s intro changes from episode to episode, with either one girl singing it, or the main five girls singing it.
</li><li> Halfway through the series, the opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a> Kai</em> added two scenes with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hanyuu</span> and slightly modified another to reflect a very important event that had just occurred. A variation from the same intro was a playback to the gory, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Poor Communication Kills</a> time (Rena's machete) being replaced with a scene where the connection was fixed. It's a variation since it was due to <em>censorship</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimoutoUmaruChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HimoutoUmaruChan">Himouto! Umaru-chan</a></em>'s outro depicts the four main girls frolicking at the beach. They spend most of the final episode doing exactly that, and the episode ends with Taihei suggesting that they visit the mountains next time. The final episode's credits sequence duly depicts the four main girls frolicking in the mountains instead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IdolmasterXenoglossia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IdolmasterXenoglossia">Idolmaster: Xenoglossia</a></em>'s second opening, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yukiho Hagiwara is revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a></span>, the shot of her towards the end of the opening is changed from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her wearing her school uniform to wearing the outfit she has after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InazumaEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InazumaEleven">Inazuma Eleven</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first anime opening goes through some changes starting with episode 19, mostly to ilustrate Kidou's transition from a member of Teikoku and Kageyama's underling (being replaced by Zeus' captain Aphrodi in this regard) to a member of Raimon. Domon and Ichinose are also added in the opening for the first time, although the former joined the protagonist's team much earlier.
</li><li> <em>Orion no Kokuin</em> has a habit of changing its opening and ending themes every time a new member joins Inazuma Japan.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos">Infinite Stratos</a></em> (pictured), the ending credits change as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">more girls are introduced</a>; the most significant change is that since the ending theme is sung by these girls' voice actors, the song progressively gets more and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingMusic">more complex as the verses get distributed between more voices</a>. It also hints at how close the girls are to Ichika, the main male protagonist, and the closer the girl is to him in that episode, the closer they're running behind him during the ending credits. <br/><br/>In hindsight, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the ending credits have a stealth spoiler in the form of Charl who appears in the credits right after her introduction... even though it takes a few more episodes to reveal her real gender (and when that happens, her appearance in the credits changes accordingly). The spoiler comes from the fact that aside from Ichika, everyone else who appears in the credits is a girl.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Inukami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Inukami">Inukami!</a></em> has its endings show where the cast is currently living.
</li><li> The cards displayed in the endings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsTheOrderARabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IsTheOrderARabbit">Is the Order a Rabbit?</a></em> anime vary slightly, and adds more girls as they're introduced in the show.
<ul><li> In episodes 8 and 9, it switches from blue to red cards about halfway through, and displays multiple cards at once instead of one at a time. Additionally, at the end of 8, instead of Chino's father and Tippy at the end, it's Aoyama and Tippy. He doesn't say anything, and instead just turns around and notices it's not his son.
</li><li> In episode 10, it reverts back to the original ending, though it doesn't always shows face cards initially. A couple of cards then drop on top of it until one of the correct cards is seen, then the rotation begins again, until a set of Royal Straight Flush with two Jokers (containing all girls) is completed. Chino also pops up at the next episode preview when Tippy mentions wanting a quiet Christmas to announce they were throwing a Christmas party next episode.
</li><li> During episode 11's ending, the red and blue cards are shown simultaneously, along with the face of the cards on a third deck. After a short while only one card is seen, and it rotates between the face cards with the various girls on them. Additionally the background is Christmas-themed and switches images occasionally.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>
<ul><li> The end credits for the 2012 anime, which features a slow-pan over an Aztec mural filling with blood (Part 2 continues where Part 1's credits left off,) while shots of the characters appear in the foreground, with new ones appearing when new characters are introduced and old ones disappearing or updating when characters die, fade from relevancy in the current events or undergo a drastic change (like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">normal Dio becoming vampire Dio, or Stroheim becoming a cyborg.</span>)
</li><li> Also in play for the opening of Diamond is Unbreakable. For the first few episodes, Josuke and Okuyasu pose with their respective Stands while Koichi poses alone. Once Echoes is revealed, it appears alongside Koichi, and appears later in the opening alongside Okuyasu's The Hand.
<ul><li> Following their introduction, Reimi and Arnold appears in the second Diamond Is Unbreakable opening during the group photograph behind Jotaro.
</li><li> The end credits for Diamond Is Unbreakable updates itself with the introduction of new characters.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens again in Golden Wind's third ending credits sequence, which depicts every Stand seen thus far in the series. Stands belonging to bad guys are shown first and at the bottom, then a gap in the middle, then those of the heroes with the antagonist's Stand mingled among them. As new Stands are revealed, they are placed in that gap.
</li><li> Starting with <em>Stardust Crusaders</em>, each Part has an "endgame" version of the opening that shows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> influencing the credits (including the theme song itself) with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMaster">Time Master</a> powers.
<ul><li> <em>Stardust Crusaders</em>: The original version of "JOJO ~ Sono Chi no Kiyoku" showed Star Platinum punching a mirror followed by DIO appearing behind Jotaro. In the final version of the opening, DIO freezes time after Jotaro breaks the mirror and slowly walks behind him, with no sound except the echoes of his footsteps.
</li><li> <em>Diamond is Unbreakable</em>: During the final arc, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kira Yoshikage gains the power to create time loops, a portion of "Great Days" is shown in reverse before continuing as normal.</span>
</li><li> <em>Golden Wind</em>: Originally a portion of "Traitors' Requiem" showed drops of blood falling onto the ground in time lapse due to King Crimson's power. The endgame version shows this sequence from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diavolo's</span> perspective as he monologues in Italian at a time-skipped Giorno. Also, the opening initially shows Doppio going through a mind battle as he realizes something. Once it's revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doppio <em>is</em> Diavolo with another personality</span>, the opening changes appropriately to show <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doppio transforming into Diavolo</span>.
</li><li> From the penultimate episode onward, the opening changes once again. This time, once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diavolo</span> activates King Crimson to skip time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the effect of King Crimson is reverted to zero by the effect of Giorno's Gold Experience Requiem.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The ending for season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> initially keeps Miko's face hidden during her close-up, but she turns to face Kaguya like everyone else following her formal introduction in episode 4.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Karin">Karin</a></em>'s opening avoids this by having a character who hasn't been introduced yet be seen only in a silhouette until after their first full episode as part of the cast, although their rather unique form makes it hard <em>not</em> to guess who it is when they first appear...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> switched up its first opening early on in its run, replacing the goofy antics of baby Lambo and I-Pin with action shots of Tsuna fighting against the Kokuyo trio — a sign that things were going to get more serious.
</li><li> Strangely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a> in the opening credits for the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kekkaishi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kekkaishi">Kekkaishi</a></em>. The credits change to add shots of either enemies or allies relevant to whatever arc the episodes take place in, but always showcased Shishio Gen far before he even made an appearance and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even after he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KemonoFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KemonoFriends">Kemono Friends</a></em>' opening fills in silhouettes of the characters as they appear.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em>'s second opening changed to show the characters' various wardrobe changes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>, upon the addition of Azusa to the Light Music Club, she is super-imposed into several scenes, as well as her very own character introduction, in the OP. Yet strangely, the keyword here is 'several', since she doesn't appear together with the other 4 club members in <em>all</em> the scenes where all the other 4 club members are present. Also, the opening theme song is modified slightly, with additional guitar bits and one more backing vocal mixed in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LaidBackCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LaidBackCamp">Laid-Back Camp</a></em>: Rin's gradual warming up to Nadeshiko can be seen in the opening credits through her messages with Nadeshiko. From episodes one to seven, Rin's reply is "No". Episode eight to eleven has her respond "I'll consider it", and in the finale, she answers, "sure".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters">Little Busters!</a></em>: Near the beginning of the first set of credits, there's a shot of each of the childhood friends standing together. In episode 15, after the last main character finally joins the Little Busters for real, the shot is changed to one of all of the characters standing together. Also, while the original credits were pretty upbeat, the new credits add in some darker shots of Kud and Haruka looking sad, reflecting the way the story starts off seeming bright and happy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">and then slowly goes downhill.</a>
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's</a></em> ends with shots of the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Devices</a> used in the season. When the last episode rolls around, we see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">Durandal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCoolCrosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCoolCrosses">Schwertkreuz</a> take the places of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">S2U</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Book of Darkness</a> in the opening due to the events of the previous episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MagicalGirlRaisingProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MagicalGirlRaisingProject">Magical Girl Raising Project</a></em>: Swim Swim's silhouette is initially pure black instead for her eyes in the opening for the first episode of the anime, gradually revealing her features and attire more clearly as the series goes on.
</li><li> In the penultimate episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicOfStella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicOfStella">Magic of Stella</a></em>, the characters' RPG-style stat screens in the intro change to show them "levelling up". Comically, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Yumine</a>'s stat levels changes to an incomprehensibly long hexadecimcal value.
</li><li> The anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> does this with the opening. Apart from the song change every 5 episodes or so, the girl's bathing suits occasionally change colours. <em>Negima!?</em> plays the trope straight in the ending. The further the show goes, the more characters appear at the bottom-right and play music instruments. When Setsuna joins in, she sleeps in halfway into the song, only to wake near the end and become red like a hummer out of shame.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Moldiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Moldiver">Moldiver</a></em> replaces the central figure in its credits once it becomes clear in the story who the <em>real</em> hero is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em> uses what seems to be illustrations from a children's picture book for the first ending theme. These gradually change over the course of the series. The series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSong">remix album</a> contains what appears to be a reading of the actual story.
</li><li> The first ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid">My Bride is a Mermaid</a></em> consists of a still shot of the characters in a karaoke booth that gradually zooms out. It starts out with only a few characters but gets increasingly crowded as more and more characters are introduced in the series and subsequently added to the mayhem. The ending was also reused for the series' final episode, and added in everyone who had been introduced since the original ending theme had last been used.
</li><li> The first two endings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> have a small change after a few episodes each. Both times, the change involves school uniforms: in the first ending Izuku changes from his middle school uniform to the Yuuei one, while in the second one everyone starts wearing summer uniforms (no jacket and short-sleeved shirt)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> is particularly fond of this in its many openings.
<ul><li> The fourth opening changed midway through to include characters from the Search for Tsunade arc- for example, the wall painting also includes Anko (who'd debuted in the Chunin Exam arcs), Shizune and Tsunade, while the action shots include the jonin instructors fighting Itachi and Kisame, as well as Naruto fighting Kabuto. The first version ends with Naruto throwing a punch, while the second version shows him using the Rasengan.
</li><li> The fifth opening changes midway through, swapping out the dead Jirobo and Kidomaru for Kimimaro, showing the Sand Siblings among the main characters' allies, and instead of showing Lee and Guy crying together, shows them training, since Lee's surgery was successful.
</li><li> The first opening for <em>Shippuden</em> changed after the reintroductions of Team Guy and the Sand Shinobi, as well as the introduction of Chiyo. The fourth opening recycled scenes from the third for a while until that season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was ready to make her entrance.
</li><li> Technically, the scenes from when Asuma, Shikamaru, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Izumo and Kotetsu</a> fight Hidan and Kakuzu in the third opening were most likely supposed to be originally part of the fourth opening, given that they flow better with the fourth song and the animation, and were included to show that the show had moved past the filler arc.
</li><li> The fourth opening also changes midway through, replacing the aforementioned fights with Hidan and Kakuzu with fights against the villains of the Three-Tails arc.
</li><li> Later, the second version of the fifth <em>Shippuden</em> opening transitions from Orochimaru staring at Sasuke as the curse mark spreads at him to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasuke killing Orochimaru after he does</span>, and now features the members of Team Snake.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Toonami">Toonami</a>'s openings did not follow this format and always kept the first step of the Evolving Credits as the opening for that season.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Needless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Needless">NEEDLESS</a></em> has a small one in the second intro — a shot of Simeon's fourth strongest removing their mask cuts away before you get to see the face until the big reveal happens a few episodes later.
</li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Nisekoi">Nisekoi</a></em>, Tsugumi and Marika are only shown in silhouette (though their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureHeadgear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureHeadgear">hair decorations</a> are detailed) in the opening until their introduction. The pan of the main cast across a starry field also adds more characters as they're introduced.
</li><li> In each of its four seasons, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OjamajoDoremi">Ojamajo Doremi</a></em> updated its opening (and changed its eyecatches) midway through the season to reflect changes from about that point in the storyline.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OkusamaGaSeitokaichou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OkusamaGaSeitokaichou">Okusama Ga Seitokaichou</a></em> did this with the opening <em>and</em> closing credits. The opening featured a short message that was shown in a different language each time, as well as two brief montage sequences, one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviouslyOn">briefly recapping the previous episode</a> and one showing a glimpse of what's to come in this episode. The end credits depicted Ui <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreditsRunningSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreditsRunningSequence">running through a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeClosingCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeClosingCredits">generic platform game level</a>, with each episode's sequence roughly following on from the previous one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">So Bad, It's Good</a> 4Kids opening updated the song every time a new character was introduced in the crew. By the time Chopper was in, there was almost no space in the song for another character (as the last verse said "Sanji is cooking, Chopper is doctoring"). For the very few 4Kids episodes that had Robin in the crew, all they did was add a shot of Robin into it and reverted the song back to version one.
</li><li> Oddly, most of the openings from the original Japanese version have never done this, even when they got horribly out of date. The second intro, for example, continued featuring only five members in the crew for dozens of episodes after they had added two more (Vivi and Chopper.) What's odd is that an evolved version of the second opening featuring the two of them (along with characters from the Alabasta storyline) <em>does</em> exist, but it never aired on television: it was only used as the intro to a PlayStation game.
</li><li> And then they went ahead and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted this trope</a> with the third intro, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">spoils the fact that </a><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">Vivi leaves the crew and Robin joins them</a></span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">a good 10 or so episodes before this happens</a>. Somewhat justified in that most Japanese fans already knew this was coming from reading the manga, though.
</li><li> <em>One Piece</em> finally acted on this trope with the thirteenth opening, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sH4N3t2mP4">One Day<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Blackbeard's new crewmembers were revealed</span>, they are all briefly shown alongside him.
</li><li> The 19th opening also makes use of this trope, obscuring <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edward Weevil</span> from the Seven Warlords of the Sea shot before his proper introduction in an episode. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Raizou the ninja</span>'s first episode, he starts appearing in the Wano warriors shot as well.
<ul><li> Also, Zunisha (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the elephant that carries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurtleIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurtleIsland">Zou</a></span>) gradually becomes more visible.
</li></ul></li><li> Opening 20 has a sequence where Sanji wears a long red cape that flows in the wind. After three episodes, it is changed so that the cape becomes a frame for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">brief scenes of Sanji and Luffy's fight.</span> This opening also shadows the portraits of the ministers Katakuri, Smoothie, Compote, Daifuku and Oven until their debut on the show.
</li><li> Opening 21 also did this, shadowing characters with major moments <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">namely Carrot's Su Long transformation, Katakuri's mouth, Luffy's Snakeman form, and Big Mom looking slim</span> until they appeared in the show proper.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> has a subtle change starting with episode 18: The shot of the three female leads on a bed, instead of having them all facing different directions, shows Aisha and Suzuka holding Melfina, who's looking at the camera and smiling.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinMusume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PenguinMusume">Penguin Musume</a></em>, a web anime, deserves a mention for having its opening evolve <em>weekly</em>. What started off as simple Flash animation eventually evolved into an opening with actual animation and some pretty nifty battle sequences.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona4TheAnimation">Persona 4: The Animation</a></em> has one of its credits animations, starting from the second episode. The credits sequence involves several Persona cards that are glowing white on one side. As the show progresses, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarotMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TarotMotifs">Tarot</a> symbols start appearing instead of the blank space.
</li><li> Zig-zagged by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona5TheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Persona5TheAnimation">Persona 5: The Animation</a></em>. The first opening shows the first six Phantom Thieves right off the bat, including Makoto, who doesn't awaken her Persona until just before the switch to the second intro. The second opening doesn't include Futaba and Haru until after their awakenings, but Haru does get added to the closing sequence an episode early, since she's already technically a Phantom Thief at that point.
</li><li> ED example: Gainax anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PetitePrincessYucie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PetitePrincessYucie">Petite Princess Yucie</a></em> changes scenes of the ending sequence to showcase the full cast of all the candidate girls finally revealed, also changing the lyrics a bit. It reverted back to the original sequence with Yucie solo in a very particular episode foreshadowing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yucie's memories becoming lost in the final episode as the girls wish to cease existence, leaving her alone, for her sake. Of course, they all get better in the end thanks to the magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparklingStreamOfTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SparklingStreamOfTears">Sparkling Stream of Tears</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Planetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Planetes">Planetes</a></em> uses this trope extensively, always according to the mood and current plotline. For instance, showing different secondary cast members (or, in one case, in different clothes to show their changing allegiances,) showing an explosion on the moon, a floating compass, or progressively adding color to a sequence that starts out in black and white. Most tellingly, Hachimaki's encounter with his somber "Astronaut" persona during the Opening Sequence becomes increasingly important and denotes his current state of mind.
</li><li> Isla's expression at the very end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PlasticMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PlasticMemories">Plastic Memories</a></em>' intro sequence changes from episode to episode to reflect the current state of her relationship with Tsukasa. It's subtle at first, but becomes more noticeable later on, and leads to a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> in the last episode where she smiles at Tsukasa while starting to cry, in acknowledgement of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her impending shutdown</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most late openings and endings of have had updates to reflect any changes to a main character's current team, making this a case of <em>literally</em> evolving credits.
</li><li> Additionally, high-ranking opponents in later seasons, such as Gym Leaders and the Elite Four, are shown in silhouette until Ash manages to meet and overcome them.
</li><li> The best example of this was the fourth Advanced Generation opening, Battle Frontier. Each of the Frontier Brains were shadowed in the opening, becoming unshadowed when Ash meets them. This also carried over into the next opening, Spurt!, where the remaining Brains were unshadowed upon appearing. A small gallery of the times the Battle Frontier opening updated its animation can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Frontier_(song)">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The "Battle Frontier" opening also updated its animation not to reflect on the current team, but serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dualvertisement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dualvertisement">Dualvertisement</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonRescueTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonMysteryDungeonRescueTeam">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team</a></em>, as there is one shot that mimic that game's cover art. This is notable becase the anime rarely promotes spin-offs, if at all.
</li><li> <em>Best Wishes</em> tops all of them; it features Pikachu running around a black and white field past many Pokemon in silhouette; after those Pokemon are seen in the show, the Pokemon are revealed in the opening.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Pretear">Prétear</a></em>'s symbolic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeThemeSong">Anime Theme Song</a>'s standards are met in the final few episodes where the opening was touched up a bit, adding sound effects, and replacing one scene at a very specific part during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune">Theme Tune</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> revealing Mikage to become the Princess of Disaster and her ultimate connection with Himeno, as the former Pretear herself</span>.
</li><li> Very common in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> franchise:
<ul><li> The second half of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em> had the ending changed to feature the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> instead of the old one and to include Pollun along with Mipple and Mepple.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YesPrettyCure5">Yes!

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">HeartCatch Pretty Cure!</a></em> had three openings, the second adding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cure Sunshine</span> and the third added <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not just Cure Moonlight, but Coupe in the battle scene as well</span>.

The halfway point has the most noticeable overhaul, with the addition of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cure Scarlet</span> and the switch to the song's second verse.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MahoGirlsPrecure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MahoGirlsPrecure">Maho Girls PreCure</a></em> adds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cure Felice</span> and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">again</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingMusic">remixes the theme</a>.

In addition, as virtually all of the villains except Listol have undergone a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> by the halfway point, they are replaced by another group of villains.
</li></ul></li><li> Being by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioSHAFT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioSHAFT">Studio SHAFT</a>, it shouldn't be much of a surprise that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em> does this. Mostly pretty small changes, though. The only one the average viewer is likely to catch is Kyouko and Homura finally being added to the group shot in episode 10.
</li><li> The first version of the opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleAndDragons">Puzzle and Dragons X</a></em> has Ace and Lance doing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerWalk">Power Walk</a>. The second version includes Sonia, Garnet, and Charo. By Episode 10, Tiger is included.
<ul><li> The new version of the second opening in Episode 33 implies a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> tone.
</li></ul></li><li> In the opening sequence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RahXephon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RahXephon">RahXephon</a></em>, the title mecha was shown as a silhouette with glowing eyes until a few episodes in. It changes again around halfway through the series to reflect the results of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">Mid-Season Upgrade</a> and a few other plot developments.
</li><li> Played with for the posters of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> series, with each poster appearing almost exactly the same, except with each new poster, new characters are added. For example, the poster for <em>Evangelion 1.0</em> features Shinji, Rei, Toji, Kensuke, Hikari, and Kaworu. The poster for <em>Evangelion 2.0</em> features everyone from the first poster, plus Asuka and Mari.
</li><li> The opening of <em>RO-KYU-BU! SS</em> changes the numbers of the fifth graders twice, reflecting how they are standing in the season. For example, Mimi starts out with the number 33, but when the Fifth-Grader Team is complete, the opening changes her number to 4 and then later to 10 after the fifth graders and sixth graders unite together.
</li><li> The anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RunWithTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RunWithTheWind">Run with the Wind</a></em> changes some of the visuals of its second ending after Episode 17. Initially, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome">Deliberately Monochrome</a> shots of the Kansei University track team members looking pensive and troubled. From Episode 18 onwards, this is replaced by shots of the characters all facing the sun with confident looks on their faces, and it's all in full color. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is the episode where the team begins their long-awaited Hakone Ekiden race.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>
<ul><li> A classic example is the original anime, where the early opening only showed three Senshi (before the other two were introduced). The original Japanese edition even had two subtypes of that first opening: before Sailor Mercury was introduced, it had minor differences like the color of the inside of Tuxedo's cape and the three Senshi not removing the veils. From episode 27 onwards a completely different opening was used, now including all five girls, as well as a completely different ending, complete with a new theme.
</li><li> <em>Sailor Moon R</em> did the complete opening replacement as well, introducing Chibiusa and the Black Moon Clan halfway through. (Interestingly, the two openings do <em>not</em> correspond to the two story arcs of the season in terms of timing, the switch occurs way after Chibiusa's initial appearance.)
</li><li> <em>Sailor Moon S</em>, <em>SuperS</em> and <em>Stars</em> do a less radical version of this trope, only altering part of the same opening sequence to introduce new characters. <em>S</em> pulled off <em>three</em> versions of the credits, first introducing Uranus and Neptune after they stopped hiding, and later adding Chibimoon, Hotaru and Super Sailor Moon. <em>SuperS</em> replaced the Amazon Trio with the Amazones' Quartet once the latter group took over the task. <em>Stars</em> showed Sailor Starlights as silhouettes until the end of the first arc, which focused on wrapping up the plot of <em>SuperS</em>; along with Starlights, the second version of the opening introduces <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Galaxia</a>.
</li><li> Sadly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Geneon">Geneon</a> uncut DVD release of <em>S</em> and <em>SuperS</em> ignores this and uses the final versions of the opening sequences from the start, spoiling future characters' appearances. <em>Stars</em> was spared due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">never getting an official release</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal">Sailor Moon Crystal</a></em>'s intro changed slightly starting with Episode 15, to reflect the new Black Moon arc. The Dark Kingdom members were replaced with the Black Moon members, and a shot of Queen Serenity in the Moon Castle was replaced with shots of Chibi-Usa and Sailor Pluto.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening animation for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlyNamedSequel2ElectricBoogaloo">(Zoku)</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em> starts off as projected black-and-white film and gradually gets darker and lower-quality. Floating kanji and a border are also added to the falling sequence. Near the end of the series, the opening gains color during the falling sequence, but the film tears on the projector before getting any farther. The last episode finally has the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44r0jCd6PE4">entire opening<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in full, gaudy Technicolor with added animation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SchoolLive">School-Live!</a></em> changes twice. Episode 8 makes it less of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchCredits">Bait-and-Switch Credits</a> by adding zombies into certain scenes. It also puts Tamomaru on a leash in a certain scene, changes Kei in the intro, changes the photographs shown at the end, changes the background when Yuki is running to show everything is run-down, changes the color of the sky to a darker tone in several sceneshas some transition changes, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">removes Megu-nee from the intro after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that she has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a> along with putting a grave where she normally is.</span> Episode 10 changes it further. Taromaru has been almost entirely removed from the intro as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is now a zombie</span> and at the logo he is the only one walking <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">very slowly and uncharacteristically unexcitable at that</span>. Megu-nee's scene is changed <em>again</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to show her as a zombie</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Scryed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Scryed">Scryed</a></em> does this so much that there is perhaps one case of the title sequence being re-used <em>without</em> changes in the whole 26-episode series. (Apart from spoiler-based changes, there is also sepia-fading of deceased characters and 3 different main versions for three different verses of the theme tune depending on which of the main characters had the story focus that episode.) The Special Edition DVD set has the option to watch just the opening sequence of each episode.
</li><li> In <em>Anime/Shirobako</em>, the second ending credits has five versions, each of which adds an additional member of the main quintet to the final illustration.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sketchbook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sketchbook">Sketchbook</a></em> changes part of the OP and ED depending on the primary cast of the episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoreGaSeiyuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoreGaSeiyuu">Sore ga Seiyuu!</a></em> combines the ending with recap, trailer, and karaoke sing along for a verse of other Anime opening and ending songs.
</li><li> The third-to-last shot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpacePatrolLuluco">Space Patrol Luluco</a></em>'s opening changes between seasons (read: every three episodes). In first season it's just Luluco. The second season adds Midori and Nova. The third season has all three of them in their uniforms. The fourth season adds <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lalaco standing on some junk and Hisho wheeling around Over Justice, with Luluco removed entirely for episode 11</span>. Each season also changes the color of the text and the speed lines (Red → Green → Blue → Yellow ).
</li><li> Every few episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SSSSGridman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SSSSGridman">SSSS.GRIDMAN</a></em>, the opening scenes change.
<ul><li> Starting from Episode 2, the Neon Genesis group, their forms, and the opening's ending sequence are included.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anosilius the 2nd</span> appears just before the chorus episode 4 onwards.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gridknight</span> replaces the Neon Genesis group in their part after the chorus, and the dropped utility knife <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is bloodied</span> following Episode 10.
</li></ul></li><li> The final episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheGirlWhoLeaptThroughSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheGirlWhoLeaptThroughSpace">The Girl Who Leapt Through Space</a></em> involve Leopard gaining the final parts needed to bring him to full strength. The openings of these last episodes, as a result, show Leopard with these upgrades attached in the final seconds.
</li><li> A few things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful">The World is Still Beautiful</a></em>'s opening changes as episodes progress:
<ul><li> It initially just features Nike wandering around a seemingly empty royal palace. Each episode after that adds more people to the opening — starting with Livius and Neil — after the episode they're introduced.
</li><li> Starting from Episode 4, Nike wears one of her frilly princess dresses instead of her usual casual pink dress, probably to indicate she's grown accustomed to her new home.
</li><li> After Bardouin becomes a fixed character, he is also added in the scene where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Livius has his Glowing Eyes Of Doom, to indicate he too also became a bit more cynical after Sheila's death and the war.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGate">Steins;Gate</a></em> evolves a few episodes from the end of the series, with the lyrics changing to match the change in plot. The animation also has very subtle differences, only noticeable if one really focuses.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokureiSochiDantaiStellaJogakuinKoutoukaC3Bu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokureiSochiDantaiStellaJogakuinKoutoukaC3Bu">Tokurei Sochi Dantai Stella Jogakuin Koutou-ka C³-bu</a></em> changes a few episodes in to reflect Yura's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportantHaircut">Important Haircut</a> and her new, more outgoing personality.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online II</a></em>, episode 6 changes the close-up on Death Gun's pistol to a close-up of his wrist, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which bears the Laughing Coffin logo</span>.
<ul><li> The second opening of <em>Sword Art Online II</em> starts with a focus on "Caliber" characters, it evolves midway to focus on "Mother's Rosario" characters.
</li><li> The second opening of <em>Sword Art Online: Alicization</em> evolves to focus on which enemies Kirito &amp; Eugeo will be facing as they climb the Central Cathedral. The first version features Deusolbert, Fanatio, Alice and Bercouli. The second version features the Sword Golem and Quinella.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoGXP">Tenchi Muyo! GXP</a></em> shows four characters as silhouettes. The first three are obviously Tenchi, Ryoko, and Ayeka from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">original series</a>, who are revealed in the openings of the two episodes that feature them. The fourth is a new character who is revealed after her first appearance in the second half of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em>, the initial opening and the post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> opening. The latter changes the first verses of the theme song; the former, meanwhile, replaces <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kamina with Nia after his death</span>, and shows Simon tying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedArmbandOfLeadership" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedArmbandOfLeadership">Red Armband of Leadership</a> on his arm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheIdolmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheIdolmaster">The Idolmaster</a></em>: All the ending sequences are completely different.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> is a strange case. It does get an update after all five girls become Mew Mews, but it's really only some minor animation details and clips of their attacks that change. What's more, the original opening was fairly spoilerific itself: it revealed who Ichigo's teammates would be, the first villain Kisshu <em>and</em> that he kisses Ichigo.
</li><li> The many Japanese <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> shows are fond of this trend, updating whenever new characters are shown in the series, and typically having at least two opening videos per series.
<ul><li> Special recognition goes to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">Galaxy Force</a></em> series, which in addition to constantly evolving opening credits as new characters get added to the cast also features evolving end credits throughout the series. The first half frames clips from the episode just shown as flashbacks of one of the main characters, while the second half shows all the cast with characters who have yet to show up shown in silhouette only.
</li><li> Also, the Japanese opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, in which in the first opening, we see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Megatron</a> in his Cybertron mode attacking the Autobots with the help of the Starscream clones, while in the second, they now use the second verse of the opening theme song not to mention the fact that the aforementioned animation with Cybertron-mode Megatron and the Starscream clones has been replaced with a new animation showing Megatron in his Earth mode attacking the Autobots with the help of two Soundwaves (the second Soundwave is a different color), two Blackouts (the second Blackout is supposed to represent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Grindor</a>), and Swindle.
</li><li> They're basically a <em>reversal</em> of the usual intent of this trope. Instead of revealing characters one by one, characters who won't be seen for a <em>very</em> long time appear, and some one-shot characters are given screentime to make you think they were as important as Prime himself. Both openings are a thing of beauty, with catchy songs, but they're <em>on crack</em> when held up against the actual events of the show.
</li><li> Just to go into the already-mentioned examples: the black-and-red Soundwave represents <em><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the real Soundwave's virtual world avatar</span></em>, not another character. Also, <em>Grindor is not in TFA <strong>at all</strong></em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ouv6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ouv6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ouv6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Okay, <em>long</em> after the fact, a Grinder (with an E) who is colored nothing like Blackout (unlike Blackout's 100% identical twin in the opening) does appear in a <em>card game.</em></span> and the two Blackouts are perfectly identical (unlike movie Grindor, a blue-gray repaint of movie Blackout) so he <em>is</em> a second Blackout, not Grindor. In the actual show, Blackout appears for all of 20 seconds in the opening scenes of the third season premiere. He gets one line. He doesn't even appear in the virtual world alongside most of the rest of his team. Also, Swindle is a solo operator who'll sell arms to <em>anyone,</em> and is only considered a Decepticon because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">his toy's gotta be sold as something, and he sure ain't no Autobot</a>, and makes little sense as someone to have alongside Megs. This is by no means the full extent.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TsukuyomiMoonPhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TsukuyomiMoonPhase">Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase</a></em>'s Nekomimi Mode OP changes slightly with every episode, including one where Hazuki just plain isn't present <em>at all</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em>'s credits change the initial portrait in the opening every five or so episodes to reflect the change in arcs. And then the third arc started, and the opening underwent a much larger transformation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VampireKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VampireKnight">Vampire Knight</a></em>'s first season does this twice despite the fact that it only runs for 13 episodes: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the first revision of the opening titles introduces Kurenai Maria, a second introduces her true form as Hio Shizuka</span>.
</li><li> The parts of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread">Vandread</a></em> opening that weren't clips from the upcoming episode; dead characters disappeared from the sequence, and if a character's appearance changed in the series, it would change in the opening soon after. Also, certain spoiler-ish aspects were obscured in the opening, only to be revealed once the plot got to them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheVanishingOfNagatoYukiChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheVanishingOfNagatoYukiChan">The Disappearance of Yuki Nagato</a></em>'s credits sequence changes subtly for episodes 10 to 13, to reflect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the emergence of the other Yuki</span>. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the original Yuki returns</span>, the outro also reverts back, but instead of the sparkles escaping, Yuki manages to catch them.
</li><li> Weirdly subverted in the closing credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VisionOfEscaflowne">Vision of Escaflowne</a></em>. For most of the series there is a shot of Hitomi and Allen kissing during the closing credits, however once <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they kiss in the actual show</span> the shot disappears. (This may not hold true for the official American release as it seems to have just picked one version of the credits and stuck it on to every episode. The original VHS American release only use one version, but the DVD's use both.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividredOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividredOperation">Vividred Operation</a></em>'s opening credits feature a montage of the girls' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence">transformation sequences</a>, with each girl's sequence being added the episode after their debut: Aoi in Episode 3, Wakaba in Episode 4, and Himawari in Episode 5.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WelcomeToTheBallroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WelcomeToTheBallroom">Welcome to the Ballroom</a></em>'s closing credits, Tatara is shown dancing on his own in the first four episodes. Starting in episode 5, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after he's partnered with Mako, he's shown dancing with her instead.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WitchcraftWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WitchcraftWorks">Witchcraft Works</a></em>, as new characters are introduced, they get added to the scenery that strolls past about halfway through the song. Some of them join the Tower witches, while others join the Workshop witches group, depending on their affiliation.
</li><li> End credits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> have a white wolf running through landscape that changes slightly with each episode. The last one is particularly interesting.
</li><li> In the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows">The World God Only Knows</a></em>, the ending theme is sung by the girl who is revealed to be having one of the Goddess (except for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tenri</span> which is already revealed on the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tenri Arc OVA</span>) in that episode (except for Episodes 1,7 and 8 which have no ending themes and Episode 9 which has a different ending theme altogether).
</li><li> Both season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Working" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Working">WORKING!!</a></em> have characters added to the opening during the episode they appear in. For the first season, it was just Yamada, but for the second season Haruna, Youhei and Mizuki Mashiba and Kirio are all added to the opening by the seventh episode.
</li><li> In the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YamiShibai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YamiShibai">Yami Shibai</a></em> each episode has an additional creepy head added to the end credits.
</li><li> The second opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril">Your Lie in April</a></em> changed a bit of its lyrics after episode 17 before the reff part. From <em>boku wa ame kimi wa taiyou te o tsunagou</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14fbe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14fbe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14fbe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">I'm the rain, you're the sun, so let's join hands</span> to <em>nee, ima kono isshun o dakishimeyou</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28xbr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note28xbr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28xbr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">hey, let's hold tight this moment</span>. Not only lyrics, but some scenery also changed. They are including:
<ul><li> The changed lyrics parts initially features Kousei, Tsubaki, and Watari playing together, but after episode 17, it features Takeshi and Emi smiled at the sky.
</li><li> The scene while Kousei playing piano and Kaori playing violin accompanied by flying birds changed into scenery of Kousei and Kaori double riding bike together.
</li><li> The scenery while both of them playing in the reff part of opening changed from sunny sky with white cloud into clear night full of twinkling and falling stars.
</li></ul></li><li> In one opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> each of the main character's name and image is shown along with a grid of cards in the background. Some are face down with the face up ones being the cards they used. More gets flipped up as they use new cards in the show. One part of the opening also shows a brief preview of the duel from the episode.
</li><li> The first opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em> does this during the part of Yuma being joined by his friends during a walk. Initially it just Kotori and Tetsuo (<em>ENG:</em> Bronk). After the episodes that introduced them, Takashi (<em>ENG:</em> Casell), Tokunosuke (<em>ENG:</em> Flip) and Cathy are shown joining in as well.
</li><li> The Second opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> changes in episode 48, to reflect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aki and Jack's designated Signer opponents and Ruka recieving Ancient Fairy Dragon</span>.
</li><li> The opening credits for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce">Yuri!!! on Ice</a></em> start off almost entirely monochrome in episode 1. With every episode, though, a few more colour splashes are added, and by the time episode 10 rolls around, the opening credits are almost entirely in full colour.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> keeps the same song for the entire run, the Japanese version changes at some point during the Chapter Black saga, and instead of showing Yusuke and his companions fighting random demons, shows shots of them fighting Sensui, some of their new powers (Kurama's yoko form, Kuwabara's Jigentoh, and Hiei's Dragon of the Darkness Flame), and a few new characters, but this opening isn't shown in the English version of the show. The opening changes slightly for the Three Kings Saga in both versions, as it shows Yusuke falling out of Raizen's tower, Yomi and Mukuro, and some of the former Dark Tournament contestants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YukiYunaIsAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YukiYunaIsAHero">Yuki Yuna is a Hero</a></em>'s intro is constantly changing with almost each episode. Some are major, including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> adding Karin into the intro and showing Togo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> transformation</span> to avoid a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">Spoiler Opening</a> but others are minor, like the flowers in the intro changing to reflect on the characters' Mankai progress at the start of the episode.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em> features this quite a bit. The self-titled first arc features the yellow and black classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> logo slowly being eclipsed by red and purple until the Azrael-Batman logo's debut on the cover of <em>Batman</em> #500. <em>Knightquest</em> kept the same gold and black Azrael-Batman logo throughout, but <em>KnightsEnd</em> features a shattered <em>Knightquest</em> logo falling away, revealing the classic <em>Batman</em> logo.

</li><li> The Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy had its opening credits appear on webs. The second and third films feature images from the previous films in the webs; furthermore, while the second film used comic art, the third film featured actual scenes from the films.

This was to avoid giving away Spock's eventual resurrection and fast-aging (so that he could be played by Nimoy again). It worked because so many people thought Nimoy hated playing Spock, as he allowed him to get killed off in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II</a></em> and wrote a book called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotSpock">I Am Not Spock</a></em>.

Fans have even gone so far as to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh97y5Sqy0o&amp;feature=related">edit together very convincing credits for a hypothetical eighth season<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which happen to have the very sweet touch of Bradley Whitford being introduced at the exact moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSpencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSpencer">John Spencer</a> used to be, as Whitford's character would be taking up the same position as Spencer's.

</li><li> The series shows a few quick glimpses of the content of the episode at the beginning of each title sequence. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider555" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRider555">555</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO">Den-O</a></em> went on to show similar preview clips in their opening sequences. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKabuto">Kabuto</a></em> shoehorned in new opening clips when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gatack</span> was introduced, and so did <em>Den-O</em> for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zeronos</span>. But for a classic example of this trope though, look no further than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlade">Blade</a></em>: it entirely changed (including a brand new theme song) when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leangle</span> showed up.
</li><li> Not quite. <em>Blade</em> plays this straight for some episodes past <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Leangle's</span> debut, properly updating the first opening's visuals to reflect such before they changed the opening altogether. Incidentally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mutsuki</span> is actually present from the first iteration, right before Tachibana's shot, albeit with him pulling his hat over his face to hide it until his debut as a Rider.
</li><li> Of course, the AMV for Opening 1 still features four Riders.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDecade">Kamen Rider Decade</a></em> evolved in two different ways: first, clips of Diend are added after his introduction, second, the opening narration is slightly changed when it becomes apparent that more worlds beyond the Heisei era Riders' will be visited.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderExAid">Kamen Rider Ex-Aid</a> may be reigning king of this trope in the franchise, constantly making minor aesthetics to reflect plot developments, such as new forms, Riders, character deaths, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who the current main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is</span>. This applies even after the more significant evolution starting episode 25. The most egregious case is the differences between the openings of episodes 36 and 37. The former <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> reinstates the resurrected and now evil Kiriya, scowling in a black jacket</span> into his usual spot. 37, on the other hand, , to reflect the two significant plot developments in the previous episode, immediately changes THAT to show <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the revived Kiriya was only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">Reverse Mole</a>, his personal shot changed again to have him smiling with his usual brown jacket, and is back on the heroes' side. Not to mention the addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSuperMode">Hyper Muteki Ex-Aid</a> in the form exhibition.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGladiators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanGladiators">American Gladiators</a></em> revival adds the new gladiators to the title sequence only after they've actually appeared on the show. In addition, gladiators have been removed from the credits due to injury or being part of the reserves.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>, new images of Fred as Illyria were not added to the credits until after the characters [and the audience] discovered they couldn't get Fred back.
<ul><li> Additionally, in season 1 Wesley didn't appear in the credits until after he started working with Angel and Cordelia. His first episode still had Doyle in the credits <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">despite the fact that Doyle had already died in the previous episode.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>: The second season modified its opening after the third episode once a surprise is revealed. It also constantly updated its credit captions throughout the run to reflect change in character status, such as promotions. Unfortunately, the DVD release of the second season did not maintain these changes, and thus a new viewer could be spoiled if watching the opening credits on the first two episodes. They also did a variant credit sequence for the episode "The Corps Is Mother, The Corps Is Father", reflecting the episode's focus on Psi Corps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateeSackhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateeSackhoff">Katee Sackhoff</a>'s name was removed from the opening credits after her character's death.
</li><li> Additionally, they update the survivor count in the introduction every episode.
</li><li> There is also a variant opening with different clips and no survivor count during the New Caprica arc possibly to hide how bad things had really gotten on New Caprica, so the revelation to the characters themselves in show would have more impact, or more simply because the governing president wasn't updating the white board.
</li><li> The Cylon part of the opening ("The Cylons were created by man...") also evolved over the course of the series. Season 1 used a longer version than the other seasons with lines focusing on Boomer's status as a "sleeper agent." Season 4 changed to a whole new wording focusing on the Final Five (which also evolved as the other characters learned their identities). <em>The Plan</em> went back to the original wording, but it was done as a voiceover by the various Cylon characters. They also updated the footage in each season to reflect which Cylons were known to the audience.
</li></ul></li><li> Miller Boyett shows did this out of necessity; in addition to reflecting cast changes, reshoots were done to reflect character development.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> did not add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleTrachtenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichelleTrachtenberg">Michelle Trachtenberg</a> to the opening credits until the second episode of the fifth season to so as not to completely spoil her surprise appearance at the end of the premiere (though she is still credited as a guest star).
</li><li> Especially common in Reality Competition shows:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Survivor">Survivor</a></em>
<ul><li> In the <em>Guatemala</em> season, two extra contestants (returning from the previous season) were added to the opening after being introduced post-opening in the first episode. The <em>China</em> season was the first of several to change its titles post-merge to show who was still competing and who was on the jury. <em>Micronesia</em> had eliminated contestants being removed from the opening, along with implementing the <em>China</em>-style post-merge titles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> does a version of this as well; ejected housemates have a clip of them leaving the house replacing their appearance in the intro.
</li><li> Every season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMole">The Mole</a></em> (except the first possibly) updated the credits each episode. The status of players who had left the game was displayed when their name and picture appeared in the credits.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em> revises its opening titles around the sixth episode in each season. Early on each team has an "in their home environment" shot before a turn-to-the-camera-and/or-the-camera-pans-to-you portraits, both filmed in a single session (Sometimes just the same shot from two angles). In the revised credits each team's first shot is from one of the first episodes. Teams eliminated early are usually shown in their fatal challenges, while the continuing teams at that point team are shown doing other challenges or in transport - occasionally also a Crowning Moment of Funny.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em>
<ul><li> The title sequences for the shows change after a bit to include the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>, Megazord, Battlizers, etc.
</li><li> The season that holds record for fewest opening changes is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue">Lightspeed Rescue</a></em>, at a mere <em>one</em> change (only adding its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a>, and nothing else), but some are <em>always</em> changing. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersOperationOverdrive">Power Rangers Operation Overdrive</a></em> changes to add a new Ranger, to update Miratrix's hairstyle, to add every new Megazord formation, to add a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> for Mack, and... sometimes just because they feel like it, it seems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> shows only four Rangers in its first opening and continues to feature Divatox from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em> as if she'll be remaining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, the better to keep the arrival of new Ranger Andros and new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Astronema hidden until their debut later that episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em> has several, due to <em>any character who isn't in the episode</em> being left out, as well as permanent new characters being added. (The exception being Kendrix's departure, due to the actress' leukemia. She was left in the opening for the duration.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersRPM">Power Rangers RPM</a></em> is a strange case. The initial opening only showed four of the rangers, but mentioned important characters or actors. They even showed Tanaya 7, who wouldn't appear for several episodes to begin with. This was then changed to showing Milo Cawthorne as Ziggy, the Green Ranger, when he officially joined the team and, changed again later, a clip of Olivia Tennet portraying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Doctor K</span>, once revealed.
</li></ul></li><li> Each season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> uses a different version of the theme song, "Way Down in the Hole", and a different montage during the opening credits, which reflect the mood of each season. The montages integrate clips from previous seasons and out-of-context clips that become clear much later on.
</li><li> The opening titles to the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWorstWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWorstWitch">The Worst Witch</a></em> did not feature Mildred and her friends. Instead we saw the shots we usually see of all of the other witches (as well as one of a witch descending in front of the gate which didn't end up in the proper opening). The school song (used as the show's opening theme) was also not played and instead an instrumental BGM was. It was from the second episode onward we saw Mildred and her friends (bar Enid, who wasn't added until after her debut episode) flying on broomsticks and the school song was used as the opening theme.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>
<ul><li> The first episode opening does not show the wormhole, because it's only discovered in that episode.
</li><li> Later seasons replaces the runabout with the <em>Defiant</em> after it was introduced at the beginning of season 3.
</li><li> Starting with season 4, the original arrangement of the opening theme was replaced with a more ominous version, possibly to reflect on the darker turn the series had taken with the introduction of the Dominion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>. There's also a lot more activity shown around the station in general, to reflect that the fact it's become a seat of power, rather than the abandoned husk nobody cared much about that it once was.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening credits for the pilot episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em> did show the sisters casting a spell, but not their individual powers. Plus, the title sequence was altered regularly to only show actors who appear in the episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em> has a new credit sequence every season after the second, and adds casts members as they are introduced.
</li><li> British satirical show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou">Have I Got News for You</a></em> changes its introductory sequence from season to season, to reflect recent news stories. The one constant is that it opens by zooming through London to focus on Big Ben.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Series 49</a>'s intro depicted a squabble between the leaders of the various opposition parties, referencing the upcoming general election. The election occurred just before Episode 5 was being filmed, and over the course of the episode, three of the opposition leaders <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3bwpe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3bwpe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3bwpe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">UKIP's Nigel Farage, the Liberal Democrats' Nick Clegg, and Labour's Ed Miliband</span> were revealed to have resigned. From Episode 6 onwards, their faces were crudely scribbled out of the intro.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger">Henry Danger</a></em> updates its title sequence with new scenes every episode. Henry's introduction is also redubbed to reflect Jace Norman's puberty.
<ul><li> As a strange example of this, Riele Downs and Sean Ryan Fox's positions in the credits are switched around every other episode.
</li></ul></li><li> Australian soap opera <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em> has as its title sequence a montage of all the main characters that are in the show at that time (not just the characters who show up in the storylines for that particular episode, though which storylines will be continued in a given ep is spoiled by the "previously on" catch-up before the title sequence). Whenever a character or characters join the main cast or leave/die, the title sequence montage is updated to reflect this...though not always immediately.
<ul><li> In some versions of its title sequence, rival Australian soap opera <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway">Home and Away</a></em> would also use evolving credits showing the current main cast. Again, just because a new arrival isn't on the credits, doesn't mean that they're not staying long...they might just not have been added to the credits quite yet.
</li><li> By contrast, British soap operas don't tend to use title sequences that show the show's characters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a> has an establishing shot of the titular street, Eastenders has a title screen of a map of the London area, and Emmerdale has establishing shots of the rural setting. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hollyoaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a></em> however, <em>does</em> show images of its main cast. Unfortunately they only update the credits every so often, and with Hollyoaks being a quiet suburb with the mortality rate of a Mafia blood feud, it means that on occasion a good proportion of the characters in the montage are currently dead. Later on it gets updated more often but still doesn't change immediately after a character change.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastenders">Eastenders</a></em> did, however, update the title sequence when the Millennium Dome (now the O2 Arena) was built at pretty much the focal point of their map.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em>'s opening sequence was originally a series of fringe science-related words flashing on a blue background, some of which would relate to that season's themes. The season two finale, which took place in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>, introduced a new sequence with a red background; during the next season, the color of the intro indicated on which side the episode took place. The season three finale was set 15 years later in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> and featured a silver background along with a mixture of scientific concepts and basic necessities that have been lost, such as "water" and "hope". Season four brings us a yellow sequence, signifying either <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the new Peter-less timeline</span> or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the fact that the two universes are bridged</span>. Finally, the fifth and final season uses a cold blue sequence, and ditches the fringe science terms for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> words like "freedom" and "private thought" for things the conquered Earth has lost</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> The opening sequence is a sweeping flyover of a map of Westeros, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk">Clock Punk</a>-themed cities and castles, changes from episode to episode, depending on where members of the main cast are at any given time and new locations are periodically added to the opening title sequence as the story moves into new regions.
</li><li> Major changes to locations are accounted for: from season three to season five <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Winterfell, which has been burned down, billows clouds of smoke,</span>. Season eight introduces many changes including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Wall having a hole in it, the interiors of important locations being shown and major locations being visited in reverse order from previous seasons</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long Runner</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">swaps out its main character as a matter of course</a>, the credits for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> have gone through <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjMR98ODhS4">many<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> changes.
<ul><li> The most extreme example has to be the credits sequences of Series 7.1, which grew progressively darker with each episode. Also, during that same series, the show logo gained unique textures in keeping with that episode's plot (e.g. for "Asylum of the Daleks," the logo was covered with Dalek bumps).

The final shot of the credits originally showed Hawkeye and Trapper riding on the jeeps headed back to the camp. After Wayne Rogers left the show, they kept the shot, but reframed it to crop Trapper out.
<ul><li> For Season Four, the shot of Trapper scurrying to a chopper is removed, and replaced with a shot of B.J. rushing towards the chopper, from a distance, making him somewhat indistinguishable. Afterwards, a clearer of shot B.J. helping casualty from the chopper's rumble seat is used for Seasons Five and Six. Similarly, the same shot was used for the first couple of episodes for Season Seven, before we see on the show itself that B.J. now has a mustache; afterwards, a close up of a mustachioed B.J. is used in the opening credits for the rest of the series.
</li><li> A subtle one, but after Gary Burghoff left the show the opening moment of the credits, which is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverTheShoulder">Over the Shoulder</a> shot of Radar looking at the choppers coming in, is cropped to take Radar out of the picture.

Whenever a main cast member joined or left the series, the opening credits would be amended to include or remove them.
<ul><li> Season 2 saw the theme music extended by five seconds to accomodate the extra cast. However, the music was never extended again, despite the number of cast in the opening increasing from seven in Season 2 to <em>thirteen</em> in Season 6.
</li><li> The constant changes resulted in there being an incredible <em>thirty-three</em> distinct variations of the opening credits. Both Seasons 6 and 8 alone had six variations each just within the season.

He was moved to first in the lineup when Sipowicz was partnered with detectives played by the <em>considerably</em> younger Rick Schroeder and Mark-Paul Gosselaar.

</li><li> The second season credit sequence for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectUFO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectUFO">Project UFO</a></em> was significantly changed from the first. While justified in part by the recasting of the "lead officer" role, the cast members weren't actually shown in the first season credits. The new credits include 40 seconds of spaceship special effects shots plus footage of the leads taking off in an Air Force fighter jet. It's all more suggestive of a science-fiction action-adventure show than what the show actually was — a "just the facts" procedural in which, as in real life, the Air Force never found conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial visitors.
</li><li> This happened to the opening credits sequence for season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Grimm">Grimm</a></em>, such as with the inclusion of Captain Renard's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a> following its much-anticipated reveal during episode 2.

The original was taken before the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">really established itself</a> and thus has a few unusual quirks unique to the pilot such as: Penny has a much different hairstyle than normal, Raj is wearing a reddish ball cap that is never seen again and the white boards filled with equations are displayed prominently (they show up from time to time, but are not a mainstay of the apartment set design). The third season had a new one that reflected the series slightly better and the fifth season added a new shot where Penny is taking a really big bite. The sixth season finally includes the latest cast additions Amy and Bernadette.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em>'s credits were redone in season five to update the children's ages, swap in a new, older actress for Lily, and add Gloria and Jay's new baby Joe. It was done again partway through season seven to update the ages again, as Joe was no longer an infant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em> is an interesting example, the credits don't change, but the Netflix title card changes with Matt Murdock looking increasingly beat up, and finally wearing the Daredevil costume after the viewer has finished season 1.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MockTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MockTheWeek">Mock the Week</a></em>: The title sequence features clips of famous people (Mostly politicians) with hilarious captions.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven">7th Heaven</a></em> changed its title sequence to include the actors who appeared in the episode, while also adding new characters into the sequence (when they appeared anyway). These changes occurred almost every episode.

For the first seven episodes it's fairly subtle, but the eighth episode, after Kennedy's assassination is stopped, has things really different.
</li><li> <em>The Durrells</em>, an adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeraldDurrell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeraldDurrell">Gerald Durrell</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyFamilyAndOtherAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MyFamilyAndOtherAnimals">Corfu Trilogy</a>, has opening titles consisting of semi-animated artwork depicting events in the series, and changed each season.

</li><li> The second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> replaces the Klingon symbols — since the Klingon war is over and the season is about a new potential threat — with the Red Angel and the Section 31 version of the Starfleet logo. After the true nature of the Red Angel is revealed in "The Sounds of Thunder", the image of it is changed to reflect this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Outlander">Outlander</a></em> regularly changes its credits sequence to reflect each season's shifting storyline. Season 1 was pure Scottish Highlands; Season 2 mixes it with a trip to France; Season 3 adds in modern touches as Claire returns to the 20th century before coming back to the 18th and later the pair heading to Jamaica; Season 4 has Claire and Jamie in colonial America and season 5 with them joined by Claire's grown daughter and the coming Revolution. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingMusic">the theme song</a> regularly shifts to capture these changes (compare the pure Scottish themes of season 1 to the American influence of season 5).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> had a title sequence that by necessity changed as the seasons went on, but there was more to it than simply adding the names of new members of the cast. The sequence memorably used old-timey art and photographs that not only established Cheers as being a century-old bar, but the people in the pictures were chosen to be counterparts of the characters as well. This meant old pictures had to be dropped and new ones added. The iconic picture of a well-dressed woman reclining on a table while raising her glass with a male companion had to be removed after Shelley Long left the cast, as the image represented the relationship between Diane and Sam. Ted Danson instead got a solo picture of a moustachioed bartender (very similar to the one used for Nicholas Colasanto when he was still alive, a nice subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a> nod). New pictures were also added for Woody Harrelson (a teenage bar worker), Kirstie Alley (a middle-aged barmaid), Kelsey Grammer (a doctor sitting by himself), and Bebe Neuwirth (a pale, gaunt woman who bears an amusing resemblance to Lilith).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em> started out with a cardboard cutout style for it's intro, which was updated slightly in season 2, notably by changing the text to a darker shade of blue and by adding Richard Karn. The entire sequence was changed in season 4 into a completely different, abstract style, which included the Taylor family kids being shown in a pixelated video game style. Season 7 brought about yet another complete sequence style change, one which also began crediting Debbe Dunning.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SisterSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SisterSister">Sister, Sister</a></em> started out with stop motion effects and animation sequences as the original version of the theme song is played in the background for the first four seasons. For the final two seasons to mark the twins' maturity, the opening credits for seasons 5 and 6 abandon the stop motion/animation sequence to make room for a music video sequence.

This is carried over from the N64 game, where the final scene before the title screen is the silhouettes of the secret characters, that are revealed as they are unlocked. The 3DS game opens with a line-up of all the playable characters, again excluding ones that haven't been revealed or purchased.
<ul><li> Also, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Isle of the Ancients is destroyed during the plot</span>, it is replaced on the title screen with a large glowing X in the distance.

The first game has a train that fills up with each member of Class VII that joins the party. 2 starts out with Rean all alone in the Eisengard Range after the events of 1.

The sequences change based on how far in the game you've gotten so far.
</li><li> The original and <em>Alter Code F</em> have one generic clip used throughout the game. <em>Wild ARMs 2</em> and <em>4</em> have two different clips, which generally appear halfway through the game (on the second disk in the case of 2). <em>Wild ARMs 3</em> goes mad with this though, having no fewer than five variations of the opening credits, not counting the different songs which also play in the background which evolve independently of the video footage. Though to be fair the versions were mostly the same, all that changed was a bit in the middle that showed the current villains for that point in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> The technical limitations of <em>Wrestlemania 2000</em> let you play with this as it used in game models and costumes during its intro, which could be edited.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a></em> features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolvingMusic">thicker instrumentation for the title theme for every world you unlock</a>. And when you unlock that last world...the whole rotating world's appearance changes too.

After World 6, the theme plays immediately.
</li><li> For a extremely rare case of a console's BIOS pulling this trope, look no further than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a>'s booting screen.

Subsequently, the memory card will log each separate game you play on the system in a save file called "Your System Configuration", which has the effect of adding one white block per game on the startup screen. Furthermore, the more you play a specific game, the more its designated block will grow in height. And as you might have guessed by now, deleting the "Your System Configuration" file will devolve the screen back to an empty void.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps">Game Grumps</a></em> updated the intro after Jon left and was replaced with Dan.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SteamTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SteamTrain">Steam Train</a></em> debuted a new intro for its first anniversary, where Ross is conducting the train and Danny, Arin, Barry and Suzy are all passengers; compare this to the original intro which only featured Ross and Danny (with alternate endings if Arin was involved as well). The new intro is more in line with Ross' vision of the show, where he'd host and other Game Grumps members would come in and out depending on the game (although Barry and Suzy were only involved in four-player <em>Steam Rolled</em> series, save for four holiday-themed episodes for Barry). When Brian joined the Grumps permanently, he was added as a face popping out from the top of the carriage.
<ul><li> The Saint Patrick's Day holiday series <em>Stout Train</em> (with Barry and Ross) averts this, by keeping the same intro since it started. Except for adding any third player's face at the end, with Ross drunkingly stating, "Also [whoever]!"
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Grumpcade</em> has the most variation. In general, there are three versions, for two players (with the two players shown as heads being picked with a claw crane), three players (with the players as faces on the each reel of a slot machine), and four players (with the players being selected on an arcade machine), but whenever anybody apart from Arin, Danny, Barry, Suzy, Ross or Brian is playing, one of the heads is a nondescript face with a question mark, before introducing the "guest" player.

</li><li> The most complicated intros were made when Ross played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioKart">Super Mario Kart</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Markiplier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Markiplier">Markiplier</a>, since Arin (who animates the intros) accidentally spelt Mark's wrong, but decided to turn it into a running gag, giving us Markipiler, Markiplire, Mairkpleirr, Parkilimer, Mdaosfjjh$(fv, and finally Markiplier.
</li><li> The intros for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Miitopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Miitopia">Miitopia</a> series had Jimmy Whetzel as a guest, but for some reason the series had the two-player intro despite Holly also playing with them, so the intro pauses in a faux-VHS way as she's introduced. When Matt joins in from episode 9, he pops up at the end of the intro to introduce himself. Holly's and Matt's intros are also different for each episode.

In addition, the third season replaced Pinky &amp; the Brain's verse with one on Ralph, Dr. Scratchansniff, and Hello Nurse after the two mice were given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain">their own spin-off</a>.

</li><li> During the third season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChalkZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChalkZone">ChalkZone</a></em>, the clips from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhYeahCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhYeahCartoons">Oh Yeah!

</li><li> In the second season premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>, Danny gets a new "D" logo added to his uniform, and it's subsequently reflected in the show's intro the following episode, lasting to the series finale.

It changed slightly in Season 5 to reflect the removing of the "Star Catching" element in the previous seasons. A new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDVisualsThreeDEffects">2D Visuals, 3D Effects</a> opening was introduced in Season 7, along with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a> for the show and the transition to HD.

As the series goes on, more details are added to sequence to reference the developments of various seasons and episodes:
<ul><li> The opening is changed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero">Season 2 episode 3</a> to include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">the Cutie Mark Crusaders, Big Macintosh, more background ponies</a> and the Friendship Express train, as well as an additional appearance of Canterlot and the mountains in the background.

</li><li> The opening is changed again in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E1PrincessTwilightSparklePart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E1PrincessTwilightSparklePart1">the season 4 premiere</a>; Twilight Sparkle has her wings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Discord</a> is seen peeking out from inside Fluttershy's cottage, Princess Luna is beside her sister Celestia when she receives a letter from Twilight, and the picture of Twilight and her friends enclosed in said letter is seen being taken by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Photo Finish</a> and includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdedCastShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrowdedCastShot">Spike, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, Snips and Snails, Mr. and Mrs. Cake, Big Macintosh, Granny Smith, Mayor Mare, and Zecora</a>.

</li><li> For season 7, Starlight Glimmer no longer looks nervous. Also, the show's logo has been updated with the franchise's new logo.
</li><li> Season 8 has <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg251_PxACc">a completely different opening<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, featuring (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">among others</a>) DJ-PON3, the Wonderbolts, Princess Ember, and King Thorax for the first time.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Hilda">Hilda</a></em>: The opening credits shows Hilda running through different scenes depending on what she, along with her friends and family, will be facing this season.
<ul><li> The most significant change is that the montage, before the logo, ends with Hilda and her Mum, Johanna. In Season 1, Mum is seen smiling and spins Hilda around. However in Season 2, slated to stream on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix">Netflix</a> this December, the new opening features a concerned Johanna as she struggles to keep up with Hilda and fails to catch her in time when she falls, only for a white woff to fly Hilda to safety. This can easily foreshadow that Hilda and her Mum have a rift and falling out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheOwlHouse">The Owl House</a></em>:

</li></ul></li><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PAWPatrol">PAW Patrol</a></em> progressed, the opening credits changed a lot.
<ul><li> At the beginning of Season 3, the credits were updated to include Everest. The scene for the "no job's too big" verse was also changed from the pups getting Alex and Cali out of a tree to the pups, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenAdult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenAdult">Cap'n Turbot</a>, getting Alex and a a dinosaur egg off of a cliff.
</li><li> In Season 4, the "whenever there's a problem" verse's animation was changed to showcase the Sea Patrol gear.
</li><li> In Season 5, every time there was a new Ultimate Rescue, the theme song would change to show footage from that specific UR.
</li><li> In Season 6, the theme song showed footage from the first 2 "Mighty Pups, Super PAWs" episodes starting with "When Super Kitties Attack." It was then updated again later in the season to include footage from the first "Charged Up" episode, "Pups vs. the Copycat."

For example, the first season has images of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot">Pilot</a> and the fourth season has pictures of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbTheMovieAcrossThe2ndDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbTheMovieAcrossThe2ndDimension">Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension</a></em> and the third season.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> used the same opening for 5 seasons: a Mad Scientist finds the corpse of a chicken who tried to cross the road, but got run over. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingRoboticisation">revives the dead chicken with robotic enhancements</a>, then straps him to a chair and forces him to watch the show. As the show goes on, this intro has changed...
<ul><li> At the Season 5 finale, the Robot Chicken managed to escape and get his revenge on the Mad Scientist.
</li><li> The Season 6 intro gas the Robot Chicken get his revenge by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">doing everything done to him to the Mad Scientist</a>.
</li><li> The Season 8 intro has the Robot Chicken frozen in the Arctic in the future. He is located by the Mad Scientist's descendant and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">is revived and stuck in the chair again</a>
</li><li> The Season 10 intro has the Mad Scientist and Robot Chicken dig up the Nerd's corpse (since he'd killed himself in the Season 9 finale for an Evil Knievel stunt) and revive him for the chair.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RustyRivets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RustyRivets">Rusty Rivets</a></em> changed its theme in Season 2 to reflect the new mobile lab and also to introduce the new robot animals, Botarilla, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerBot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerBot">Tiger Bot</a>, and ElephantBot.
</li><li> After nearly twenty years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> finally updated the opening when the show switched to HD. It's essentially the same, but with some added background material that includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> and a bunch of characters introduced after the second season. Which itself is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>: the show's first season had an opening different from the one used for the next 18 seasons.
</li><li> The final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> had changes to a few scenes in the opening credits, most notably the ending shot with the title. It changed depending on who joined the Rebellion, and who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">mind-controlling chips</a> implanted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShimmerAndShine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShimmerAndShine">Shimmer and Shine</a></em>'s theme song was updated slightly after the first episode to include clips from various episodes of Season 1. Season 2 redoes the theme and sequence entirely to reflect the story shifting to Zahramay Falls and the animation having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiftedToCGI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiftedToCGI">Shifted to CGI</a>, and rewords some of the lyrics. The theme changes again in the third and fourth seasons to reflect the themes for Rainbow Zahramay and Zahramay Skies, respectively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em>:

</li><li> Another title sequence was introduced in the third season to reflect Sofia's dress change and the new pink version of the logo. Same goes for Season 4 to include the Mystic Isles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: Kenny's (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">muffled</a>) line in the opening theme changes every few seasons. As for the opening itself...
<ul><li> The first four seasons gradually added new characters, objects, and events to the opening over course of the seasons.
</li><li> Eventually they switched to a new opening consisting of clips from the series and a group shot at the end that was updated every season.
</li><li> The broadcast version of <em>South Park</em> continues the addition of characters to its opening for each episode long after the Comedy Central version had stopped doing so. This resulted in an absolutely chaotic-looking opening as the show reached and exceeded its 200th episode.
</li><li> Season 17 completely changed the intro again, to a 3D computer animated one imitating a 3D version of the show's cardboard style. The opening started with the main characters stepping on the school bus and followed them on the way to school, panning over reoccurring places and characters on the way.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em> added Mary Jane to the titles after her inevitable "jackpot" introduction. Also, during the second season, the intro becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentInEveryEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentInEveryEpisode">Different in Every Episode</a> to indicate which supporting characters will play major roles.
</li><li> As of the episode "Lame and Fortune", the theme song of ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> has been digitally remastered by simply tracing over the original animation and putting it in a 16:9 format as well as giving the island at the start a CGI look.

</li><li> An entirely new opening credits sequence is used for the last two seasons, due to the show switching its main location from Earth to Mewni, but this trope comes into play after the events of season three's "Battle for Mewni" arc, wherein <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Star's wand regains its missing fragment and takes on a new form</span>. The wand's appearance is updated to match from that point forward.

<ul><li> The first three seasons have the end credits of each episode play segments of a full song as part of its ending credits: for example, some episodes will have individual instruments playing, while others may have the full instrumental, and still others the music and lyrics. Overall, discounting a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEditionTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEditionTitle">oddballs</a>, the first three seasons had <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">twenty</a></strong> different ending themes that come together to form "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F8HvKqnp5s">Love Like You<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>".

</li></ul></li><li> The opening speech of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheatricalCartoons">Superman Theatrical Cartoons</a> underwent a small change after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> learned how to fly. Originally, it went, "Faster than a speeding bullet! More powerful than a locomotive! Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!" The updated speech used, "Able to soar higher than any plane!" for the third line. Then, when production transferred from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaxAndDaveFleischer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaxAndDaveFleischer">Fleischer Studios</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamousStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamousStudios">Famous Studios</a>, the speech completely changed. Also, the only short in which Superman used his X-ray vision ("The Mechanical Monsters") added the line "Empowered with X-ray vision" and briefly shows X-rays coming from Superman's eyes during the intro.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TangledTheSeries">Tangled: The Series</a></em>, the opening completely changes from season to season, though it keeps the same song and framing device (Rapunzel drawing on her diary and writing things about her friends interspersed with clips from the show).
</li><li> Midway through the fourth season of the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> cartoon, the show's opening was altered to take out scenes featuring the old vehicles (which had been destroyed) and Foot Ninja (which had been redesigned), replacing them with newer versions of each. Also, the scene featuring the Shredder, which had been altered to reflect his ultimate defeat, was altered yet again to reflect Karai's debut as his replacement.
<ul><li> Both of the other cartoons have done so as well. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">80's cartoon</a> featured a completely brand-new animated intro in the middle of the fourth season when the show went from syndication <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">to</a> Saturday mornings on CBS. And for the 2012 cartoon..
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em>. The opening of Season 2 has added most of the Turtles' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> from Season 1 to the "villains" part of the opening, featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToOpeningTitles">Ms. Cambell, Kraang Prime, Snakeweed, Spider Bytez, Newtralizer, The Rat King,</a> Xever, Bradford, Karai, and Shredder.
<ul><li> A lesser example has Metalhead and Pulverizer (in his mutagen form) in Donnie's portion of the intro, and Casey Jones leaning on the building as the turtles run up to the rooftop at the end.
<ul><li> Starting with "Wormquake/The Manhattan Project", the villains went through slight change to depict Kraang Prime, a Squirrelanoid, Slash, Mutagen Man, Bradford/Rahzar, Fishface, Tiger Claw, Karai and Shredder. Also, the part near the ending that has Leo cutting two Kraangdroids and Donnie peeking out of a manhole is replaced with the turtles firing grappling hooks and using them as zip lines. However <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Spike is still shown with Raphael after the Slash episode.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Season 3 changes things up again to feature mostly the Foot Clan, with Baxter Stockman added, while most of the mutants nonaffiliated with the Foot are removed... except for the Newtralizer.
</li><li> Starting with Return to New York, the intro is changed a lot, with the Party Wagon replacing the Shellraiser, the turtles wearing their "Vision Quest" outfits, a scene with Splinter and April training together, and a car chase featuring the turtles, Leatherhead, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bebop and Rocksteady, and Mondo Gecko.</span>
</li><li> The first half of season 4 has the intro interrupted by a Triceraton soldier stepping on the manhole cover at the beginning, followed by Leo recapping the events of the season 3 finale and new scenes of the Turtles, April and Casey in space. The second half is the first intro with new scenes and Karai and Shinigami added to the background near the end.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TopWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TopWing">Top Wing</a></em> changes its opening partly into Season 2 to reflect the team in their new base outfits and uniforms, and having Speedy and Bea pilot the Command Flyer.
</li><li> Each season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> has a subtly different opening. Some episodes that focus on specific characters have special openings, like the season two and three openers.
<ul><li> They also reflect evolving character features, most notably Hank and Dean's divergent style selections at the start of Season 4.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>: The second season's credit had a character added to the heroes' group after 4 episodes, when it was revealed <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a></span>.
</li><li> The opening to the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WildWestCowboysOfMooMesa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WildWestCowboysOfMooMesa">Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa</a></em> had clips of some of the second season's new villains spliced in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> takes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by changing the title sequence <em>every</em> season, with the addition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacedTheThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacedTheThemeTune">Replaced the Theme Tune</a>.
<ul><li> A more straight example for this would be halfway through Season 5, which replaces the title sequence with 3D scenes showing the Winx in their Sirenix and traversing the Infinite Ocean. It does it again in Season 6 to reflect the aquisition of the Mythix power. The Cinelume dub of the third season also does this partly through Season 3, to include scenes of the Winx in their Enchantix.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WITCH">W.I.T.C.H.</a></em> has a completely different set of opening titles for the second season, showing the villains of the new arc as well as updating other aspects. The theme song is also ever so slightly remixed. This is only for the UK/European release, however. The US version keeps the same opening for both seasons, which makes little sense when it displays villains who barely appear in the second season.
