<div class="indent">— <strong>Nnoitra Gilga</strong> explaining an aversion, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>
</div></div><p><em>The less actively a combatant pursues his own defense in a fight, the less likely he <strong>needs</strong> to.</em>
</p><p>The corollary: <em>Any attack that forces someone who normally ignores self-defense to dodge (or block) the attack is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">an attack that can kill him in one hit</a>.</em>

</p><p>Although there are some real-life examples, attempting to use this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> is more likely to cause quick and stupid deaths. It just doesn't work if you do it on purpose.
</p><p>The sad (terrifying) fact is that this is an instinctive response called the Peltzman effect, where the person will take more risks according to how safe he is in some kind of internal (insane) sense of balance. But since humans tend normally to overestimate their benefits... the result is nasty. Worse is that it's a constant effect that people do without realizing day after day. Not so different from pain tolerance; expected pain "hurts" less than surprise pain.

<ul><li> <em>Very</em> common in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> franchise, whether between one of the ridiculously powerful main characters and an ordinary human, or by a villain to show how far above the hero they are. As early as the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Raditz makes light of Piccolo's power, stands there and allows himself to be blasted, and when the smoke clears...
<div class="indent"><strong>Raditz</strong>: Goodness! You've managed to singe some of my leg hairs.
</div><ul><li> Played with by Cell, who lets Vegeta taunt him into standing still to take a Final Flash, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope">an attack that notably takes a few minutes to properly execute.</a> As he is about to be struck, he cries out in surprise, and moves aside, but his arm and a part of his upper torso are blown off. Vegeta, seeing the damage he's done, is very pleased with himself, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until Cell reveals that it was all a ruse, regenerates the damage, and proceeds to beat the snot out of Vegeta.</span>
</li><li> Up until the Cell Saga, Kuririn/Krillin had a technique called Kienzan/Destructo-Disc, which was powerful but easy to dodge. So powerful, in fact, that it was the only technique among the secondary characters to actually break their enemies Diminished Effort. When he uses it against Nappa in the Saiyan arc, he is the first to do some actual damage to Nappa, and only because Nappa actually dodged it at the last moment thanks Vegeta's warning (Vegeta is later seen using a similar technique to cut off Great Ape Gohan's tail, which is how he knew it was dangerous enough to kill Nappa). In the Frieza arc, Krillin uses the technique again on Frieza and is the first to actually damage him in his first transformation by cutting his tail off (though, again, one has to wonder how Frieza figured out the attack would actually hurt him). It is only in the Cell arc that the Law of Diminishing Efforts comes back to haunt him as Krillin uses a barrage of attacks against Perfect Cell, including the Kienzan, and the Kienzan uselessly breaks against Cell's neck who does absolutely no effort in dodging this attack. Note that Perfect Cell isn't any more or less arrogant than both Frieza or Vegeta, and yet both of these figured they actually HAD to dodge this attack while Cell figured he didn't have to. However, Cell was capable of regenerating from just a head anyway so it wouldn't have killed him even if it HAD worked and Cell knew this. Later one of the Cell Jrs. uses the Disc against Super Saiyan 2 Gohan, and it's the only technique out of all of the ones they throw at him Gohan doesn't just stand/float there and take the blow and instead dodges.
</li><li> Its worth nothing that Cell resisting the Kienzan was an anime only scene. It did <em>not</em> appear in the manga, and general statements by Toriyama related to the Kienzan mean that it's generally interpreted as being a mistake on the part of the anime.
</li><li> During Goku's fight with Spike the Devil Man, Spike decides to use his Devilmite Beam attack. Master Roshi freaks out, quickly explains that the attack is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> to any being with a shred of evil in them, and yells at Goku to dodge it. Goku takes it head-on because he couldn't understand what Roshi was saying and he thought the beam was pretty. It's a good thing Goku is pure of heart or else he would have died.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, at one point in the Tournament of Power, Jiren just finds a secluded spot and meditates. A bunch of other competitors see this as an opportunity to defeat him, but they're repelled back by the force field surrounding him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kenpachi Zaraki is perfectly content to let his opponents attack him, and actually encourages them to go for the eye or the throat. The first time Ichigo tried to hit Kenpachi with his sword, Ken was unharmed, and Ichigo's hands got hurt from the impact. However, even when his enemies show they <em>can</em> cut him, he still rarely bothers to dodge or defend and lets them keep hitting him so he can get in the perfect range to strike back. This almost got him in trouble fighting Nnoitra, as he underestimated how much damage Nnoitra was actually doing to his body and made him sober up on the realization that if he didn't take him out <em>now</em>, he'd bleed to death in the long run.
</li><li> Also, Nnoitra Gilga fits it pretty well, especially the corollary during his fight with Kenpachi. He doesn't actually dodge any of Kenpachi's attacks until Kenpachi aims for the head, giving Kenpachi the proof he needs that Nnoitra's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">hierro</a> <em>isn't</em> actually invincible. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">However,</a> Nnoitra replies that it's just natural instinct to dodge a sword coming for the head, and when Kenpachi goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">a stab through the eye,</a> he makes the mistake of aiming for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower">Eyepatch of Power</a>, which actually covers Nnoitra's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorsoWithAView" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorsoWithAView">Hollow hole</a> and opens him to a retaliatory strike. That said, Nnoitra's smugness quickly fades once Kenpachi finally figures out the trick to cutting him and he's forced to start parrying and dodging rather than tanking.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aizen</span> <em>averts</em> this for a while, using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfIllusion">illusions</a> to avoid attacks he could probably easily tank anyway. But when he reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>,</span> he adheres fully to this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> During Fate and Signum's first battle, Signum calmly put a field around her and just stood there with her eyes closed as Fate launched <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Photon Lancer</a>. The energy missiles just bounced off of her. Later in the battle, when Fate charged at Signum with her axe, Signum actively dodged it. In the next episode, it's revealed that Fate had managed to wound her then.
</li><li> Averted with Reinforce Eins, who isn't averse to using external barriers to stop her opponents' attacks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nanoha pierces her barrier, fires an Exelion Buster point-blank at her... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">and she isn't even scratched</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em>StrikerS</em>, Fate develops a "defensive costume" that trades <em>all</em> protection for a massive speed boost. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Numbers</a>' best fighter immediately recognizes that a single hit that connects will kill Fate. What she fails to realize is that in a high-speed battle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastestThingAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastestThingAlive">you CAN'T land a hit on Fate.</a>
</li><li> Yuuno was good at two things, barriers and teleportation. When he's seen fighting Vita in the second episode of <em>A's</em>, he nearly completely ignores her, throws up a defensive barrier, and keeps working on teleporting the entire gang out of the Wolkenritter's barrier. This ALL WITHOUT THE USE OF A MAGICAL DEVICE. Vita had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">demolished Nanoha</a> and would have won if the others hadn't interfered just the episode before.
</li></ul></li><li> Alucard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, not because he can't be damaged (rather the opposite, really) but because his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> is so powerful that it makes him practically unkillable. He likely also doesn't because it's scary as hell for those attacking him with absolutely no clear actual permanent effect. When he begins employing anything approaching tactics (i.e. stopping to think in any way whatsoever), you can tell the fight is very serious.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Hidan is entirely immortal, and thus has almost no strategy or moves beyond "get opponent's blood for voodoo technique". Both his partner Kakuzu and eventual opponent Shikamaru tell him how stupid that is. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">entirely right.</a></span> Again, <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionalImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConditionalImmortality">Conditional Immortality</a> like with Alucard. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that, if he doesn't perform his ritual sacrifices, his immortality will eventually run out. No word on how long <em>that</em> takes, though.
</li><li> The series is otherwise an aversion, as it's shown that even with heavy use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Atlas Superpower</a>, there's a limit to the raw physical ability any person can normally achieve (as detailed in <a class="urllink" href="http://narutoforums.com/showthread.php?t=454470">this helpful essay<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). Thus, even insanely powerful ninja have to avoid simple things like kunai and explosives and the strongest techniques are the ones that make being hit nearly impossible.
<ul><li> Hidan DOES have to dodge or avoid certain things though, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his body parts can be severed, and he shows no ability to reattach them. After getting his head cut off, Kakuzu has to sew it back on. Since Kakuzu is capable of ripping out peoples' hearts and absorbing them with that sewing...it's debatable if Hidan would've been able to pull himself back together on his own. Though Hidan's mid-range attack methods suggest not.</span>
</li><li> Some ninja, like Orochimaru, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">still play the trope straight though.</a> In Orochimaru's case, he can simply regenerate after almost anything including a broken neck. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This also bites him in the ass, as he makes no effort to dodge a blade that he thought couldn't harm him, only for it to turn out to be a <em>spiritual</em> blade that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">sealed him in an endless illusion.</a></span>
</li><li> Orochimaru also plays it entirely straight when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he fights Naruto in the 4-Tailed Transformation. He makes very little effort to actually dodge attacks, though he does use a technique which allows him to create a "new" body in order to avoid certain attacks' effects after they've connected. It isn't until Kyuubi!Naruto uses the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">4 Tails</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Menacing Ball</a> that he puts forth a <em>serious </em> effort to defend himself, commenting on how it could kill even him in one shot. Said "serious effort" being to summon the <em>Triple</em> Rashomon Gate in the blast's path. A pair of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> had previously described a <em>single</em> Rashomon Gate as the "ultimate defense". All three gates were destroyed, but the blast was slowed enough for Orochimaru to avoid destruction.</span>

He will take 1 damage from any attack (except magic and exceptionally strong enemies), but he only starts with 8 HP, and doesn't get much better. The main problem with his is the fact that the farther in the game you get, the more magic the enemies cast on him and his term of "exceptionally strong" gets looser and looser.

Since in the game armor slows you down, if you put it on and it surpasses a certain weight threshold (that you can increase with certain items) you have less invincibility frames in your rolling. Because of this, and the fact that you can avoid almost any kind of damage by rolling in time, many people that are too confident of their skills and reaction times tend to use as little amount of armor as possible, or not use armor at all (Of course, at risk of dying even faster if they fail in the process, and since less armor gives you less Poise it also means you will get stunlocked by incoming attacks easier).

<ul><li> Probably the most well known real-life example of this trope would be during the "Rumble In The Jungle," the fight between George Foreman and Mohammed Ali in 1974. Foreman had knocked out almost every opponent within three rounds, which Ali capitalized on by taunting him and giving him the opportunity to take easy but ineffective body shots. Eventually, Foreman ran out of steam and Ali finished him. Ali had beaten one of the hardest punchers of all time by letting Foreman punch him until he could punch no more.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmor">full plate armour</a> came into vogue, it was largely proof against most of the infantry weapons of the day. Wearers generally had to cripple their opponents by crushing joints with warhammers or basically wrestle them to the ground and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">stab through the weak points</a> with a broad-bladed dagger or half-sword technique. Trying to kill a knight by swinging a sword at him was totally futile; he could ignore all your attacks and settle down to killing you in the most appropriate fashion. Note that this includes early firearms.
<ul><li> It was around the same time that two-handed swords became really popular, because a knight or man-at-arms simply didn't need a shield anymore. Fighting styles completely changed with plate armor because the entire kit functioned as one large, full-body shield.
</li><li> To reiterate, swinging your "standard" sword wouldn't faze a knight in armor, so you had to have the martial prowess and strength to wield weapons and techniques capable of overcoming his armor, or you had to have the strength and training to overpower him and kill him in a grapple...all of these are skills that a knight has in spades.
</li><li> Contrast its main predecessor, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">chainmail.</a> It was heavy, bulky, and yet fairly protective to wear, especially when backed with enough padding to absorb the impacts of weapon blows. Powerful piercing attacks from swords, lances, or arrows could penetrate mail to the detriment of its wearer.
</li><li> A lot of old suits of armor made knights have that funny pointed pot-bellied look. Unless a stab is perpendicular to the slope of the breastplate, it tends to deflect off to the side instead of puncturing, and naturally a conic form makes determining the angle to stab much harder in the heat of combat. Naturally, you rarely if ever see it in mass media, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfGlamorous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfGlamorous">Rule of Glamorous</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The modern counterpart of the armored knight is of course the battle tank. Early tanks did not have the armor to resist much more than machine-gun fire, but that alone made them useful complements to bomber teams and light machine-gunners when assaulting enemy strongpoints — the 'defence in depth' doctrine having made 'trench lines' obsolete by the time tanks saw minor use in 1917 (after one experimental use 1916). In 191718, the sight of rifle and machine-gun fire glancing harmlessly off a pair of tanks as they lay waste to enemy pillboxes and redoubts was common — at least until the Germans started putting artillery pieces into pillboxes and redoubts. From then until now, no long-lived (outside of peacetime) tanker has <em>ever</em> been under the illusion that they are invincible — "shoot first!" is their international, eternal motto.
<ul><li> Of course, as per the knight example, this goes both ways: not all tanks are built equally, and a round that would punch through a Leopard I <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">wouldn't even faze a Leopard II,</a></em> leading to many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiArmor">would-be tank-slayers armed with obsolete weaponry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">gasping in astonishment as their rockets do little more than blow out their tracks or destroy their radio antennae,</a> Consequently, no long-lived (outside of peacetime) soldier has <em>ever</em> considered an enemy tank 'harmless' unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">it's a burnt-out, gutted hulk with its turret half blown off.</a>
<ul><li> Evolution of tank armor has been cyclical. Early tanks were lighly protected, while armor grew thicker during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, the era when the Leopard I was conceived, armor became lighter again due to advances in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiArmor">Anti-Armor</a> weapons reducing the benefits of heavy armor. Composite armor of the 1970s made heavy armor useful again for a while, but the very latest generation of anti-tank weapons has rendered it irrelevant given that a) many can penetrate composite armor outright and b) many are programmed to strike vehicles from above, where their armor is weakest. Now tank survivability is conditional on 'reactive armor' (outfitting the outside of the tank with explosives) and point-defense systems (shooting the anti-tank rockets down in the split-second before they hit) — and, of course, shooting first.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the same vein as the tank, but going back even further, ironclad warships brought the same defensive powers to naval warfare, with cannonballs simply bouncing off their armour plates. Since they were armed with those same weapons, the first few duels between these ships were all draws. For a brief time, when two ironclads fought, neither ship could hope to harm one another. There was, in fact, a short period around that time when the idea that due to the ineffectiveness of cannons, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">''ramming'' would come back into fashion as a decisive naval tactic!</a> Of course, that was when black-powder cannons (frequently still muzzle-loaded) firing actual cannonballs were still <em>en vogue</em> — and naval artillery refused to remain stuck there long enough for the prediction to actually come true.
</li><li> This is at least partly the point of the Bando Monk system of self-defense where their goal if attacked is to dodge and parry until their attacker gives up in frustration. Then they wish him or her a nice day and go about their business. Yes, it's active defense, but the intention is to frustrate the attacker into submission.
<ul><li> On that note, there is a common theme among many martial arts schools where defensive moves and postures involve a minimal amount of effort. Instead of leaping dramatically to the side to dodge a punch, you use a very small movement that slightly redirects the blow and slightly moves your body out of the way. Tai Chi is famous for this form of defense.
</li></ul></li><li> People will often start off following all safety protocols and then after time, pay less and less heed to them. This comes from people relaxing because the dangers that the safety protocols prevent don't happen often. Then, disaster strikes and people get hurt.
<ul><li> This is why "drills" are common in most industries. By running workers over and over again through the proper procedures, they become instinctive actions, and the workers will (in theory) keep themselves safe without ever having to consciously think about the safety protocols.
</li><li> This is also the reason why, ironically, there are more traffic accidents and injuries on open, straight country roads than dangerous roads on mountains and cliffs (proportional to their distance): motorists let their guard down when they think a road is safe and will often speed up and lose focus, whereas when danger is obvious and right next to them, motorists tend to slow down and pay attention to all their surroundings.
</li><li> This is also why the car accidents men get into are generally worse, if less frequent, than the ones women do. Men are <em>slightly</em> better at spatial orientation, but they tend to overcompensate for this with reckless driving. That's why most female accidents are fender benders and most male accidents are far more serious.
</li></ul></li><li> Can also be somewhat true in real sparring and fighting situations by attacking overwhelmingly enough that the opponent goes entirely on the defensive. You don't have to defend yourself if the opponent is too busy ducking and dodging to fight back. Better hope your opponent is weak in defense, though, since attacking takes far more effort. In an unarmed striking fight, if you don't win before you tire out, you're at his mercy.
<ul><li> This counter-strategy is the entire point of the rope-a-dope defense (and similar ones) where you let someone tire themselves out from attacking. And then while they're exhausted, <em>you</em> unload on <em>them</em>. The problem is that if your opponent knows what he's doing, and is fighting aggressively enough, you won't be able defend against all of his blows. Attacking may be more exhausting than defending, but a well-performed attack will usually still break through via proper use of feigns, sheer speed, and the fact that once you take just one good hit, your reaction time goes to hell, making it harder to keep on defending. This is why defense in a close-combat situation is usually a temporary measure used to launch a counterattack from, rather than anything you want to keep on doing for an extended period.
</li></ul></li><li> Completely averted in sabre and foil fencing, where an attack <em>must</em> be stopped or avoided before a counterattack is considered valid. Were the swords sharp, failing to defend before counterattacking would result in punctures of various vital organs, especially the lungs. Épée, which is based on a duel to first blood with less-lethal weapons, is an exception.
<ul><li> Played with by some Medieval- and Renaissance-era Western martial arts and Olympic fencing, such as the Liechtenauer tradition of German longsword fight, which advocate combining attack and defense in the same movements. The ultimate goal is to defend yourself in such a way that your defense also attacks the opponent, and to launch attacks that aren't easily countered. Since one good blow generally ended a fight in swordplay, the best defense was one that killed the opponent and prevented him from attacking again. Swordsmen got very good at this - the sign of an experienced swordsman was an explosive counterattack that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackRetreatRetreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackRetreatRetreat">immediately caused the opponent to be able to do nothing but defend himself,</a> and keep being forced to defend himself over and over until he failed to do so. Beginners <em>begin</em> by learning parry and reposte as separate moves, but soon learn to combine them.
