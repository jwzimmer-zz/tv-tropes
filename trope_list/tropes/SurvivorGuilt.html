<ul><li> Superman has been accused of constantly doing good works partly because he feels guilty for being the last survivor of his entire planet. The extent of this varies on the character's portrayal. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Pre Crisis</a> Superman left Krypton as a toddler and had total recall, so he could remember his childhood home very clearly and always felt horrible about what happened to it.

This was later retconned.

The infection gives Superman, among other things, a deadly high fever, and causes him to hallucinate the dead biosphere of Krypton, haunting him for having survived while everything else died. Thankfully, Swamp Thing finds him, and helps him break through the fever and sickness, waking up on the other side with no memory of the encounter.

</li><li> Most of the characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em> have varying degrees of this.
<ul><li> Part of Rick's is because he and Carl ran away from The Governor's assault on the jail after he saw Lori murdered.
</li><li> Andrea has it because her former lover Dale is dead and she never told him that she'd fallen in love with him.
</li></ul></li><li> Many of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a> suffer from this, to varying degrees:
<ul><li> Nico Minoru used to have survivor's guilt over the death of former leader Alex Wilder (who was also her boyfriend), but since he brought about his own death by betraying the team, that's probably faded by now.
</li><li> Chase Stein spent years haunted by the death of his girlfriend Gertrude Yorkes, who died in order to save him from being killed by Geoffrey Wilder, which drove him to several attempts to resurrect her, the most recent of which finally took.
</li><li> Karolina Dean feels guilt for her beloved Xavin taking her place in order to answer for the crimes committed by Karolina's parents.
</li><li> Presumably, Victor Mancha also feels survivor's guilt after watching his mom burn to death at the hands of his father, Ultron. In later years, he developed a drug addiction in order to cope, which led to renewed survivor's guilt after he accidentally killed his nephew Vin while high, to the point that he tells his brother Vision to just kill him so that he doesn't have to live with the guilt anymore.
</li><li> Of course, arguably the worst case is the survivor's guilt suffered by Klara Prast, who suffered at least three near-death experiences in her first year with the Runaways, including getting caught in a factory fire and getting buried beneath part of the Runaways' house, surviving only because Old Lace's body served as a cushion from the rubble.
</li><li> Played with in the 2017 series, in which Gert is resurrected and is appalled that her teammates "wasted" every last means of resurrection on her while so many other people they know have died and will never get another chance at life.

Fortunately with the destruction of the magical instrument, Harmony was able to revive his fellow Smurfs by playing music from his own trumpet.

He was the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">Flash</a> and super-speed hero in general, and that job has a high death rate in DC Comics, so he's outlived a lot of them. The most painful loss was Barry Allen, the second Flash, who had been his protege and a dear friend. (The third Flash, Wally West, was <em>also</em> believed dead at this point... and Jay would go on to lose more successors, even if some managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">come back</a>.

After that last death she winds up having to see a psychologist to help her with her feelings on it. While still strong and capable, she's portrayed as realistically emotionally-unstable throughout the book, which is a major reason Peter hides his identity from her at all costs. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She naturally lost it when Peter died in her arms, screaming "Not him too!"</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IronMan">Tony Stark</a> has been suffering this ever since his <em>origin story</em>.

In one of them Tony imagines a universe in which Yinsen was the one who escaped in the Iron Man suit while Tony was the one who died, and everything and everyone is better off because of it.

<ul><li> In the revived series, the Doctor's character gets darker due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">entire race</a> (apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">the Master</a>) being killed off in a devastating Time War. Guilt compounded by the fact that the Doctor themself dealt the final blow, as first indicated in the episode "Dalek":
<div class="indent"><strong>Doctor:</strong> Your race is dead! You all burned, all of you! Ten million ships on fire—the entire Dalek race, wiped out in one second! <br/><strong>Dalek:</strong> You lie! <br/><strong>Doctor:</strong> I watched it happen. I <em>made</em> it happen! <br/><strong>Dalek:</strong> You destroyed us?! <br/><strong>Doctor:</strong>...I had no choice.
</div></li><li> They didn't simply cause it. In "The End of Time", it becomes clear that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Doctor killed the Time Lords on purpose, to prevent them from destroying reality. In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>, this is obvious in retrospect: after the Doctor ended the Time War, legions of Daleks survived, but only one other Time Lord</span>.
</li><li> This trope is arguably the defining personality trait for the Ninth and Tenth Doctors, although Ten is a lot better at hiding it.In "The Waters of Mars", the Tenth Doctor finally snaps. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As he walks away from the Mars colony as it's being destroyed, knowing that it, being a fixed point in time, cannot be saved, he hears the screams of the perishing people in his headset. Eventually, it gets too much and the Doctor, utterly terrified of becoming the single survivor once again, turns back and, in a frenzy, tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">take control of the laws of time</a></span>.
</li><li> The bulk of this guilt fades following the 50th-anniversary special, "The Day of the Doctor" when the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors team up with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Doctor who fought in the Time War and successfully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedOutTime">Tricked Out Time</a> to <em>save</em> Gallifrey</span>. However, the issues caused by changing history render the "younger" Doctors unable to retain the memory of doing it. So the Ninth and Tenth Doctors still retain their Survivor Guilt and, even if they didn't, the Doctor is still a survivor of a war that killed off huge numbers of his own people long before he absconded with the Moment. The Time Lords were <em>losing</em>, after all.
</li><li> Even without the Time War and the Siege of Trenzalore, the Doctor has watched a lot of people die over the centuries, and has felt personally responsible for many of them.

Within the episode, Nightscream and Optimus discover an underground, organic cave within Cybertron that houses numerous fossilized animals. Optimus is overjoyed, as it implies that Cybertron was once an organic world. Nightscream, on the other hand, becomes enraged/heartbroken, commenting that there were enough fossils for the entire Maximal population to scan, which would have saved them from Megatron's takeover (Megatron's scanners cannot detect Cybertronians with beast modes).

<ul><li> The episode "Hereafter" features an interesting version. Superman is flung far into the future, where the Earth is a wasteland under a red sun. The sole surviving human is the immortal Vandal Savage, who reveals that he ended up destroying humanity in one of his plans for world domination. Guilty for what he did, he assists Supes in returning to his own time and stopping him.

When his ex-wife Loretta dies, it forms a rift between him and his wife because of <em>how</em> broken up he is over it. Eventually, he figures it must be survivor's guilt because he'd repeatedly survived what killed her: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Peter</a> destroying his house, which caused his bathtub to slide off the second floor and shatter.

<ul><li> A well-known characteristic of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, as noted above.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">Anne Frank</a> often wrote about having nightmares of her friends imprisoned in concentration camps while she felt safely hidden. Now consider that Frank's family did end up in those camps eventually. Now go a step further, and remember that her father survived, but she did not. Nor did anyone else that was in hiding with her. Nor any of their friends or family who didn't escape before the German occupation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> felt a strong connection to Anne Frank after reading her diary when it was published. They were only a month apart in age and lived less than 100km apart during the war. The diary even mentions in passing an incident of five men getting shot for resistance against the Nazis on the same day that one of Hepburn's uncles was shot for doing the same thing. She got to know Frank's father Otto after the war and he wanted her to play his daughter in the movie but she refused because she felt so guilty about what happened to Frank while she survived. However, later in life she used the book to help raise money for UNICEF, which was her great passion in life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeMilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeMilligan">Spike Milligan</a>, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow">The Goon Show</a></em> and a man described as the Godfather of British comedy fought in World War II with several of his co-stars. Let's just say that, from reading his war diaries, there was a very good reason his comedy shows were filled with colossal explosions which never hurt anyone in any lasting way...
</li><li> Family and loved ones of those who died of suicide.
<ul><li> And people who attempt suicide and survive may get a <em>very</em> twisted form of this, because either they couldn't even manage to <em>die</em> properly, they feel like they've been cheated out of relief, or they feel they "chickened out" and have now burdened their loved ones with financial and emotional stress; it is the exact thing they wanted to avoid.
</li></ul></li><li> Clint Hill, the Secret Service agent assigned to protect Jackie Kennedy, suffered this after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">JFK</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoShotJFK">assassination</a>. He revealed in an interview how much he regretted not moving a second faster and taking the third (and fatal) bullet himself.
</li><li> Before his rise to fame, actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TellySavalas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TellySavalas">Telly Savalas</a> worked as a lifeguard and never forgave himself for the drowning death of a man on his watch.
</li><li> The Arlington National Cemetery was created in the aftermath of the American Civil War, intentionally invoking this trope: it was built in the backyard of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. It wound up being a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultBackfire">Insult Backfire</a>, though. While Lee wouldve preferred not to have his property seized, he considered it an honor for it to be used as a final resting place for soldiers.
</li><li> Many of the survivors of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">Titanic</a></em> disaster would get this (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">in large part due to listening to the victims freeze to death</a>). But in particular, Bruce Ismay, owner of the White Star Line and was on the <em>RMS Titanic</em>, suffered a long term depression and blamed himself for what happened on the doomed vessel, being quoted as saying he felt he didn't deserve to live.
<ul><li> William Randolph Hearst (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateDumb">among others</a>) defamed him after the disaster by blaming him for the insufficient number of lifeboats (ignoring the fact that there wasn't a single ocean liner that <em>didn't</em> have an insufficient number of lifeboats in that day) and making him out to be a villain out for his own skin who was the first on the lifeboats, doing nothing to help rescue people, when in reality he actually assisted many people into the boats and only left on the very last lifeboat to actually get launched.
</li></ul></li><li> A woman came home to find her two teenaged daughters brutally attacked and raped, with the eldest already dead. Years later, after the killer had found religion as he waited on death row and wanted to atone for what he did, he asked to speak to both the mother and surviving sister. When the sister spoke, the one question she could ask was why <em>she</em> survived. Turns out that, as well as dealing with the obvious trauma, she was also suffering a massive case of survivor's guilt.
</li><li> This is often the case with genocide survivors, and is partly why, save for the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">The Holocaust</a> (basically the only one that got widespread recognition), you generally don't hear a lot about them from the survivors until fifty years later sometimes, if at all.
</li><li> Adam "DJ AM" Goldstein suffered from this after the September 2008 plane crash that killed everyone on board except for himself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blink182" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blink182">blink-182</a> drummer Travis Barker. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Sadly, it never got better for him as he died of a drug overdose only eleven months later.</a>

</li><li> In his autobiography and in a <em>Behind The Music</em> episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WaylonJennings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WaylonJennings">Waylon Jennings</a> relates that he was scheduled to be on the "Winter Dance Party" plane with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a>, as one of Holly's band members. However, Jennings <em>deliberately gave up his seat</em> to J.P. Richardson, better known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBigBopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBigBopper">The Big Bopper</a>, because Richardson was ill. Holly, who had chartered the plane for himself and the band, joked "Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up." Jennings joked back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes."</a> Tragically, the plane did crash, killing Holly and everyone else aboard. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret">Jennings was haunted by those words for the rest of his life.</a> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsOrTails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadsOrTails">coin flip</a> did occur, but between Holly's other band member Tommy Allsup and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens">Ritchie Valens</a>.
</li><li> Director <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RomanPolanski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RomanPolanski">Roman Polanski</a>'s mother was gassed by Nazis in 1939, and 30 years later in 1969, the Manson Family murdered his wife, actress Sharon Tate (and their unborn child), and their friends. Polanski blamed himself for her death, and his tragic life has been a major factor in the reluctance of many to condemn him for his self-confessed rape of a 13-year-old actress. Polanski is unable to enter the United States due to his guilty plea in the rape of the underaged girl, and remains sheltered in sympathetic countries, although still under Interpol surveillance.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UlyssesSGrant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> felt this since he was originally supposed to go with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> to Ford's Theatre the night he was shot, but bowed out at the last minute. Grant believed that he would have been able to stop John Wilkes Booth had he been there. At the funeral Grant wept profusely, and later stated unequivocally that Lincoln was the greatest man he'd ever known.
<ul><li> Tragically, Major Henry Rathbone, the man who ended up going with Lincoln to the theater that night, suffered even more from this. He heavily blamed himself for not being able to stop the assassination, and it resulted in a long downward spiral of mental instability. Eighteen years after Lincolns death, he killed his wife (who was also present at the assassination with him) and then attempted suicide before being placed in an asylum for the remainder of his life.
</li></ul></li><li> Author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgetJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgetJones">Helen Fielding</a> noted that she was on journalism trip when her group decided she shouldn't go into dangerous territory in the Middle East since she was very young and a woman. Her caravan's jeep ended up hitting a landmine and she can still be seen trying not to shake when talking about it.
</li><li> Sadly, schoolchildren who witness heavy and ruthless bullying in their school, may develop survivor guilt, especially if the victim is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a> in the end.
</li><li> True crime author Ann Rule wrote a book about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> Ted Bundy (she'd been friends with him during his Pacific Northwest slew of murders, though she didn't know what he was up to) titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStrangerBesideMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStrangerBesideMe">The Stranger Beside Me</a></em>. For years after publishing this book, she received letters from women certain that they had had a near-miss with Bundy (and Rule was sure that a good chunk of these stories were accurate), expressing this sentiment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> spent his life wracked with guilt over his stillborn twin brother Jesse. He confided to his friend Larry Gellar about it, wondering if maybe he'd absorbed more nutrients when they were in their mother's womb and lead to his brother starving to death. Elvis' mother tried to comfort her son and told him they would all be reunited in heaven.
</li><li> Many surviving members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LynyrdSkynyrd">Lynyrd Skynyrd</a> suffered this to varying degrees after the plane crash that killed three band members and a road manager, but it was particularly hard on guitarists Allen Collins and Gary Rossington, because both of them, sitting in middle seats, survived while the people on either side of them were killed.
</li><li> This is one of the few downsides to having pets; no matter how much you love your cats (or dogs or most other pets), you will probably outlive them. It doesn't help that one of the easiest ways of coping with losing them is getting another pet.... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescentIntoAddiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DescentIntoAddiction">who you will also likely outlive</a>.
