<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> anime:
<ul><li> Similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">live-action movie</a> before it, the anime expands on how DL-6 ruined Yogi's life, though not to the same extent as the film.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> with Edgeworth, who does not suffer from his in-game counterpart's fear of earthquakes since this version of DL-6 did not involve one.
</li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> with Adrian Andrews. In the game, she's one of the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woobie">Woobies</a> of the series, and being accused of the crime made her break down in court and begging for help in light of her dependency issues. In the anime, her issues were not present or not being forced to get exposed and she managed to be calm most of the time.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanoha"> Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookAdaptation">manga</a> continuity. Fans gave this version of Nanoha the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> of "Emoha". This is especially noticeable in the part after the movie's events where, in contrast to the anime where she's pleased with the outcome but somewhat worried about Fate, she believes in the movie manga that she failed to help anyone. At the beginning of their mock battle in the manga, Fate believes that since she caused Nanoha trouble, she doesn't deserve to be friends with her.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> anime had this happen on a few occasions:
<ul><li> Ed has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenMinuteRetirement">10-Minute Retirement</a> from being a State Alchemist after hearing about Nina's death and Tucker's execution <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which actually turned out to be a cover-up</span>.
</li><li> There's also the scene from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">the manga</a>, when Al thinks that Ed may have fabricated his entire personality when binding his soul to the armor. Originally, it only takes Winry telling him that the question Ed was scared to ask was whether Al hated him to bring him to his senses (that and hitting him on the head with a <em>wrench</em>). In the first anime, he parts ways with Ed but realizes the truth when helping a pair of Ishvalan refugee brothers.
</li><li> In the first anime, Ed and Al both tend to angst about their struggles a lot more overall. Edward has PTSD symptoms he mostly lacks in the manga.
</li><li> Roy has significantly more guilt and trauma in the first anime than in the manga, and it's portrayed much more explicitly. This could be partly due to him being the one who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> killed the Rockbell's</span> in this version, but he has PTSD flashbacks to other parts of his actions in Ishval throughout the series (see: "Fullmetal vs. Flame").
</li><li> There's also Rose, who was little more than an extra in the manga, who wound up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raped, kidnapped, and traumatized to the point of becoming mute.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> franchise in regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">Zelgadis's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">chimeric state</a>; despite being used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> ploy several times in the anime, he's actually less prudish in regards to his appearance, and <em>embraces</em> the awe and nicknames that he receives from strangers (i.e "The Heartless, Mystical Swordsman); if for nothing else, he gets upset when he's being used for a silly ploy (such as being used as an anchor.). In the original novels, he is far more sensitive about his appearance and not frivolous at all; a side-story featuring him emphasizes this angst in which he broods over the fact that he made friends who see beyond his appearance in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne">The Vision of Escaflowne</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> movie adaptation begins with Hitomi attempting suicide, and a huge part of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> involves overcoming her depression. In the series, she was fairly more balanced, with most of her issues stemming from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">romantic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron">conflicts</a> and lack of confidence.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em>, after Vash is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> forced to kill Legato</span> he immediately falls into a state of shock after being horrified at his actions. In the manga, he is able to get over this fairly quickly after remembering that he still needs to stop Knives who is threatening everyone on the planet Gunsmoke. On the other hand, in the anime Vash remains in this depressed state for over a month, even growing suicidal before Meryl and Milly are finally able to snap him back to normal. It's also notable that the anime actually did this scene <em>first</em> long before the manga one was published, but it is based on what the creator was planning to do for the manga.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> manga, Yugi's grandpa wasn't really kidnapped by Pegasus; his soul was instead sealed inside a videotape, and Yugi could talk with him through a camcorder whenever he liked. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">The anime</a> makes it a straight case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">Your Soul Is Mine</a>, and anime Yugi is appropriately angstier about the whole affair. Yugi's guilt and fear over almost killing Kaiba is also played up more, especially in the dub where it continues into his duel with Mai.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KotouraSan">Kotoura-san</a></em> anime does this by shifting the focus from Manabe to Haruka and adding in the very angsty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning">Downer Beginning</a>.
</li><li> The anime adaption of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilSurvivor2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DevilSurvivor2">Devil Survivor 2</a></em> does this to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">protagonist</a> (here called Hibiki Kuze) removing much of his literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a> attitude in the game and replacing it with this trope.
</li><li> Shauna in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild">Cheerful Child</a> who's always smiling and happy. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em> she's very sarcastic and bitter, likely because in this canon she watched a dear friend fall into depression and was unable to do anything for him.
</li><li> In the original game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SandsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SandsOfDestruction">Sands of Destruction</a></em>, Morte was a gleeful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">Mad Bomber</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> who was <em>incredibly</em> upbeat about the prospect of ending the world - in addition to solving the problem of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>, it would be just plain awesome to watch (never mind the fact that even she wouldn't survive). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnimeOfTheGame">The Anime of the Game</a> removed almost all of her excitability and replaced it with a grim determination, which, while perhaps more fitting with her goal, makes quite a jarring start to her character; it also added <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of her parents and younger brother</span> as an explanation for her desire to see the world ended. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SandsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SandsOfDestruction">manga</a>, which was released about a year later, attempts to blend the two, with Morte being gung-ho at the start of the story but revealed to be steadily sadder as it progresses, but changes the source of her angst: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's now The Planner, the incarnation of the celestial being responsible for deciding the parameters of the world each time it was reincarnated. Because she was mentally exhausted at the last incarnation, she wished for a world filled with talking animals but forgot to wish they would be friends with humanity, resulting in the deep-seated racism of the series. Yes, in the manga, Morte was the <strong>entire reason for the sorry state of the world</strong>. She was roughly aware of it when she was a child, claiming someone like herself wasn't supposed to be happy, but repressed it during her teen years, resulting in the bouncy character we met at the start; when she recovered all her memories, she was suitably shocked</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight">.hack//Legend of the Twilight</a></em> anime is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> adaptation of the manga and changed pretty much the entire storyline to make everything become more dramatic. For example, in the manga, the twin protagonists Shugo and Rena are just a pair of siblings playing games together. In the anime, their parents are divorced, and they're playing <em>The World</em> because it's the only way they can meet each other. In the manga, the characters embark on a light-hearted journey to reunite a friendly, though mischievous, A.I. to her mother. The anime somehow involves a hostile A.I. that threatens to destroy <em>The World</em>, and several people fell into a coma along the way.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> manga anthology <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RWBYOfficialMangaAnthology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RWBYOfficialMangaAnthology">Red Like Roses</a></em>, Ruby is a lot more emotional than in the cartoon. After she berates Cardin for teasing Weiss about her scar, she starts tearing up. When she's visiting her mother's grave she also starts sobbing (while in the show she's always kept herself together while visiting the gravestone).

Over the years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">the lighthearted stories of yesteryear</a> have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> more and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks">in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks">later</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheModernAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheModernAgeOfComicBooks">years</a>.
</li><li> One of the most notable examples of this is the case of Barry Allen, The Flash. Originally a humble do-gooder who was motivated to become a superhero mostly because he liked comics and had just gained superpowers, meaning superheroics was the next logical step (he was already a police forensic scientist, so he already had a sense of right-and-wrong and desire to help justice), later retcons when he was brought into the present era included giving him a new backstory of a murdered mother with his father being falsely accused and convicted of her murder. Notable is the fact that this was both <em>unneeded</em> (Barry, while a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a>, wasn't exactly without his angst as it was, what with the death of his first love Iris, and him killing his arch-enemy Professor Zoom (Iris' killer) in order to save his second love), <em>and justified</em> at the same time (the retcon was explained away as Zoom going back in time to mess with Barry's life, killing his mother to give him more misery).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AfterlifeWithArchie">Afterlife with Archie</a></em> plays a lot of its tropes more seriously than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">the source</a> and thus there's a lot more of this, along with any obligatory trauma from being set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>.

Amy also seems to know that if she stands up to her white bully, Amy will more than likely be accused as the aggressor because of her race.

Multiple characters get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> backstories when there was none.
<ul><li> In canon, there's no sign Pina has a particularly hard life, and even after being kidnapped by Riz, he's still pretty much fine. In this fic, aside from having a troubled home life due to a strained relationship with his father <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and finding the body of his mentally unstable mother after she killed herself when he was a child</span>, he seems to have gotten PTSD from being kidnapped by Riz to a degree where he has a panic attack when kissing a female bear and running through the campus in shock until he could find Bill.
</li><li> Bill in the manga is generally a guy whose biggest worry is the desire to be taken seriously and to perform his duties as club leader when Louis leaves that position to him, in this story, he has a lot of emotional baggage. His home life is a mess as he has a religious fundamentalist father that is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">physically and emotionally abusive towards him, a brother than ran away from home when Bill let it escape to their father that he was in love with his male, herbivore roommate, a promise to said brother on the night that he ran away that he'd never fall for a man, leading to internalized homophobia when he realized he was attracted to a man</span>. Furthermore, a lot of actions he got over in canon are now deeply haunting to him, specifically the fact he almost ate a baby chick if Pina hadn't stopped him and that he ate an old man's finger at the start of the story.
</li><li> Agata's backstory is relatively simple, he had too much pressure in his life from being a lion and ended up having a rebellious face that led him to become a member of the Shishigumi. In this story, we learn that through his interactions with his younger brother Hikaru that his mother was extremely abusive and that he ran away to get away from her.
</li><li> Els, who didn't have any dark secret revealed in the manga, is revealed to have serious anger management issues to the point of having medication for it. When they visit Pina, she admits to Bill that she was transferred to Cherryton after she attacked a bully of hers with a baseball bat.

<ul><li> Like in canon, Norman is an outcast because of his ability to see the dead but in this story, it appears that he has a much closer relationship with his family than at the beginning of the movie. His sister Courtney, in particular, is much kinder and closer to him in this story, where in the movie's beginning she was almost as dismissive of him as the rest of the town. Also his new friendship with other characters helped alleviate some of his angst.
</li><li> Like in canon, Mr. Prenderghast is an outcast in the community and estranged from his family, however his friendship with Stan Pines implies that he is not completely alone like he was in the movie.
</li><li> Gideon plays this straight. In <em>Gravity Falls</em>, he was well off and loved by the town before his villainous nature was revealed. Here, he's practically an outcast and is seen as a weirdo on the same level as Norman.
</li><li> Dipper and Mabel were simply staying with Stan over the summer. Here, their parents died before the start of the story and their Great Uncle was the only relative who could take them in.

In canon, after Geoff realized he was becoming a jerk, he apologized to Bridgette and they got back together. In this story Geoff is even worse off-camera, and, while trying to be understanding, Bridgette was at wit end. When she tried to talk to him, Geoff got angry and, after hours of yelling at her calling her a harlot and whore, he broke up with her, leaving her heartbroken. And the producer heard about the fight and reminded Bridgette of the terms of her contract. If she acts any differently towards Geoff during the aftermaths, they can sue her mother. So she's pretty much trapped in an abusive relationship.

<ul><li> In canon, Cody was a rich kid that grew up in the suburbs and went to private school. It was implied his parent neglected him when it was mentioned they forgot his birthday. But in this story, he went to private school and was a victim of bullying. More importantly, the implied neglect of his parents is outright stated.
</li><li> In canon, it was implied Heather had a strained relationship with her parents, with them implying they disliked having her around, though Heather mentioned she the closest to her mother. In this story, Heathers parents, in particular her mother, have cast a long shadow over their daughter that at least partially shows how she became the bratty Queen Bee from Total Dramas first season.
</li><li> Gwen's life went pretty much down the pooper after the events of Total Drama World Tour. Her relationship with Duncan caused a rift to develop between her and her family, which resulted in her mother kicking her out of her house when she turned 18. This was fueled in part by Gwen trying to avoid her mistake with Trent and ditching a great guy too soon because of a few rough edges. But as a result, she's entered an abusive relationship where she has little to no personal autonomy, at least partially by choice. The relationship has weakened Gwen's more noble features while adding to her preexisting negative ones.
</li><li> In canon, Sammy had suffered implied years of abuse from her sister, but in the show, she was quick to stand up to Amy. In this story, all the abuse mostly destroyed her self-esteem. Though Jasmine seems to be helping her slowly recover from that.

</li><li> Zig-zagged with Arcee. On one hand, she doesn't remember the war and isn't forced into serving as the Decepticons' access key to Omega Supreme. On the other hand, it's because she doesn't remember her past that she's part of the exiled Orion Crew and her inability to remember who she was causes her a lot of grief and frustration.

The film places much more emphasis on the values of courage, which is justifiable since Mrs. Brisby is a mouse.

In the original source however, he's arguably even more angsty. Aside from not realizing he was adopted, this version also emphasizes the fact that he and Rameses were raised as brothers and friends, giving them a tragic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Cain and Abel</a> dynamic not present in the Bible or other versions.

Cloud is also far more goofy in his original portrayal cross dressing, entering parades, and doing squats to counter motion sickness. <em>Advent Children</em>, however, throws said traits out the window in favor of making Cloud <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> guilt stricken over Aeirth's death and aloof to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> to point where <em>Vincent Valentine</em> has to tell Cloud to buck up.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePrincessAndTheFrog">The Princess and the Frog</a></em>, Tiana is a workaholic bordering on a nervous collapse because she feels that if she doesn't achieve her dream of owning her own restaurant, she will let down her dead father (who shared the same dream and, in fact, inspired her). She also seems aware of what her friends, family, and the town in general thinks of her devotion to her dream and it gets to her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rapunzel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rapunzel">Rapunzel</a></em>, while Rapunzel being kicked out of the tower isn't very pleasant, it still isn't emphasized as being the worst thing ever.

</li><li> In the fairy tale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em>, the Beast is certainly not happy with being cursed, but still is stable enough to be kind and gentlemanly towards Beauty. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeautyAndTheBeast">the Disney adaptation</a>, being cursed has caused the Beast to fall into a spiral of self-loathing and depression and has all but given up on everything by the time Belle shows up (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has said that if Belle hadn't come, the Beast would have lost his mind and turned into an animal entirely).

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WonderWomanBloodLines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WonderWomanBloodLines">Wonder Woman Blood Lines</a></em> Vanessa despised Wonder Woman from the start for stealing her mother's attention and affection and chose to undergo her transformation into villainy out of willful resentment.
</li><li> The 1982 Soviet adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland">Through the Looking-Glass</a></em>, though generally faithful to the original, does it to the White Knight scene. The more comic moments (such as the Knight constantly telling Alice about his inventions) are toned down, and instead of reciting a poem about an absurd old man sitting on a wall, he sings a sad song about how there are many animals in his forest but he doesn't have a jolly elephant cub. The premise is only slightly less absurd than in the original, but it's the delivery that makes it absolutely heart-wrenching. Several birds that the Knight and Alice meet on their way are shown weeping.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> films:
<ul><li> Aragorn reveals his inner conflict more often than in the books and is not convinced that he should return as king until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">last movie</a>. The DVD commentary for the film outright admits this was done as a way to give him a character-building arc, although it is easier to rationalize considering the opinion the film's Elves hold about the will of Men in general during the story... which also wasn't so prominent in the books.
</li><li> Faramir in the books was able to refuse the ring when Frodo offered it to him without a second thought. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers">the movie</a>, Faramir being tempted to take the ring like his brother was, but ultimately realizing that he had to let Frodo go, was the driving force behind his entire arc in the second movie. The Extended Edition of the second movie and further shown in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">third</a> indicates this has to do with his father Denethor's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a> playing up his emotional neglect and abuse of Faramir, which made Faramir far more vulnerable and eager to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheReturnOfTheKing">The Return of the King</a></em>, Gollum turns Frodo against Sam before ditching him at Shelob's lair, and Sam is left walking back home in tears after pleading with Frodo not to believe him. In the books, they merely get lost in Shelob's lair after Gollum abandons them.
</li><li> In the film, Bilbo breaks into tears when realizing the trouble he has caused Frodo by passing the Ring on to him. In the book, he merely slaps him on the back to cover his emotion. When Frodo pulls Sam from the river, he embraces him and bursts into tears because of Sam's loyalty in following him. In the book, he calls Sam a "dratted nuisance" before admitting he is glad Sam came after him. The difference between old-fashioned British stiff-upper-lip and Hollywood touchy-feely?
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LetMeIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LetMeIn">Let Me In</a></em> Owens life was much more miserable than his counterpart in the swedish novel or film. In the book he had an older friend who would hang out with him, while Owen had absoultely no friends. His parents were more involved with him,his mother while busy with work would spend time with him and had a loving relationship with him, While Owens mother was a self-pitying alcoholic who neglected him. Owens father doesnt appear in the film, only being involved in a phone call wheres its made clear he hasnt seen Owen in months, while his swedish counterpart would see him every weekend. The swedish bullies torment of Oskar consisted mainly of childish pranks and several of them were clearly being pressured into taking part of the bullying and did so very hesitatntly , While each american bully deeply enjoyed causing Owen as much pain and humiliation as possible and their torment of Owen consisted of brutal assaults.
</li><li> Thorin's background in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>. He seems reasonably content in the book and his reason for returning to Erebor mainly seems to be to regain the treasure. In the film, it's a source of great pain to him that his people lack their rightful home, and he also wants revenge for the deaths of his kin.
<ul><li> In the second film, Beorn's scenes are not a funny and lighthearted break from a desperate ordeal with goblins because Beorn isn't a cranky but reasonable force-of-nature-like person who has to be conned into sheltering the company for a couple of nights. Instead, he's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last of His Kind</a> escapee from Azog's gladiator pits who only helps the Dwarves because he hates Goblins more.
</li></ul></li><li> Peter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em> films, especially <em>Prince Caspian</em>, is far less confident and kingly than his book counterpart. <em>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</em> also adds sub-plots where Lucy worries a lot about her looks and the consequences of worrying about it, Edmund angsts about his time as a traitor to the White Witch, and Caspian has daddy issues. The first movie also gives Edmund the psychological excuse of being the sibling most affected by their father being off fighting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>; in the books, the war is pretty much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitzEvacuees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitzEvacuees">just a device to get them all to a big strange house in the countryside</a> and is barely if at all mentioned after the first page.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">X-Men Film Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> Zigzagged with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ProfessorX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ProfessorX">Professor X</a>. The films claim that he had a much harder time dealing with his mutant powers as a child. In the comics, Xavier's abilities came easily, and he had no trouble using them (even cheating during school). It wasn't until he was a young adult that he started developing problems, due to service in Korea. Also, his home life in the movies is much more stable, with no mention of Brian Xavier's death, his mother's marriage to Kurt Marko, or Charles' antagonistic relationship with his stepbrother Cain Marko. The film incarnation gains a happier childhood in exchange for a much worse adulthood.
</li><li> Played straight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Rogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Rogue">Rogue</a>. While the comic version of Rogue would sometimes angst about her powers, she was still generally written as a sassy and confident Southern bruiser. The cinematic Rogue, by contrast, was very shy, withdrawn and timid, and a much greater emphasis was placed on her fear of her own mutant ability. Over time, some of this characterization <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcanon">made its way into the comics as well</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> King Leonidas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeHundred">300</a></em>. Turns his wife into a major character and makes her the voice of reason and confidence.
</li><li> The eponymous hero in the epic poem <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beowulf">Beowulf</a></em> was a dude who slew monsters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beowulf1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beowulf1999">The 1999 film version</a> starring Christopher Lambert made the character a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrid</a> who is tormented by the idea of him turning completely non-human, and fights monsters because of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StuartLittle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StuartLittle">Stuart Little</a></em> was changed (understandably) so that Stuart was adopted instead of Mrs. Little actually giving birth to him, leaving George with disappointment about getting a mouse instead of the "real" brother he'd wanted and a bit of a complex about being overshadowed by the novelty of Stuart. In the book, George was a fairly minor character whose defining characteristic was being kind of a know-it-all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hook">Hook</a></em>, a movie sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em>, makes the grown-up Peter into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad">distant workaholic dad who has to learn that his kids are more important</a>.
<ul><li> Likewise PJ Hogan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> greatly expands upon Wendy's reasons for running away to Neverland. Not simply just afraid of growing up, Wendy is afraid of what growing up will actually mean - becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaid">Old Maid</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> and being unable to have her adventures. This is all for the sake of undergoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> as Wendy realises that she was only afraid of growing up because she was not ready for it. Meanwhile, Peter gets plenty of angst as well, not being able to understand the nature of his feelings for Wendy, as falling in love is a part of growing up which Peter refuses to do. The film even ends on a bittersweet note with the narrator describing Wendy's happy family as "the world he could never be a part of".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> gave Willy Wonka the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> of an overbearing dentist father who disapproved of his passion for chocolate. This has made him a socially awkward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> who distrusts families.
</li><li> Film adaptations of Bible stories will typically add this - for example, the book of Exodus never says that Moses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangelingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangelingFantasy">had no idea of his Hebrew heritage</a>. In fact, it implies the opposite, but most versions have his true heritage be a surprise, to up the angst. Other such examples are:
<ul><li> A film version of the Book/Life of the prophet Joel gives Joel a love interest who is killed (in front of him) by the oppressors, spurring Joel onto his passionate, even frenzied preaching.
</li><li> The story of Ruth, already an impressive one in and of itself, is given an extra punch by making Ruth a <em>priestess</em> of the Moab religion, rather than just a Moabitess, and therefore her conversion to Judaism is much more meaningful.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The Last Airbender</a></em>: Movie!Aang spends most of his time angsting over his job as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">Avatar</a> and being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">last airbender</a>. While Cartoon!Aang isn't a stranger to angst, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">The Pollyanna</a>. Also people are quick to notice that Movie!Sokka never cracks a single joke when he was known as the funny guy in the series.
<ul><li> The difference is jarring to fans, as one of the trademarks of Aang's character in the original series is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstWhatAngst">apparently-eternal optimism</a>, and the few times he truly fell into depression were: after realizing he really <em>is</em> the last Airbender (by discovering the remains of Monk Gyatso); had his oldest and closest friend stolen by sand-raiders; and effectively lost the war by allowing the Fire Nation to finally seize control of the Earth Kingdom (leaving only a small band of rebels, amounting to little more than a single battalion of soldiers). While Aang always has a subtle sense of melancholy and quiet moments in the original series, Movie! Aang is basically morose throughout the entire film, with nary a sign of the cartoon's optimism.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> in the movies is a lot more somber. Peter Parker was always as angsty as he was in the films but between the good he does have in his life and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFightLikeACow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFightLikeACow">snarky battle commentary</a> he's a fun character; not so in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy">Spider-Man Trilogy</a></em> where the angst is pretty much wall-to-wall.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> series makes it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Zig Zagged Trope</a>: He has more problems, adding the baggage of missing parents on top of Peter's responsibility and love interest woes. (Other versions tend to gloss over just <em>why</em> he's living with an aunt and uncle at the beginning. <em>This</em> Peter has to solve the mystery of his missing parents, who turn out to have been murdered for their role in the science that would eventually lead to radioactive spiders and genetically altered super villains.) However, it also returns Peter's snarkiness when fighting as Spidey, and we even see him and Gwen Stacy <em>enjoying being together</em> in a way we never saw with the always-strained Peter/MJ relationship in the original trilogy. Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gwen meets a fate similar to her comic counterpart</span> in the end.
</li><li> This trope is however <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted">inverted</a> for the Spidey of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">MCU</a>. While this Spidey clearly has his share of problems in this continuity, Uncle Ben's death doesn't weigh as heavily as his conscience as it does in other adaptations  or, if it's there, then he does a really good job of hiding it. He's also a lot more secure in himself as Spider-Man, even though he doesn't really think he's all that important as Peter Parker.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Goku</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonballEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonballEvolution">Dragonball Evolution</a></em> suffered this trope. In the movie, he has zero self-confidence and feels that he "can't get the girl", a far cry from his actual personality, where he had no worries in the world at all, and initially had trouble identifying what a girl was.
</li><li> Most of the angst in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> films comes directly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">the books</a>, but there are still some film-specific examples of this trope. In the book version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em>, the fact that Hermione bewitched her parents to forget about her is something which is briefly mentioned in passing. The movie actually shows it, creating a heart-breaking scene. In the sixth film, Slughorn is seen to harbor much guilt and sadness over the death of Lily Potter via an anecdote about a gift she once gave him. The films actually avert it more often than not:
<ul><li> In the first book, the time our heroes lose one hundred and fifty house points makes them despondent and hated by their classmates, but the movie just skips directly from them losing the points to their detention.
</li><li> The second movie greatly downplays Harry's angst about potentially being the Heir of Slytherin, although it gets a little more play in the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletedScene">Deleted Scenes</a>. The fourth movie doesn't explain Barty Crouch, Jr.'s angsty backstory and portrays him as a straightforward villain.
</li><li> In the fifth movie, Harry doesn't fly into frequent ALL CAPS rants of rage at his friends nor does he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageAgainstTheMentor">Rage Against the Mentor</a> with Dumbledore during the final scenes as in the book; the movie instead portrays his inner struggle throughout the plot as one of bleak isolation because of his tribulations rather than angry frustration from feeling like he's treated with kid gloves too often.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a></em>, Maya pretty quickly recovers from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mia's death</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">or at least is able to act as if she has.</a> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">the movie</a>, she is more upset and, at the end of her trial, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">screams at Red White and demands to know why he hurt her family so much.</span> Also, while the backstory of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yanni Yogi</span> was plenty tragic in the game, the movie actually <em>shows</em> him having to suffer through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being accused of murder, having Robert Hammond say to his face that he doesn't care if Yogi is innocent or not, being harassed by his neighbors, and coming home to find that his wife has committed suicide</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> Aurora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent">Maleficent</a></em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em>, Aurora becomes heartbroken when she learns her identity as the daughter of King Stefan and Queen Leah, meaning that she'll have to leave her simple life in the woods with her aunts and marry a prince, never able to meet up with the nice guy she met in the woods (of course, said guy turns out to be Phillip, her betrothed all along). In <em>Maleficent</em>, Aurora is told by her aunts about her curse (to fall into eternal sleep) and even about Maleficent, who cursed her. However, in this continuity, Aurora has grown to know Maleficent as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyGodmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyGodmother">Fairy Godmother</a>, and even planned on moving into the Faerie Moors with her when she turned sixteen. As a result, this film places more emphasis on how Aurora feels betrayed by the people she grew up seeing as her family while adding on the angst that any teenage girl would get when they learn they're essentially doomed to die.
</li><li> Though her hiding from others is not shown as much in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGamesMockingjayPart1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHungerGamesMockingjayPart1">The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1</a></em>, Katniss' concern for Gale, Prim, and especially Peeta is played <em>way</em> up in comparison to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">the book</a>. For example, when she gives her demands to Coin in exchange for being the Mockingjay, she does not include her demand that she be allowed to kill Snow personally, only concentrating on saving the victors (and keeping Buttercup). This is especially shown in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the mission to save the victors</span>. While in the book, she was concentrated wholly on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingTheFloor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingTheFloor">Finnick's revelations about Snow</a> and therefore developing an increasingly complex relation with him as a result in their friendship, the revelations are more or less in the background, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including the fact that Finnick was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> not even having him on screen at the time of the comment</span>, with her focused entirely on the screens involving the secondary purpose of the reveals.
</li><li> A rather minor case with Jack in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IntoTheWoods">film version</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/IntoTheWoods">Into the Woods</a></em>, who develops a bit of angst due to his mother's treatment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cinderella2015">Cinderella (2015)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Somewhat; Cinderella in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">the original film</a> took her step-family's abuse as stoically as possible, only breaking down when she's denied a chance to go to the ball. In this film, Ella is shown to be clearly affected by her mistreatment, well before the dress-tearing scene. Nonetheless, she tries to make the best with what she's got.
</li><li> Tremaine is given a more sympathetic, deeper personality, as opposed to her flat portrayal in earlier adaptations. Of course, she can hardly be considered anything but the villain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">just one with a better argument</a>. In something the original Lady Tremaine would never do, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedStepmother">Wicked Stepmother</a> is perfectly willing to let Cinderella marry her beloved prince... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">however, even then she has ulterior motives for doing so</a>.
</li><li> The prince <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByAdaptation">loses his father</a> in this version, although apart from the death scene itself, his mourning period is offscreen. Ella's grief at her own parents' deaths is also more vividly dealt with since the film opens with them both alive and highlights her bond with them, whereas in the animated version their deaths are only backstory.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em> adds more conflict for Dorothy at the beginning of the story than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em> has. While the book portrays Kansas as a drab place, Dorothy herself is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheerfulChild">Cheerful Child</a> and the cyclone that blows her to Oz occurs almost immediately. In the film, before the cyclone, she has to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouWereThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYouWereThere">witchy neighbor</a> Miss Gulch trying to have her dog Toto killed, feels ignored by her busy Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, and longs to escape to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantSong">"a place where there isn't any trouble."</a> This gives her more of a character arc than she has in the book, as her journey through Oz teaches her to appreciate her home and her aunt and uncle's love for her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWiz">The Wiz</a></em>, in comparison to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWiz">the play</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em>, depicts Dorothy as having a stronger fear of leaving the safety of her Aunt Em's house to venture into the outside world.
</li><li> Inverted in the first adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheChildrensHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheChildrensHour">The Children's Hour</a></em>, <em>These Three</em>. While still a somber tale about infidelity and power-dynamics, the climax is considerably less depressing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Martha's</span> love confession is quiet and calm instead of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a> from the play and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a></span>. The inversion is in large part due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHaysCode">The Hays Code</a> forcing the film-makers to make the film about a straight love triangle instead of a gay one, and censorship over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the suicidal themes.</span>
</li><li> Both played straight and inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnCarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnCarter">John Carter</a></em>. One the one hand, the movie version of Carter is somewhat more bitter over the outcome of the Civil War. On the other hand, the film skips over much of the angst that plagues his courtship of Dejah Thoris in the novel, there's no mention of his profound fear of the dark, and because the ending differs dramatically from the novel, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Carter is not teleported back to Earth in the middle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission">Suicide Mission</a> to restore Barsoom's atmosphere, and so he is not left to spend the rest of his years wondering if his wife and unborn child are still alive.</span>

The version in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PowerRangers2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PowerRangers2017">Power Rangers (2017)</a></em> are outcasts and/or dealing with personal demons and don't know each other before the movie. More specifically, Jason is a former football star who injured his knee while fleeing from the cops during a prank and crashing, and is under house arrest and lost his father's respect as a result; Kimberly's a former cheerleader who was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> who had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> after humiliating one of her friends</span>; Billy's autistic; Trini's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and questioning her sexuality</span>; and Zack is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who constantly skips class <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because he's taking care of his sick mother alone and is afraid of her dying while he's gone.</span> Even Zordon gets it - you'd think the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> nature of being trapped in another dimension and only able to communicate as a fuzzy graphic of your face is enough, but he was the leader of the previous Rangers, was there when they were betrayed and killed by one of their own, and is considerably less sure of himself and the Rangers, with whom he has a rockier relationship. Jason even notes at one point that though he hides it, he's as afraid as the teens are.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVisitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVisitation">The Visitation</a></em>, the book, Travis's wife died of cancer, which led to him feeling disillusioned about his ministry. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVisitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVisitation">The Visitation</a></em>, the movie, she was brutally murdered and her killer never found, which led to Travis becoming an atheist.

Much of Billy's angst comes from his history of parental abandonment and shifting foster families, making him less willing to open up to others. However, once he gets superpowers, he lightens up considerably and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends the movie as a much nicer person, going so far as to lead his foster family's pre-dinner ritual as a gesture of cooperation</span>.

Heck in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1942">original comics</a> the Amazons played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletCatch">bullets and bracelets</a> as a casual game, and getting shot at wouldn't have been a major surprise for any of them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteveTrevor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SteveTrevor">Steve Trevor</a> is far less sure of himself and far more battle worn in this incarnation than he starts out in any mainstream comic continuity.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>: While Ozymandias always had issues in the comics, the film ramps up his emotional broken-ness up several levels. He shows approximately three times the guilt, self-loathing and painful isolation of his comic book counterpart, even admitting that he "often [feels] stupid at being unable to relate to anybody". Furthermore, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">according to actor Matthew Goode</a>, Veidt was motivated to give away his inherited wealth out of shame for having parents who were Nazi sympathizers and war profiteers. While he still succeeds in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing millions in the name of world peace, just like his comic counterpart</span>, he seems genuinely horrified and remorseful for his actions, so much so that he lets an emotionally distraught Dan beat the crap out of him. It's rather telling that Ozymandias spends his last few minutes of screentime in a shell-shocked state, staring into space and looking about ready to fall over as the camera zooms out on him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnToOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnToOz">Return to Oz</a></em> Dorothy is mistaken for mentally ill by her aunt and uncle. She hasn't slept well since the tornado six months ago and she won't stop rambling about Oz. Dorothy ends up being sent to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuckooNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuckooNest">Cuckoo Nest</a> for help. The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> books contain no similar conflict. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry don't think much of Dorothy's fantasies of Oz and Dorothy doesn't have nightmares of Oz.
</li><li> In 1998 film <em>The New Adventures of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PippiLongstocking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PippiLongstocking">Pippi Longstocking</a></em>, the title character is a bit less fearless and more prone to sad moments than her literary counterpart, and eventually she's forced to live in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">Orphanage of Fear</a>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">breaks her optimistic spirit</a>, although thankfully she gets better (and gets out of the orphanage) by the end.

Here, he spent ten years of his childhood in almost total social isolation, and desperate for companionship, even though he masks that with his usual snarky attitude and playful charisma. Not to mention that, at least in the videogames, he has no backstory to speak of.

Mind you, a lot of this came from, or has <em>some</em> counterpart in, the comics. However, it happens to Barry in <em>very</em> rapid succession in the show; the comics character has been around since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> with the events these were based on spread out over his history.

While the comic book version of Rick has his fair share of angst and problems, the ones in the show stick with Rick for entire seasons and have a much larger effect on him and his group.
<ul><li> Rick takes Lori's death much harder in the show than in the comics, causing him to suffer a severe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a>. He seems to recover by Season 4.

There was no secret plan in the show because Rick was actually broken. He tried to convince his friends that this was the only way they could survive, by giving Negan what he wants. He regains the will to fight halfway through the season when he realizes that no matter how hard he tries, The Saviors will keep hurting his friends and Negan will still kill people.

In particular, their father's absence on military duty has estranged him from the children and brought the parents to the brink of divorce.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoys2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBoys2019">The Boys (2019)</a></em>: Inverted with Mother's Milk. His family situation is much better than in the comic, where he is divorced and his ex-wife is a drug addict, while his daughter is involved with many unsavory things.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PartyOfFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PartyOfFive">Party of Five</a></em>, the titular kids just had to contend with child services coming for them when their parents died.

Both characters worry more about their bosses potentially finding out about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFriendship">Forbidden Friendship</a> and they have heated arguments about Crowley wanting holy water from Aziraphale that could kill him and Aziraphale denying that a demon like Crowley could be his friend that aren't present in the book.
</li><li> Crowley's reaction to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finding Aziraphale's bookshop burning and thinking that Aziraphale perished in the fire</span>. In the book, he's distressed about this but is able to pull himself together enough to continue trying to stop Armageddon on his own. In the show, he gets so upset that he flies into a screaming rage, gives up completely on his plans to escape or stop Armageddon, and tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows">drown his sorrows</a> at a bar.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em>: The book was basically the story of John struggling to find a place in New London but later eventually leading to self-exile and suicide with his actions never causing any change. The series instead heads in the direction of his presence causing upheavals in society and citizens beginning to question the cost of the "utopia", along with a violent resistance/terrorist movement who rise up in the "Savage Lands".

<ul><li> One could argue that this trope was the basis for the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JesusChristSuperstar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JesusChristSuperstar">Jesus Christ Superstar</a></em>. In fact, it was precisely this reason that many people initially protested the film — because the all-powerful Christ isn't supposed to show feelings like the rest of the mortals, dammit (never mind that the Bible does have several entries in which he does just that).
</li><li> Early theatrical adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyTodd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/SweeneyTodd">Sweeney Todd</a></em> did this, converting the story's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> and radically changing his motives. In the original penny dreadful "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStringOfPearls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStringOfPearls">The String of Pearls</a>", he's simply a straight-up sociopath who kills his barbershop patrons out of pure greed for their valuables, whereas later plays and films depict his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> career as him taking revenge on the judge who destroyed his life and the society that did nothing to prevent it. Hence, although still evil in the extreme, he's at least marginally sympathetic for all that.

<ul><li> Tifa in the original game was largely dedicated to the cause of Avalanche with little issue on her side about being involved, though the lifestream event says she didn't want to be known as a violent person. In <em>Remake</em>, she's unsure of herself and often wonders if the group's actions are justifiable.
</li><li> In the original game, Barret and the others had no reason to question Tifa's resolve, but her reluctance to hurt innocents with Avalanche's bombing plan in the Remake causes Jessie to wonder whether Tifa is truly committed to their cause.

While the original portrayed them as typically stoic 90s heroes, the remake portrays the entire cast as far more emotional and struggling to come to terms with the horrors they experience. They give themselves pep talks to get through frightening experiences, curse and plead with the monsters attacking them and show their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer">relative inexperience</a> as a bunch of 20-somethings and a preteen trying to survive.

<ul><li> Minor character Robert Kendo in the original game was a goofy, yet somewhat helpful shopkeeper who is eaten by zombies after a few lines of dialogue. In the remake, he lashes out angrily at Leon and Ada. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is because the remake adds a wife and daughter to his backstory; the wife having been infected and been killed, while his daughter is slowly succumbing to the T-Virus.

It is implied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">he was killed</a> for doing so. This gave Casey his hatred for crime and an essential lifelong vendetta against the Purple Dragons. This backstory, however, was eventually adapted into the original Mirage comics.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0v0rm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0v0rm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0v0rm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is best seen in Casey's introduction in both versions: In the comics, he is introduced watching the aforementioned TV shows and cheering for the vigilantes while doing bicep curls with a dumbbell, whereas in the 2003 series, he is introduced in a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/QwXzvDwVDpc?t=136">similar manner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, except he is watching a news channel reporting about the Purple Dragons, with Casey's eyes burning with rage with a quick flashback of his childhood encounter with the street gang.</span>
