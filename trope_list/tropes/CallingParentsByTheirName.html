</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>, after finally meeting him face to face, Gon takes to calling his father by his name Ging. While he has a great deal of respect for Ging, he simply doesn't see him as a father-figure. To be fair, Ging doesn't see himself as such either.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StellviaOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StellviaOfTheUniverse">Stellvia of the Universe</a></em>, Shima Katase only ever refers to her mother as "Chi<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics">-chan</a>", indicating that there may be quite a bit of intergenerational rivalry going on. While it's never elaborated upon (it's not even clear whether Chi-chan is Shima's birth mother, or her father remarried), Shima's mom is a textbook example of a self-made woman, and Shima strives to be even more so, going as far as to effectively run away from home to enroll in a space university without telling her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Uryuu left home before he was fifteen and refuses to call his father by his first name. Ryuuken had anger issues with his own father, Souken, whom he felt was a thief; he also hated being a Quincy and could not tolerate Uryuu learning how to be one from Souken. Although Souken tried to tell Uryuu that Ryuuken had reasons for being so angry, Uryuu refused to listen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Souken stole Quincy technology from the Vandenreich when exiled for future use opposing Yhwach. When Yhwach murders Uryuu's mother with magical silver, Ryuuken forever destroys his desire to be a Quincy by secretly autopsying his own wife to collect the silver and forge the only weapon capable of neutralising Yhwach. Uryuu learns the truth when Ryuuken gives him the arrow to help Ichigo defeat Yhwach. The epilogue reveals Uryuu has reconciled with Ryuuken and is now a doctor at his father's hospital.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MatoiTheSacredSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MatoiTheSacredSlayer">Matoi the Sacred Slayer</a></em>, Matoi calls her father Shingo by his first name. She doesn't do it out of disrespect, but after living away from him for so long, she finds it hard to refer to him as her father.
</li><li> The titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a> only ever refers to his estranged father as "Hohenheim". Unlike his younger brother, who still calls him "Dad", Ed never forgave him for abandoning their family and leaving them alone to deal with the death of their mother. However, towards the end of the manga he finally calls him "Dad" after Hohenheim offers to give up his own life so Ed can bring back Al's body and soul (Ed refuses).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Vivio does this for her adoptive parents, but it's less a lack of respect and more for the sake of convenience since she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies">Has Two Mommies</a> and has to specify which one she's referring to in a conversation. It's also downplayed since she uses "mama" as an honorific and will occasionally just call Nanoha "mama" (Fate is exclusively "Fate-mama"). There is a single time where she just refers to them by name, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but it was due to her suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">Cloning Blues</a> and feeling unworthy of having parents.</span>
</li><li> Erio and Caro call Fate, who's technically their adoptive mother<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note04cc2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note04cc2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note04cc2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At least in Erio's case, Lindy is the actual legal guardian, since Fate was too young to play that role at the time</span>, and whom they otherwise treat as such, "Fate-san."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/VividStrike">ViVid Strike!</a></em>, Rinne briefly refers to her adoptive parents as "Dan-san and Lori-san" in her thoughts as she's considering parting ways with them and returning to the orphanage. It isn't out of disrespect, but a belief that she doesn't deserve to be with them, after brutally beating up her bullies and thus damaging her family's reputation.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PonyoOnTheCliffByTheSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PonyoOnTheCliffByTheSea">Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea</a></em> Sosuke addresses his mother as Lisa. (In the English Dub he calls her Mom instead.) This may be a reflection of Lisa as a free spirit or cool mom, as they seem to have a very strong bond.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FatherAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FatherAndSon">Father and Son</a></em>, Shou refers to his father, Youichi, as "You-san" instead of "Dad" or "Daddy". Other characters are shocked to learn this, which results in one of Shou's classmates telling him to not do that and one of Youichi's students feeling bad for him.
</li><li> Done in an interesting way for Chibiusa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> in regards to her future mother Usagi. She exclusively refers to her mother, Neo Queen Serenity, as mommy, but often refers to Usagi, Serenity's younger self, by her first name. Likely this is done since Usagi hasn't given birth to Chibiusa yet, the former is only about 14-15 when she first meets Chibiusa and as such it would probably be pretty strange to see a five year old girl calling her mommy, and finally the two often act more like squabbling sisters then mother and daughter. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Although at the end of <em>R</em> Chibiusa does call Usagi mommy before she returns to the future.</span>
</li><li> Hori from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Horimiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Horimiya">Horimiya</a></em> always refers to her father by name because she has absolutely zero respect for him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ComicGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ComicGirls">Comic Girls</a></em>, Kaos once refers to her father by his given name when talking to her editor, explaining that he gave her the idea that chopping wood is manly. It's unclear whether she makes a habit out of this, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: At the end of the series, Light addresses his late father by his full name while declaring that in a world so rotten, idealists like Soichiro who fight for justice and died trying to stop Kira will always be made out to be fools unless Light can continue to rule.
<div class="indent"><strong>Matsuda</strong>: What was it all for then? What about your dad? What the hell did he did for?! <br/><strong>Light</strong>: My dad? You mean Soichiro Yagami? That's right, Matsuda! In this world, all those earnest people like him who fight for justice... they always lose! You want a world where people like that are made to be fools?!
</div></li><li> Cana of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> for the most part refers to Gildarts by his given name, even though she spent a lot of the early part of the story trying to work up the courage to tell him that he was her father. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardDrinkingPartyGirl">Given</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadGirl">her personality</a> and the fact that once he learns the truth Gildarts turns into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParent">Amazingly Embarrassing Parent</a> who is constantly doting on her, it's not that surprising. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">During the Alvarez Empire arc, however, she does call him "Dad" when they're fighting together against August, and he seems on the verge of being killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">trying to protect her</a>, showing that she truly loves him as much as he loves her.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em>, Yui, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> who becomes Kirito and Asuna's daughter, does this with her parents after getting her memories back. It's partly because she's realized she is an artificial construct, and partly to show that she's gotten over her speech impediment that left her unable to properly pronounce their names.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>

The two of them love her and consider her their mother, although Nami once upsets her by denying that they're "really" family during an argument.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sanji</span> angrily calls his father, Vinsmoke Judge, by name before cutting ties with him. Since they'd been estranged for years and Judge had only returned to his son's life to force him into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> for political gain, it's clear that there is no love lost between them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> has a sibling example. Sasuke calls his older brother, Itachi, with his name ever since the Uchiha Clan Massacre. This might not sound unusual in the West, but calling your older siblings (especially those who are quite a bit older than you; Itachi is 5 years older than Sasuke) by their names in Japan is considered extremely rude, on par with calling your parents by their names.

</div></li><li> As shown in the flashback episode "Lisa's First Word", both Bart and Lisa referred to Homer by his first name as infants, building up to the heartwarming final scene where Maggie calls him "Daddy", though out of earshot. However, unlike Bart, Lisa refers to him solely as "Dad" now.
</li><li> In "How Lisa Got Her Marge Back", Marge is shocked when Lisa calls her "Marjorie" after a fight. Homer doesn't see what the big deal is since Bart always calls him by his first name, but Marge points out to him that it's only out of disrespect.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show has Stewie referring to his mother as "Lois". In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">earlier seasons</a> this was a sign of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">Enfante Terrible</a> nature and disdain for his mother. Ironically, he hates Peter less, but calls him by the even more insulting "fat man". When his adult self does call them "mom and dad" he immediately and violently 'corrects' himself with "It's Lois and the fat man!"
</li><li> In "Don't Make Me Over", it's a sign of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredSituationalNarcissism">Acquired Situational Narcissism</a> when Meg starts calling her mom "Lois"
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>. The girls almost always refer to Professor Utonium as "Professor" or "the Professor". However it's not a sign of any disrespect but more that they're not a "completely normal" family, as Professor is a scientist who accidentally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">created them</a> in his lab. If anything their relationship is quite positive.
</li><li> All throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>, Helga almost always refers to her parents by their first names — Bob and Miriam — as they often neglect her, and as such, she has little respect or emotional attachment to them; any instances where she does refer to them as "Dad" or "Mom' are incredibly rare. The times she does call her parents "Dad" or "Mom" are often times when her parents show care for her or show a skill, as a sign that she recognizes/respects it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em>, Otto and Reggie would occasionally call their dad by his name, Raymundo. This shows that he's a 'cool' laidback parent.
</li><li> A new family who moves to town in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> features a girl with classic "cool parents" who want her to call them by their first names. Hank of course is appalled.
</li><li> Carl from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AsToldByGinger">As Told by Ginger</a></em> often refers to his mom Lois as "Lola" and more rarely just "Lois". Carl is eccentric and unusual but it's not meant to be disrespectful. He has a less than pleasant relationship with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">absentee father</a> and refers to him as his given name.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>: When Finn first meets his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>, he calls him "Dad", but his father tells him to call him "Martin" instead, because he isn't comfortable being a father, right before he abandons him at the Citadel. The second time they meet, Finn calls him Martin most of the time, but uses "Dad" when he's saying something important or emotional.
</li><li> Spike in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> always calls Twilight by her name, even though he acknowledges that he was raised by her and sees her as a parent in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS8E24FatherKnowsBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS8E24FatherKnowsBeast">Father Knows Beast</a>". Then again, an episode in Season 9 clarifies that he was raised by Twilight's parents, not Twilight herself, and therefore their relationship is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">Like Brother and Sister</a>.
</li><li> Debbie does this in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWildThornberrys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWildThornberrys">The Wild Thornberrys</a></em> when she fills in for her mom to film their nature show. She starts acting like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimaDonnaDirector">Prima Donna Director</a> and calls her father by his first name, something Nigel doesn't catch till later.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DannyPhantom">Danny Phantom</a></em>, the title hero always calls his parents by their first names when in superhero form (as to not reveal his identity). One episode had Danny secretly gushing over how cool it is to call his dad by his first name.
</li><li> Zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BoJackHorseman">BoJack Horseman</a></em>. Hollyhock calls her biological father <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> BoJack</span> by his name after finding him. She explicitly states that she has no interest in forming a father-daughter bond with him (she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted">Happily Adopted</a> by seven dads) and is only hanging around him so she can find her birth mother. This turn out to be a subversion, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it turns out that he is not her father but rather her much-older half-brother from when their father had an affair with his younger maid, and thus Hollyhock calling BoJack by his name is appropriate.</span> However, when she actually does find her birth mother she refers to her as Henrietta while talking to BoJack, though more likely out of not knowing her well rather than not being interested in connecting, since she does mention that Henrietta seems nice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aspiring DJ Sour Cream has a somewhat strained relationship with his stepdad Yellowtail, who wants Sour Cream to follow in his footsteps and be a fisherman. Sour Cream even calls his dad by name a few times in "Drop Beat Dad", though after he helps salvage a rave that Sour Cream's biological father Marty bailed on, Sour Cream calls him "Yellowdad".
</li><li> As time goes on, Steven starts to view his deceased mother more and more as a role he has has to fulfill. In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E19StevenVsAmethyst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS3E19StevenVsAmethyst">Steven vs. Amethyst</a>", Steven refers to her as "Rose Quartz" instead of "Mom" as he usually does.
<div class="indent"><strong>Amethyst:</strong> I can't even be the one thing I'm supposed to be, you know? <br/><strong>Steven:</strong> Of course I do. I'm...not Rose Quartz.

Summer, Morty's sister, usually calls Rick "Grandpa" but will occasionally say his given name when angry or panicked. Since Summer idolises Rick and he doesn't take her on half as many dangerous or mentally-scarring adventures as Morty, this is to be expected.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Keith calls his mother Krolia by her name due to not meeting her until he was eighteen. The first time he calls her "Mom" (at least on-screen) is when they're about to be parted again in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/VoltronLegendaryDefenderS7E5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/VoltronLegendaryDefenderS7E5">The Ruins</a>". Naturally, it's quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>.</span>
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WinxClub">Winx Club</a></em> when Bloom, after finding her biological parents, starts calling her adoptive parents by their first names, Mike and Vanessa.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OKKOLetsBeHeroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></em> episode "Big Reveal", when K.O. learns the identity of his father, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laserblast (whom he believes to be dead),</span> he initially refers to him as "my daddy". Then he learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laserblast is actually still alive, and now living under the identity of Professor Venomous, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">a villain</a> who's acted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchnemesisDad">K.O.'s enemy</a> in prior episodes</span>. After this, he still refers to him as "my dad" occasionally when speaking to others or in his own inner thoughts, but when directly addressing him, always continues to call him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Professor Venomous" or just "Professor"</span>, showing that, in spite of his efforts to form a relationship with him, K.O. is still very wary of and not completely comfortable around him.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuessHowMuchILoveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuessHowMuchILoveYou">Guess How Much I Love You</a></em>, all of the characters refer to each by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullNameBasis">full names</a> and this includes Little Nutbrown Hare calling his father Big Nutbrown Hare.
</li><li> There's a couple of isolated incidents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> where Tenzin and Bumi refer to their father as 'Aang' and not 'Dad.' Given the context of the scenes (Tenzin is encouraging Avatar Korra by explaining that Aang also had trouble learning a particular type of bending due to it being the opposite of his personality and Bumi is angrily telling Tenzin that he'd be willing to carry on Aang's legacy too), it seems to be a conscious decision to separate Avatar Aang, the historical and political figure, from 'Dad,' the guy that was just their dad. When they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingToTheDead">talking "to" him</a>, they both address him as 'Dad.' Suyin does the same when she explains to Korra that Toph was a pretty hands-off mother, and Iroh also refers to his mother as "The Fire Lord" when he's telling Korra to seek her help.
</li><li> Bow of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoDaddies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoDaddies">Has Two Daddies</a>, and will sometimes refer to them by name—not as a sign of disrespect, just to clarify which one he's talking about.

<ul><li> When children choose to estrange themselves from their parents, often because of abuse, they sometimes will refer to them by first name, rather than "Mom" or "Dad."
<ul><li> This is not necessarily the only reason children call parents by their first names. Some parents allow their children to call them by their first names, just because the children feel more comfortable with doing so, often with the point that "Parents call children by their first names, so why shouldn't we do the same to them?"
</li></ul></li><li> It's not uncommon for teenagers who play high school sports to refer to their parents by their first name, at least in some situations. When they're at a large sporting event and yell, "Mom/Dad!", 25 other parents look at them, but if they say, "Jim!", they usually get the right person's attention.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> raised his children (Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet and Diva) to address him and his wife by name rather than "Mom" or "Dad".
