<ul><li> In one of the episodes of the anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BirdyTheMighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BirdyTheMighty">Birdy the Mighty</a></em>, the space-babe informs the hero that the slime based shapeshifting horror can only be hurt by a chemical weapon, specifically a surfactant. The hero promptly runs home and grabs a bottle of <em>dishsoap</em>.
</li><li> This is a common plot device in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em>, where Kyon repeatedly saves the world by doing very mundane things, like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kissing Haruhi</span>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">convincing her to put a disclaimer at the end of her movie saying that all of the characters and events are fictional</span>, or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">inviting the gang over to his house to do their summer homework</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em> manga has a flashback showing the epic battle between Nagi (The Thousand Master) and Evangeline (an incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass">Little Miss Badass</a> and vampire), who are two of the most powerful mages alive. After some suitably epic banter between the opponents, Nagi ends the battle before it even begins by catching Eva in a pit trap filled with onions and garlic. Game over.
<ul><li> Not to mention Chao's "secret weapon," which she didn't use in first place because she was afraid of the damage it could cause—a copy of her family tree. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Against her ancestor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> A powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire mage</a> is stopped by... a sprinkler system. At first, he scoffs at the lead for thinking that his fire summon could be put out with just a little water, and he's right about that—the real point was for the water to blur out the printed runes that were continuously allowing his fire to regenerate after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">being destroyed</a>. With that ability disabled, the rest is easy. He learns from this: Next time he uses laminated rune cards.
</li><li> GREMLIN's response to Touma's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> that's been kicking the ass of every mage he goes up against: They bring guns. Nothing supernatural about guns, so Touma's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> doesn't do anything against them, and without it he's just an ordinary guy.
</li></ul></li><li> This is why most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> hates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Emiya Kiritsugu.</a> Mages are typically very good at <em>magical</em> combat, but inexperienced in things like C-4 and sniper rifles. And that's <em>before</em> they discover the hard way that he also uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepletedPhlebotinumShells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepletedPhlebotinumShells">Origin Bullets</a> as more or less the ultimate form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Anti-Magic</a> at his disposal when the circumstances dictate so<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0i0fi');"><sup>explanation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0i0fi" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0i0fi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They're "simply" bullets that each contain a tiny portion of powderized bone made from two of his ribs, which imparts them with the mystical nature of his Origin — namely, to "sever" and then "bind" things in an imperfect manner. Applying the effect to a simple metal wire merely causes a reduction in its effectiveness as a wire; applying it to a mage's magical circuits, however, causes downright <em>catastrophic</em> consequences, as the circuits are completely ruined beyond any hope of repair, and the mage's body itself suffers massive, <em>fatal</em> damage from the backlash, with lots of extreme hemorrhaging and seizures. Even if they somehow survive it renders them powerless, their magic circuits unable to function anymore having been so thoroughly messed up.</span>.
</li><li> The Protodeviln of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross7">Macross 7</a></em> can only be harmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock">The Power of Rock</a>. One of their number, Gabil, gets a brainwave on how to deal with this: earplugs. This actually works for a while, but the humans just make their songs louder. Gabil then installs a noise canceller in his mech, which proves much more effective.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior">MegaMan NT Warrior</a></em> anime, the heroes get tricked into using a battle chip that corrupts Roll and turns her against MegaMan. After some time struggling to hold her off, their resident chip expert comes around asking what the commotion is about. When they ask what to do next, he just calmly says to put in any new battle chip and the corrupt one will pop out just like any other.
</li><li> Yusuke of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> is able to beat a demon using Botan as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanShield">Human Shield</a> by simply telling her to simply raise her arms, which made her slip out of the jacket the demon was holding her by and giving Yusuke an opening.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>: The bridge crew attempt to turn the Magi system off during Iruel's (a nano-virus-like angel) invasion of it. Iruel deactivates the command option before they attempt it. To solve the problem mundanely from there, they would need to physically destroy the computer - not a good option, considering the Magi controls all of NERV's operations, and the only person smart enough to reconstruct it is dead.
</li><li> The Paper Sisters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RODTheTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RODTheTV">R.O.D the TV</a></em> at one point go up against a villain who uses sound waves to disrupt their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperMaster">Paper Master</a> powers. Anita's solution? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheBookAtThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowTheBookAtThem">Throw a book at him</a>. A normal, unpowered, really heavy book. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mundangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mundangerous">It hits him in the face and knocks him right out.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> the whole point of the written part of the Chuunin Exam is for the student ninja to come up with elaborate and clever ways to cheat without getting caught, as a test of their information gathering skills. Sasuke is the only member of Team 7 to do it the intended way (he uses his Sharingan to copy every move someone else made). Naruto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">accidentally</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">abuses a loophole in the rules</a> (if you make it to the end of the test without being caught cheating and answer the final question- a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>- correctly, then you pass, regardless of whether or not your earlier answers were correct or if you even wrote down anything at all). Sakura doesn't cheat either- she's smart enough to be able to work out the solutions on her own without resorting to cheating.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YonaOfTheDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YonaOfTheDawn">Yona of the Dawn</a></em>, Shin-Ah is possessed and attacks his teammates using his paralysis ability. Zeno is immune to this ability and confronts him. How does the possessed Shin-Ah deal with him? He ties him up. More generally, Zeno's power only activate when he's injured to begin with. Tying him up or otherwise immobilizing him without hurting him is an <em>extremely</em> effective method of neutralizing him.

Not knowing who she is, but smitten and eager to impress the pretty girl asking him for help, he tears down the gate with brute force.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformers">Transformers Generation 1</a></em> comic had Scraplets - a sort of contagious "flesh-eating disease" which affects transformers. It was inevitably fatal, as well as completely uncurable, apart from some apocryphal records of a substance so rare that its very existence was doubted.

</li><li> It's mentioned repeatedly throughout the books that being being a wizard or being a witch is all about <em>not</em> using magic even though you could and instead relying on mundane solutions, because the magical solution will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">eventually come with a price tag</a>, and it'll be a bill you can't afford to pay.

One confrontation with a spell-proof ogre is resolved when Murphy cripples the ogre with a chainsaw and Harry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">drenches the ogre in gasoline and ignites it</a>. Harry is also one of the few White Council wizards outside of the Wardens willing to use firearms and frequently uses his staff or blasting rod as a cudgel.
</li><li> This was established as a key part of Harry's character as early as the second book, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoolMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoolMoon">Fool Moon</a></em>, when he'd run himself out of magic thanks to imprudent use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottledHeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottledHeroicResolve">magical amphetamines</a>, and still had a rather pissed-off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">lycanthrope</a> alpha male to deal with... so he pulled a .38 revolver and shot the guy in the knee. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">It didn't really work all that well</a>, seeing as lycanthropes have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, but it sure wiped the smug grin off the son of a bitch's face for a while.
</li><li> Speaking of Harry, special mention should go to how he handles a cult of wannabes who keep harassing him in the short story <em>Day Off</em>. Their leader challenges him to a magical duel, but Harry doesn't even bother. He just scares them off by pointing his gun at them instead.
<ul><li> In fact, mundane weaponry is the <em>accepted</em> way for wizards to kill if it ever must come to that, as killing humans with magic carries not just the obvious moral and legal ramifications but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">corrupts the soul</a>.

There's more complicated reasoning (basically involving disrupting concentration at a key moment), but even he points out that all of his magical ability is trumped by hitting a guy with a heavy stick.
</li><li> A major lesson that Harry often reiterates (especially to his apprentice, Molly) is that knowledge and basic common sense are a lot more important than magic. For instance, on one occasion when Molly suggests using a tracking spell, Harry points out that a simple phone call would work just as well.
<ul><li> Molly, in turn, manages to get the information the wizards need out of a tight-lipped PI not via any magical means, but by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBoobsYouMustObey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveBoobsYouMustObey">taking off her bra and going to talk to the guy in his air-conditioned car</a>.

He knew he'd get pounded in a straight fight (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not everyone can be Injun Joe, after all</span>), so instead he lured it into following him to the middle of nowhere in Nevada. Specifically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">a nuclear testing ground</a>.

</li><li> Also from <em>Turn Coat</em>, Dresden has Binder released from police custody so that he can follow him back to his more dangerous employers. However, he knows that Binder is smart enough to realize what he is doing, and that he will take precautions to ensure Dresden can't track him with magic. His solution? Hire a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggle">Muggle</a> Private Investigator to tail him as he leaves the building. Binder being a Wizard himself, he expects Dresden to come after him through magical means and the possibility that he would have him followed mundanely doesn't occur to him.

It is found out that lemon juice is a necessary ingredient. (The wizards do come back eventually, though.) It turns out, however, that magically created soapy lemon water works just as well, so by the end of the series the protagonists have what amounts to an instant wizard-melting spell.
<ul><li> In a climactic battle in <em>Calling on Dragons</em>, the wizard Antorell manages to escape from the magician Telemain by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowingYourSwordAlwaysWorks">throwing his sword at him</a>.

Alexander the Great is said to have solved the puzzle by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">cutting through the knot with his sword</a>. (Another account features Alexander merely removing the pin that held the knot and then untangling a little rope. A more thorough, yet no less mundane, solution suggests he fished out one or both ends of the rope and undid the knot correctly.)
</li><li> Heracles found a few mundane solutions to some of his Twelve Labors. The most mundane is needing to present Cerberus, the guardian beast of the Underworld. Rather than risk fighting Cerberus, Heracles just asked Hades "Hey, can I borrow Cerberus for a while?" Hades, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontFearTheReaper">a rather decent fellow</a>, replied something to the effect of "Sure, just bring him back when you're done." (Some versions of the myth state that Heracles still had to fight and subdue Cerberus even with Hades' permission, since Cerberus would not recognize Heracles as his master. But by asking permission first Heracles did not incur Hades' wrath on top of that.)
</li><li> According to Japanese urban legend, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowSmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowSmile">Kuchisake-onna</a> approaches and asks if you think she's pretty, answering no will get you slashed to pieces in a violent rage. Answering yes will get you slashed to pieces because the word she uses for "pretty" (kirei) is a near-homophone of a word meaning "to cut" (kire), and Japanese bogeymen are fueled by bad puns. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Giving a neutral answer like "you're so-so" (or asking her how she thinks YOU look) will confuse her into letting you go.</a> Kuchisake-onna can also be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetTooth">bribed with candy</a>.

Although this story is not actually true (after the Apollo 1 disaster, NASA decided pencils were too flammable for the high-oxygen atmosphere of a space capsule), it does point to a general principle of Russian engineering: smart people, dumb machine. That is, the critical point is to make sure that above all, the device <em>works</em> and to trust the user and maintenance crew with the rest; as a result, a Russian car (especially Soviet-era) might be overall a piece of garbage with about as much comfort as a gokart with no suspension, but it's guaranteed to start and run in the winter. (On the other hand, you do wind up paying a price in terms of safety and steeper learning curves, but the Soviets obviously thought the tradeoffs were worth it.)
<ul><li> Another reason pencils aren't used is because they work by transferring graphite onto other surfaces and require sharpening. Even if a mechanical pencil is used, graphite dust would still be floating around and risk coming into contact with circuitboards. Not a situation you ever want to happen.

Or, if the edition allows, you can get up in the mage's face and thump them whenever they start to cast a spell, disrupting their concentration with some well-timed violence.
</li><li> Magical disguises, whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LieToTheBeholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LieToTheBeholder">illusory</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Humanshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Humanshifting">polymorphic</a>, can be defeated by anything from a lowly <em>detect magic</em> to the high-level spell <em>true seeing</em>.

But this is less a matter of them being unable to approach you as it is them being too busy <em>laughing</em> to trouble you.
<ul><li> As well, the vampires race that has conquered all of Mexico is so vulnerable to running water and crosses that Super Soakers and <em>floodlights with crosses painted on them</em> (which create big cross-shaped shadows) are some of the best weapons against them.

That's why having a gun, sword or baseball bat with you always pays off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> reduced the time needed to cast some impressive spells, but keeping a normal weapon around was helpful.

</li><li> Due to the nature of the game, you have so many ways to complete an objective, some of them are so mundane and "obvious" that no one would think about it being possible. For example, in one mission, you have to get on a freighter, there is a ramp but you need a code to activate it. So you either need to hack the panel or find the databook (which may require hacking/lockpicking/searching).

<ul><li> This applies to most levels in the game.

The entire situation can be resolved by blocking the two entrances with vending machines.
<ul><li> Alternatively, stay hidden behind obstacles (the mercenaries won't actually bother to check behind them), and then when the elevator arrives, run for it and push the button.

While a few high-level spells exist specifically to shut down a spell-caster, with a relatively large chance of working, the easiest solution is to just hit them: the turn after being hit, they are completely unable to use anything magic or psionic (of course, this is also true for your characters).

That or you can use invincibility such as a Paladin's Hand of Protect (Conveniently castable on others, so simply asking one for help will usually work.) and drop from any height that reaches the requirement. Also, druids and rogues of sufficiently high level have a passive ability that lowers their fall damage (the druid one normally works only in cat form, but there's a glyph that'll let it work in all forms; the rogue one always works, and has a glyph that will boost its effect).

Many feature an elegant solution that can be ignored in favor of creative thinking and judicious use of Link's arsenal. Instead of using a gigantic rail to deliver remote bombs to the ceiling, a player can just shoot the ceiling with a bomb arrow. Rather than use carefully timed launching pads to shoot balls into targets, a player can simply carry the ball to the landing pad by using their ice power.

If it lands rear-end up, the player can either shoot the wires keeping it afloat... or just wait a few minutes and let the wires snap on their own. (They don't snap if the truck lands front-end up.)

<ul><li> The doll. One of the oldest and most universal toys ever conceived, it doesn't seem nearly as spectacular an innovation as discovering fire or crafting the stone ax, yet it revolutionized child care by giving young children something to safely try out social interactions with. Compare that to other social primates, in which subadult females can only practice infant care by stealing actual infants away from their mothers - a risky situation for baby and young female, alike - and youngsters of both sexes are smacked around by their elders if they commit a <em>faux pas</em>. Plus, learning to regard dolls as substitute-playmates gave the human imagination a jump-start.
</li><li> One recommended method for disarming a nuclear bomb is by shooting it. Nuclear weapons are very complex devices that need to go off perfectly to trigger a nuclear reaction, and triggering one of the blast plates even a split-second too early will prevent it from going nuclear.

Also note that if its hydrogen bomb (like almost everything is now a days) it will also have a secondary that probably go off and be able to level a city block or so. So yah stay back.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, one of the most tried and true methods of disarming a bomb or IED is to just make sure everyone is clear of the blast radius and then just setting it off. There is even specialized equipment for this: robots that set off the bombs (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">"This is some serious bullshit!"</a>) and dummy "vehicles" that drive over victim-initiated IEDs and trigger them before any actual vehicles reach them.

<ul><li> A fast food restaurant had an ATM inside their location. A group of men in dark blue coveralls came in, told management there was an issue with the ATM, and wheeled it on a hand truck. It wasn't until the store later called the bank to ask when a new ATM would be sent that they found out it was a robbery. No one paid enough attention to give a description, and the coveralls were unmarked.
</li><li> An urban legend has that a man would take money at a zoo parking lot. He worked every day for several decades, and everyone loved him. He announced his retirement and left. The zoo called the county to find out when they were going to send a new parking attendant. The county doesn't charge for parking there.
</li><li> A bank robber knew that he wouldn't have a lot of time to escape before police arrived, but he also knew a river was only a few minutes run away. So, he had stashed an inflatable raft there. All the police found was his discarded clothes and dozens of people drifting down the river.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Spaggiari">Albert Spaggiari<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> wanted to break in the vault of the Société Générale bank in Nice, a vault known for its door being so invulnerable it didn't even have alarms and professionals refused to hear his plan out as soon as he mentioned the target  but Spaggiari knew the vault was close to Nice's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer">Absurdly Spacious Sewer</a>, from which he and some friends of his dug a tunnel. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">For obvious reasons, bank vaults now have alarms and other defenses against tunnels</a>.
<ul><li> Later the police managed to arrest Spaggiari, who in prison wrote down the heist plan in a code. The judge called him to his office to decode it... and Spaggiari used the chance to jump out of the window and steal a bike. It is believed he died in Italy years later of throat cancer, the police never being able to track him down again.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> One urban legend in computer security goes as such: a computer security expert is very confident in his company's net security, and challenges a hacker friend of his to try to break into their server and steal a file. The hacker friend does so within ten minutes: by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JanitorImpersonationInfiltration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JanitorImpersonationInfiltration">dressing as a janitor,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill">walking right into the server room, physically stealing the actual server, and then walking out the door with it</a>. The lesson: you can have the most robust network security protocols in the world, but it won't mean anything if the attacker is able to get physical access to your computers.
</li><li> A problem many stores face is customers either stealing or simply not properly returning their shopping carts. Some stores starting installing a lock on their carts that locks them together and can only be undone by inserting a quarter. The quarter would be returned if a customer put the cart back in the right place; if they just left their cart in a random spot, the quarter would be gone. Suddenly, people started making sure to return their carts much more often.
