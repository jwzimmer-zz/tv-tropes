While doing so, they are caught by Shiho's mother. News of Shiho and Hiyori's relationship quickly spreads around at school, and Shiho and Hiyori become subject to slanderous gossip and ridicule. Shiho becomes devastated by the relentless teasing to the point where she and Hiyori come up with a plan to commit suicide so that they can be together forever. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thankfully, they don't go through with it</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoNoFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AoNoFlag">Ao no Flag</a></em>: With <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">half of the main characters</span> being not straight, and the already angsty nature of the manga, this was bound to happen.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mita Touma</span> is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredClosetGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmoredClosetGay">Armored Closet Gay</a> in love with his male best friend. He is terrified of him finding out and doesn't really know what to do with his feelings. Flashbacks imply that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLoveLastsForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnrequitedLoveLastsForever">this crush is not anything new and hasn't gone away in years</a>. Making matters worse, he believes that said friend <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is already dating a girl</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Itachi Masumi</span> attempts to get herself a boyfriend in an attempt to ignore her feelings for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her best friend Kuze</span>. She is heartbroken and devastated over breaking up with him, due to him being a good man that deserved better and implies she wonders whether her life would be easier if she was straight.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlFriends">Girl Friends</a></em> in particular loves this trope, with both characters frequently angsting about their feelings for the other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It does have a happy ending, though.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KashimashiGirlMeetsGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KashimashiGirlMeetsGirl">Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl</a></em> leans toward this in the beginning, but soon changes gears into a rather straightforward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>, despite all participants being girls. Also notable is the signs of transgender angst with Hazumu in episode/volume one before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> as well as in flashbacks.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FirstLoveSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FirstLoveSisters">First Love Sisters</a></em> manga averts this and has all girls accept their feelings for another girl as something fairly normal, with the focus on the romantic entanglements themselves.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SasamekiKoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SasamekiKoto">Sasameki Koto</a></em> this is largely averted at first since most girls seem to have no problems with their feelings for someone their own gender. Sure, Sumika is angsting heavily over her crush on her best friend Ushio, but that is because Ushio prefers cuter girls—and Sumika does not consider herself to be cute in the least. Later on, the largest amount of gayngst surprisingly comes from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ushio, when she finally faces up to her feelings for Sumika but is afraid of losing her as her best friend</span>.
</li><li> Ono from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AntiqueBakery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AntiqueBakery">Antique Bakery</a></em> is a special example. He holds feelings for Keiichiro who is isn't gay and had gone through a terrible experience with a male kidnapper as a child. One day, Ono confessed his feelings for him but was vehemently rejected. Even though they became friends roughly twenty years after that experience, Ono still loves him.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoBra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoBra">No Bra</a></em> manga, Masato is constantly torturing himself over his awakening feelings for his childhood friend, Yuki. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsettlingGenderReveal">Yuki looks and acts like a cute girl</a> <em>and</em> is obviously in love with Masato makes matters even more complicated. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Masato finally gives in to his feelings later on though</span>.
</li><li> Seems like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">characters named Shiori</a> usually bring the gayngst along with them:
<ul><li> Sei and Shiori's relationship in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MariaWatchesOverUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MariaWatchesOverUs">Maria Watches Over Us</a></em> has some elements of this. Of course, falling in love with someone who wants to become a nun is always asking for trouble.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanjukuJoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanjukuJoshi">Hanjuku Joshi</a></em>, closeted lesbian Ran harbors a deep unrequited love for her best friend Shiori, who is happily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">oblivious</a> to the other woman's pining and desire for her.
</li><li> Shiori in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> is the best frenemy of Juri, who is a closeted lesbian and has been in love with her since they were young. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfTheMixedMessage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfTheMixedMessage">Whether or not</a> Shiori is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">aware of this</a> just adds to Juri's misery. (Of course, it gets worse in the movie ... )
</li><li> There's a Shiori in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Octave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Octave">Octave</a></em> as well who goes through two rounds of gayngst: the first with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her girlfriend, who dumps her and returns to her former lover</span> and the second with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yukino</span>, to whom she offers a muddled confession mixed with love and lust, and is met with rejection. In the manga, this seems to be mostly averted at first, until the chapter in which Yukino visits her parents and decides to bring her girlfriend Setsuko along.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers">Sweet Blue Flowers</a></em>: Poor Fumi, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">losing two love interests in a row to other men</span>. She begs Akira not think of her as disgusting after she first comes out (confessing that she's dating another girl), and brings this up again after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haruka asks Fumi for advice over her sister possibly being lesbian, which finally drives Fumi to confess to Akira</span> at the end of volume 4. Ramped up considerably starting about the end of volume 3.

The only problem is that he feels that he can't accept this part of himself because his parents will disapprove. He's his parents' favorite and he feels that they, and everyone else, has very high expectations of him and that he can't disappoint them. This is coupled with the fact that he has a girlfriend, Rei, that he can't break up with because he can't bring himself to hurt her feelings like that.

</li><li> The 1961 Dirk Bogarde film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Victim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Victim">Victim</a></em> is positively overflowing with gayngst.
</li><li> Gayngst would account for much of Kirill's issues in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EasternPromises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EasternPromises">Eastern Promises</a></em>, along with being the son of a crime boss. He's a vicious, pitiful, self-loathing drunk, and very attached to Nikolai.
</li><li> The '90s gave us two British films about teenage boys coming to terms with their homosexuality: <em>Get Real</em> and <em>Beautiful Thing</em>.
<ul><li> Also <em>Wild Tigers I Have Known</em>, which is notable for making its gayngst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">completely surreal</a>.
</li><li> Before <em>Get Real</em> and <em>Beautiful Thing</em> there was <em>Two of Us</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AcrossTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AcrossTheUniverse">Across the Universe</a></em>, Prudence experiences this throughout the movie (the cover of "I Want To Hold Your Hand" practically screams this trope). In fact, she goes as far as to cover it up by getting herself a boyfriend who beats her, which then intertwines her into the lives of the other main characters.
</li><li> Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale's character) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VelvetGoldmine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VelvetGoldmine">Velvet Goldmine</a></em> goes through a lot of this.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AsGoodAsItGets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AsGoodAsItGets">As Good as It Gets</a></em>, when straight Melvin (Jack Nicholson) asks gay Simon (Greg Kinnear) after all the horrible things that have happened to him if he thinks his life would have been easier if he were straight, which causes Simon to ask back: "Do you consider <em>your</em> life easy?"
</li><li> Father Greg (Linus Roache) in the controversial <em>Priest</em> has this in spades.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bent">Bent</a></em> was about a gay man posing as a Jewish man learning to come out of the closet while in a concentration camp.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MerryChristmasMrLawrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MerryChristmasMrLawrence">Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</a></em> Yonoi suffers from this hard due to his (maybe) unrequited feelings for his prisoner Celliers. That they are both soldiers on opposing sides of World War Two makes this kind of justified though.
</li><li> In <em>Les roseaux sauvages</em> (<em>Wild Reeds</em>), set in 1962, a 17-year-old boy realizing he's gay says, "It's like a curse. I don't know why I'm landed with it." His female best friend tells him that a shoe salesman they know is living happily with his boyfriend.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaVieEnRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaVieEnRose">Ma Vie En Rose</a></em>, a 7-year-old trans girl with a crush on a boy is misunderstood at every turn, tries to butch it up, fails, feels miserable, and attempts suicide.
</li><li> In <em>Trevor</em>, a 13-year-old boy realizes he's gay, loses the friend he's in love with, is given The Talk by a priest at the request of his parents, is shunned by his schoolmates and tries to kill himself. In a meta sense however this trope was subverted; not only is there something of a happy ending for Trevor, but the film became the basis of <em>The Trevor Project</em>, a suicide prevention hotline for LGBT+ youth, giving people with their own gayngst to deal with a place to go to for help.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanB">Plan B</a></em> where Bruno and Pablo's friends turn out to be accepting of them having feelings for each other, but the two men still spend a good portion of the film's second half silently angsting about having fallen in love with each other. Bruno in particular, who originally planned for his seduction of Pablo to be just a stepping stone to get together with his ex-girlfriend Laura before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask">Becoming the Mask</a>, responds to Victor's query of "All of a sudden, you like guys?" by vomiting into a toilet and then gloomily telling Victor that he hopes this kind of feeling never happens to him.

When it was filmed in 1961, things were so repressed that they couldn't even utter the word "lesbian." And yet in the final scene, Karen visits Martha's grave and professes undying love to her... in a scarcely audible voice.
<div class="indent"><strong>Martha:</strong> I can't stand to have you touch me! I can't stand to have you look at me! Oh, it's all my fault! I've ruined your life and I've ruined my own. I swear I didn't know it. I didn't mean it. Oh, I feel so damn sick and dirty. I can't stand it anymore!

First she's raped by her friend, who was sure she felt attracted to him. Then he sabotages her relationship with the girl that she's actually into, who then rejects her when a photo of them kissing is distributed, saying Anne forced her.

</li><li> Detective Milo Sturgis from Jonathan Kellerman's <em>Alex Delaware</em> series had some of this, especially in the early books. Justified because they took place in the late '80s and he was the only openly gay detective on the force.

He's aware of being "different" but doesn't understand what that means, except that his father is determined to beat him into some ideal of manliness that he feels incapable of living up to. It isn't until he travels from a backwater keep to the capital of Valdemar that he becomes exposed to people who are openly homosexual. His self-awakening is correspondingly traumatic, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetKey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClosetKey">Closet Key</a> Tylendel becoming his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindlinkMates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindlinkMates">lifebound</a> as well as his first lover.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GivesLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GivesLight">Gives Light</a></em> is notable for averting this, which is probably because their society (Plains Shoshone) is historically open-minded about same-sex relationships. The main characters are both boys, but their relationship is treated like any other romance.
</li><li> The novel <em>Roses and Thorns: Beauty and the Beast Retold</em> by Chris Anne Wolfe both plays this straight and averts it. Angelique, the heroine, completely averts this trope when she discovers that she's being romanced by another woman. Drew, the figurative "beast" of the story, plays it very straight, especially in the area of self-loathing.

Kay is a more unusual case, as he sees nothing embarrassing about sex with men, but thinks feeling true love for one is "unnatural" (kind of unfortunate, considering that he's in love with Gerrard).

Especially since Rangi's country can be pretty conservative on the subject of homosexuality. Thankfully, it's subverted; Rangi laughs and points out that maybe Kyoshi shouldn't try to kiss her on her face, which is heavily bruised from a recent fight.
</li><li> Downplayed, but present in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RunningWithLions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RunningWithLions">Running With Lions</a></em>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Old Woman:</strong> Hi, what are you doing here? <br/><strong>Jenny:</strong> I'm celebrating Gay Pride, I guess. I don't know. <br/><strong>Old Woman:</strong> You mean "gay shame."

However, in one episode where a criminal commits a series of assaults on gay men, Julien very easily picks up on the perp's closeted self-loathing and taunts him with it.

<ul><li> Riley hit on his best friend, then threatened to beat him up if he ever told anybody. Then he started popping steroids, believing it would turn him straight. He eventually came <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">oot</a> almost by mistake by signing himself and Zane up for prom couple which was posted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsOnline">online</a>.
</li><li> Marco also has this in spades. At first, it's just usual Degrassi drama as he struggles with his sexuality, but it eventually encompasses his character almost entirely as his character arcs go from "How will he get through this problem?" to "How will he be discriminated against next?"
</li><li> Adam is straight but a trans boy and had his own fair amount of angst, especially when his parents tried to make him pretend to be "Gracie" when his grandmother visited.

<ul><li> Also averted many times, when he openly flirts with men and the worst he receives is a disgusted rejection and even managed to have a relationship/affair with the Duke of Crowborough. The only time he is threatened by a scandal is after attempting an unwanted kiss on the new footman Jimmy while he was sleeping, and even then, almost the whole household (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentBoss">Robert</a>) defends him.
</li><li> Later, in an attempt to "cure" himself, he spends a lot of money on a crackpot treatment involving electroshock therapy and drugs, which, naturally, do absolutely nothing but make him sick.

</li><li> Nathan in the British (original) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk">Queer as Folk</a></em> was having a bit of a teenage gayngst moment, when his best friend neatly deflated him: "I'm black! And I'm a girl. Try that for a week." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a>, himself gay, has gone on record about not being the biggest fan of this trope, arguing that it in some ways perpetuates gay shame both as something experienced by homosexuals and how it is viewed by non-homosexuals, and also because it can be a bit boring, cliched and stereotypical to watch and write. As such, while most of his works deal with homosexuality and are not entirely free of angst, the characters usually angst about things other than being homosexual.
</li><li> However, this trope plays a plot point in another RTD project. Although Captain Jack Harkness is absolutely devoid of any shame about his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">sexuality</a>, his boyfriend Angelo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TorchwoodMiracleDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TorchwoodMiracleDay">Torchwood: Miracle Day</a></em> suffers from deep-seated religious gayngst due to being raised Catholic in a small Italian town in the early 1900s. With terrible consequences for poor Jack...

The show being what it is, his status as "suicidal homosexual" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">played for laughs</a> for the remainder of the season.
</li><li> David from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder">Six Feet Under</a></em> has a really hard time with the fact that he is gay for almost the entire first season. It's mostly religious gayngst; David is a devout Episcopalian who believes (at least during most of the first season) that homosexuality is a sin and struggles intensely with reconciling his faith with being gay. The problem comes to a head about three quarters through the first season when David has to prepare the body of a young gay man who was beaten to death by a group of homophobes. During this particular episode, David does not have gayngst so much as a total emotional breakdown. After he breaks up with Keith for the first time, David's main story arc involves him slowly reconciling his homosexuality with his religious faith.
<ul><li> He slowly gets better throughout the series. Once he's reconciled his homosexuality and religious beliefs, he still angsts a little about coming out, but most of his anxiety comes from other sources, like the business and his various fights and break-ups with Keith (which is more about personality differences and communication problems between the two men rather than the fact they are both gay).
<ul><li> Also one of the few cases in which the gay character does get a happy ending. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He ultimately ends up with Keith, they adopt two boys, and the Fisher &amp; Sons company is implied to have gone to his children rather than Nate's daughters. Although the finale reveals that Keith dies many years before David, they spend over twenty years together raising their family before it happens.</span>
</li><li> Averted with Keith, who has virtually no gayngst, although he usually doesn't argue when his father refuses to acknowledge David as his life partner. This is probably more to do with a history of abuse than gayngst. Also, Keith states that one reason he was attracted to David was that Dave didn't typecast him as (to borrow Claire's words) the "big black sex cop" but instead treated him as an individual. Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GymBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GymBunny">Keith's appearance</a>, mannerisms, and job description, he'd likely have similar problems if his dating pool consisted primarily of white women.

<div class="indent"><strong>Calvin:</strong> How do you feel about a three-hour-long coming out story about a gay boy who is beaten by his preacher father and eventually commits suicide in the closet? <br/><strong>Ashley:</strong> ...sounds depressing. <br/><strong>Calvin:</strong> Exactly.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "In Heat", the killer is a guy whose father repeatedly tried to beat the gay out of him (he worked as a prison guard, so it's implied he was really, really brutal) and essentially drove him insane with self-hatred. He began killing gay tourists and stealing their identities, so he could live their seemingly carefree lives.
</li><li> Another episode "Broken". The killer had been sent to a "straight camp" where he was tortured and brainwashed similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>. He started killing men he slept with out of anger at his "vile urges", While also killing any women he "tried" to sleep with when they failed to arouse him like he felt they should.
</li></ul></li><li> Daffyd of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleBritain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleBritain">Little Britain</a></em> is a parody of this type, as he desperately wants to be perceived as gayngsty, constantly pointing out how horrible and lonely it is to be "the only gay in the village." Not only is his entire community very accepting but is full to the brim of gay people, including his own brother and his best friend. Daffyd ignores this in hopes of looking more miserable and alone. In fact, there are some hints that Daffyd is the only completely straight person in the village.

</li><li> Happens quite a bit to Kurt Hummel on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>. He is constantly bullied for his sexuality, his crush is straight, and at one point someone left a threatening phone call at his dad's business. Subtly, the father is initially uncomfortable, and in "Preggers", you can tell that the father tries punishment by removal on his son to cease his flamboyant dressing. However, this trope is also subverted when Kurt comes out to his macho, sports-loving, mechanic father, and he reveals that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransparentCloset">known since Kurt was three years old</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">("all [he] wanted for [his] birthday was a pair of sensible heels")</a> and doesn't love him any less for it. And throughout these gayngst plots, Chris Colfer's performance really makes it realistic and heartbreaking. Until the "Never Been Kissed" episode, Kurt has been bearing the bullying.
<ul><li> Things are looking up for Kurt Hummel. Though early Season Three has an episode about him realizing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> tendencies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">make him hard to believe as a leading man in a romance,</a> he is now in a stable, healthy, loving relationship with Blaine (who, himself, is cheerful, out and proud, and an overall aversion of this trope). Even Karofsky, the bully who picked on Kurt <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because of his insecurity with regard to his own sexuality, is now out of the closet and spends time in gay bars where he feels accepted. He's also contrite about the things that he once did to Kurt, apologizing and saying that that isn't who he is anymore.</span> On the other hand, poor Santana. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She gets forced out of the closet through a <em>political attack ad</em> (aimed at Sue), and just when she's finally made enough peace with her identity to decide to come out to her grandmother, her grandmother completely rejects her, telling her she'd have been better off keeping her identity as a lesbian a secret forever and disowning her.</span>
</li><li> In the episode "On My Way", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Karofsky</span> gets hit with gayngst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a> full-on. He is outed, gets bullied in his new school, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> tries to commit suicide as a result</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MADtv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MADtv">MADtv</a></em> did a skit with Will Sasso as a gay plumber who constantly angsts about how gay he is and accuses his customers of prejudice even though they don't care.
</li><li> Happens to a few gay characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em>, the notable ones being Todd Grimshaw who found out while his fiancée was pregnant. The stress from the whole situation caused her to have a miscarriage and Todd had to endure snide comments in the pub and shops, as well as David Platt (his fiancées brother) spray painting "Queer" on his front door.
<ul><li> Sophie Webster and Sian Power are a pair of recently outed lesbians. Claire Peacock outed them in front of the entire street and they ended up running away to get away from gossip. However, Sophie's family were actually quite supportive of them once they adjusted so they don't have too much besides the typical teenage angst.
</li><li> Sean Tully is a notable aversion, probably because the writers have realized that viewers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">won't actually feel sorry for him if anything bad happens to him</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> Willow Rosenberg is a pretty downplayed example since there is never really a big coming-out episode, and they probably skated around having the obligatory drama by having people know about it at the end of the season so most of it presumably takes place offscreen during the gap between seasons. Although Willow does feel the need to declare her sexuality every few episodes. Spike manages to bring out a little gayngst in Willow during "The Yoko Factor" but that fades quickly.
</li><li> Larry suffers a little before coming out of the closet but by the time it's mentioned again, he's out and quite happy about it.
</li><li> Tara probably fits this trope. She's rather insecure and worries that Willow will leave her for a guy. And she seems to have this a lot in the episode where her abusive family arrives in town, though a lot of it is metaphorical.

He tells a teenager that he has a lot of problems (this includes physical back issues, a penchant for unprescribed pain pills, and a murderer for a father) but being gay isn't one of them.
</li><li> A strange variation is found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Metrosexuality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Metrosexuality">Metrosexuality</a></em>. Most of the gay characters are angsty but not about being gay, rather they all eventually find out that, while there's nothing wrong with being queer and proud, it just doesn't guarantee that you'll be happy in the end.

<ul><li> His husband Kevin is shown as resentful of the police force in general because of this treatment.
</li></ul></li><li> Sal Romano of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen">Mad Men</a></em> has multiple sources of angst over his closet gayness. In the 1960s homosexuality is still illegal in much of the country, not really accepted anywhere, he works in a company and industry where men are expected to put a lot of notches on their bedposts, and he's married to a woman.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightAndDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightAndDay">Night and Day</a></em>, the writers manage to stretch this out over the entire eighteen months of the show with Mike Brake, a middle-aged married man with a son.

In the episode "Raising Hell", a memory demon requires everyone loses a memory of the person they love the most, making the memory visible to everyone for a few moments. When Alec's memory is of Jace, he freaks out so badly that the spell is wrecked, ruining their only lead at finding the Mortal Cup</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em>'s Kerry Weaver worked this pretty hard during her coming out storyline. Already a fiercely private person, she became so terrified of anyone finding out about her lesbian relationship with psychiatrist Kim Legaspi that she would barely even speak to the woman when they were at work, and when Kim was accused of sexual harassment, pretty much ditched her in order to keep their relationship secret. She did a similar thing with her next girlfriend, running and hiding to avoid being seen by her coworkers while out on a date, but the woman shows up at the hospital and forcibly kisses her in front of everyone, outing her, and putting an end to her timidity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sense8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sense8">Sense8</a></em> has an unusually sophisticated portrayal of this.
<ul><li> Lito at first doesn't seem to be conflicted about his sexuality at all, sharing a happy, if secret, relationship with his boyfriend and only being in the closet to be able to have an action movie lead career in conservative, Catholic Mexico. But when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> plot reasons force him to either let a friend suffer or let a blackmailer publicly out him,</span> it turns out that he does have some internalized homophobia, claiming "I'm not a fag!" when a man ever so gently tries hitting on him in semi-public. He needs a serious talk from a trans woman about "the violence we do to ourselves" to finally accept himself fully (and go kiss the guy who'd come on to him to prove it). Also, one gets the impression that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his boyfriend broke up with him not so much because he was going to let their friend marry an abusive man rather than risk getting outed, but because said boyfriend had been quietly suffering being hidden from the public like a dirty secret for years, and the incident finally made him realize that he couldn't bear that any longer.</span> In the second season, after getting outed, the couple suffers public disapproval and negative consequences to their professional careers.
</li><li> Nomi, the lesbian trans woman mentioned above, is in a very happy relationship and surrounds herself with the accepting San Francisco LGBT community, and she doesn't have any internalized trans- or homophobia (anymore - she explains to Lito that she did try very hard to be "normal" as a child / young teenager, until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an incident of brutally violent bullying from the boys at her swim club made her give up trying to be like them</span>). But her estranged mother completely refuses to accept her as a woman, she has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a very scary run-in with the medical establishment not treating her like a sane adult able to make her own decisions</span>, and the trans-excluding radical feminist "friends" of her girlfriend got pretty nasty towards her during a flashback scene.

<ul><li> In early episodes, David does have a line about fearing being the victim of a hate crime and Moira is surprised at the town's LGBT presence, but the reveal is that the town is tolerant.
</li><li> Later, as Patrick is seen coming to terms with being gay, he is the opposite of ashamed and is portrayed as happy he has figured out why his relationship with a woman never felt right. Later, when David discovers Patrick has not come out to his parents, the show gives the character a nuanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOutStory">Coming-Out Story</a> where he addresses his fears that his parents will see him differently. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They are accepting, loving and supportive, but still portrayed as processing the information and somewhat hurt that Patrick didn't tell them earlier.</span>

When he and Otto fall in love, he's terribly frightened, both for himself and for Otto. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Indeed, they are denounced; Martin comes <em>this</em> close to a sentence because he's a "repeat offender", and the department for the persecution of homosexuals tries to get Otto to accuse Martin of having seduced him.

</li><li> "Smalltown Boy" by Bronski Beat is about a young gay man being "pushed and kicked around" (bullied) by the homophobic populace in his town.

</li><li> "Jenny" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StudioKillers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StudioKillers">Studio Killers</a> is a peppy tune about an openly bisexual woman who has a crush on her best friend but can't tell her. It doesn't ever imply that the reason Cherry can't tell Jenny her feelings is due to worries about her sexuality, just normal worries about ruining a friendship. Lily Sevin's ballad cover of "Jenny" makes it sound more like Cherry has unrequited feelings towards her straight friend and is bemoaning it.

As the lyrics never mention being gay or the gender of the singers, it has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheMeaning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoverChangesTheMeaning">covered many times</a> to fit just about any "taboo" relationship, such as Len and Ren's cover having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">twincest</a> themes.

I(Love) is sung from the perspective of her girlfriend, who's fully aware of Luka's internal conflict despite her attempts at hiding it. GUMI acknowledges that their relationship was little more than an experiment, but she's fallen in love with her and is trying to "save" Luka from a dead-end relationship with a man.

He claims that he's diminishing their friendship by looking at Kyousuke in those terms, and asks forgiveness from the god of friendship for being attracted to him. Though, oddly, Riki seems to be the only one bothered by this - none of the other characters ever seem concerned at all about saying ambiguously queer things (or overtly queer things, in Kurugaya's case), and while jokes abound, nobody ever acts like it'd be bad if Riki and Kyousuke dated.

On the heavier side we have Miyu, who works to keep her relationship with Matsuri completely secret until they can move in together because she worries her parents will force them apart, and Kiri, who freaks out when she first realizes that she has a crush on Tsukuyo because of what it means for her sexuality. And it doesn't help that after she confesses, Tsukuyo tells her that it's normal for girls to be close and she's probably just confused about her feelings. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Because Tsukuyo herself was once confessed to, only for the girl to take it back saying she realized she was wrong, leaving Tsukuyo unsure of herself ever since.</span> On the other end, we have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasa</span> who says that she got over the issue of having a crush on a girl very quickly to focus on the much bigger issue of having a crush on her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">friend</a>, and Youka, who didn't even seem to notice her feelings were gay until Yuna points that out, and even then, her first response is "But isn't this kind of love rock as well?!"
