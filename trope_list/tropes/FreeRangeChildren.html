They'll ride down to their friend's house on the other side of town and go to places that aren't anywhere close to their own house.

The 1980-81 "Atlanta Child Murders" by a serial killer helped the change immensely. Also, media fear tactics included FBI statistics on missing children <em>reports</em> — not on missing children <em>cases</em>. If Bobby stops off at Carol's house on his way home from school to play video games with her, and his mommy gets frantic and notifies police, it doesn't matter if Bobby shows up at home an hour later; if he does this four times in a year that's four missing children reports to the tune of zero missing child.</span> Before then, kids were commonly allowed much more latitude, particularly in the summer months, concerning what they did and where they went. While the freedom kids had to run about town still wasn't nearly as great as it tends to be in fiction (parents still needed to know where they were going, when they were going to be back, etc.), they were often allowed to at least take their bikes to local shopping centers, swimming pools, libraries, or woods. This was the particular case in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseKnitCommunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseKnitCommunity">Close-Knit Community</a> where other adults would notice and intervene in cases of danger.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Just like the games, being ten <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">in the anime</a> is seen as an appropriate age to be given an incredibly powerful monster to keep as a companion and to travel around a world inhabited by many species of such monsters. School is never mentioned whatsoever outside of Pokémon-based ones and even these seem to be optional. This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> in that traveling around the world is only allowed <em>because</em> the child is accompanied by a powerful creature that can protect them if things go wrong. The Hoenn seasons of the anime had May hate and fear Pokémon at first, but unable to fulfill her dream of traveling the world unless she received a Pokémon for her own protection. Meanwhile, her younger brother Max was only able to travel with her, Ash, and Brock because she agreed to have custody over him for the duration of the journey; being too young to have his own Pokémon, he was forced to go home when May decided that she wished to continue her travels alone at the end of <em>Advanced Generation</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has people are considered of age for journeys once they turn ten, though not all children will choose to travel like Ash does in the anime. The (albeit non-canon) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">novelization</a> by head writer of the original series, Takeshi Shudo, even explicitly mentioned that the legal age of adulthood is, indeed, 10, with all of the privileges and responsibilities that come with that. All that said,
</li><li> The manga, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>, also uses this trope. There it's all the more egregious due to how the world of <em>Adventures</em> is portrayed to be significantly more dangerous than most other Pokémon universes are shown to be. On top of this, the preteen-to-teenage Dex Holders are often seen taking on adult responsibilities like it's completely expected and normal for them, some even having or seriously considering full-on jobs and careers, ranging from stand-up comedians to self-run Pokémon talent agencies to <em>International Police agents</em>. One can reasonably believe that legal age of adulthood in the manga actually <em>is</em> about 13, if not 11 or 10, as preteens wandering about with no supervision is treated pretty much like as if they were high schoolers or full adults.
</li><li> Hareta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonDiamondAndPearlAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonDiamondAndPearlAdventure">Pokémon: Diamond and Pearl Adventure!</a></em> is not only allowed to go on a Pokémon adventure on his own, but he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">raised by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">Pokémon</a> in a forest with very minimum supervision from Professor Rowan.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SuperGals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SuperGals">Super Gals</a></em>: Sayo, about 11, is allowed to trail her big sister around the streets of Shibuya.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Chosen are 8 to 12-year-old kids who run around Tokyo with no supervision (their Digimon aside), unquestioned, as would be the case with many high-schoolers.
</li><li> This was likely part of the reason the ten-year-olds in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Tamers</a></em> got an age up in the dub. This seems to be the norm in Japan (see the real life section).
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstructions</a> of this trope — the Digital Worlds of each <em>were</em> filled with dangerous monsters that wanted to kill them and the kids often had problems adjusting to the level of maturity needed to survive, and in <em>Tamers</em> their parents generally were at least initially opposed to letting them go there. In fact, Takato's father, who is not quite as stubborn on this topic as his understandably concerned wife is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">briefly discusses this trope with her,</a> convincing her that it's ultimately their son's decision <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when the Tamers are preparing to head off to the Digital World to rescue Culumon and defeat the Devas</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonDataSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonDataSquad">Digimon Data Squad</a></em> subverts this with the three main characters being either young adults or teenagers. Marcus is a <em>street fighter</em>. The youngest person in the show that owns a Digimon is Keenan, and he grew up in the wilderness of the Digital World nearly on his own.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeoRanga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeoRanga">Neo Ranga</a></em>, the girls range from about 10 to 18 and live alone without adults of any kind.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>, Cream the Rabbit is allowed by her mother to accompany her friends on quests to save the universe, despite being only 6. She has Cheese with her, but still... Sonic and the others aren't much better, being all under 17 and Tails being as young as 8, but it's unknown where their parents even are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sakura runs errands all over town and even goes to Hong Kong with only her big brother Touya (who's 17 years old tops) to supervise. Her brother is aware of her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a></em> activities and worries about her but doesn't interfere.
</li><li> Tomoyo has a troupe of bodyguards much of the time, but when needed they are inexplicably absent.
</li><li> Sakura can also create a duplicate of herself to leave in her place, but her brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretKeeper">already knows</a> it's not her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba">Yotsuba&amp;!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yotsuba can run all over the neighborhood without anyone to watch her (though she <em>does</em> usually have either her dad or one of the neighbors in close proximity). She does get scolded when she runs off on her own. She just never really seems to learn her lesson. Thankfully her world seems to be super safe.
</li><li> It seems this concept was tried out in chapter 1 but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">dropped</a> because it made Mr. Koiwai seem neglectful rather than laid back and a bit forgetful. In the first chapter, she wanders around the neighborhood and Koiwai is confident she'll come back to the house when she gets hungry. However, after all the trouble she causes during that escapade he becomes more protective of her. The next time she wanders around unsupervised he does punish her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Deconstructed</a> in one chapter. At the fireworks festival, because Yotsuba hasn't realized the potential dangers of getting lost in a crowd after she runs off (the panel after being told not to let go of Koiwai's hand, naturally), Koiwai has Jumbo, Ena, and Miura hide to teach her a lesson.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> five seven-year-old children with a knack for wandering into murder scenes are allowed free rein over Tokyo. Two of them happen to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Older Than They Look</a> but the parents don't know that. Somewhat more understandable when you remember that Japan has a much lower crime rate than the USA. Also kinda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> arc when the Mouris, before separation, found the Kudos' <em>very</em> laissez-faire parenting a bit annoying. Indeed, the entire reason Shinichi ends up as Conan is that he curiously follows a shady-looking guy (whose companion he earlier noted had the eyes of a cold-blooded killer and is curiously nowhere to be seen) he thinks is up to something illegal. He's right, but it turns out the shady guy doesn't want anyone to find out and is perfectly willing to use violence to make sure it stays secret.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlyingWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FlyingWitch">Flying Witch</a></em> has an interesting exchange in episode 5. 9-year-old Chinatsu spots the cat Chito sneaking out, runs in and shouts to her mother that she's going out for a bit. When asked where she simply says "I don't know but I'm sure it's someplace amazing", and all her mother has to say is "watch for cars", at which point Chinatsu proceeds to follow Chito all around the town. And when she comes home covered in dirt from head to toe, her mother still asks nothing and just tells her to wash the dirt off before coming in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em>. Nanoha's parents practically let her join the enforcement branch of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">interdimensional</a> government at age 9. And the government branch seems to have no problems sending out a pair of children to deal with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a> that's already killed hundreds of trained soldiers, which is guarded by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Lady of War</a> with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlamingSword">flaming</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">chain sword</a></em>, among other things. For backup, they get another 9-year-old. Granted, said children are the biggest guns in the dimension.

The protagonists are allowed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship">hang around</a> two adults whom their parents don't know, and even <em>sleep over at their house</em>.

This includes a three-day bike ride to Kyoto on their own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> This was generally averted due to all of the pre-teen ninja being assigned an adult supervisor. The Sasuke Retrieval Arc was the only canon departure from this. With all the adult ninja being assigned to other missions, none of the members of the retrieval team were older than fourteen. This trope also extends to the Sand siblings who came to their rescue, as there is no evidence their teacher was present.
</li><li> Played straight often during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> arcs where Naruto, usually accompanied by one or more of his friends, would head out on a mission of some sort. These mini-arcs tended to be lighter fare, but still involved the genin travelling several days from their homes with no supervision in the middle of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RollingGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RollingGirls">Rolling Girls</a></em> both plays this straight and averts it. Nozomi's mother is very worried about her and initially protests her daughter's plan to ride across Japan on a motorcycle, but gives in once her husband convinces her to give Nozomi some space. On the flip side, none of the other three protagonists' parents seem to have any issue with their daughters ditching school and going on a cross-country road trip.

The same can be said for all the other children who are encountered, as they are mainly seen without adults. Played with in that they rarely do this for enjoyment, but rather out of necessity.
</li><li> The characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SerialExperimentsLain">Serial Experiments Lain</a></em> live in a society where it's perfectly normal for fourteen-year-olds to visit an adult nightclub and hang out at night. This also applies to Taro and his friends, who are even younger. In this case, it's <em>supposed</em> to seem weird and creepy to the audience.

</li><li> The kids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Super8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Super8">Super 8</a></em>. Justified in that it's set in the 1970s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarrietTheSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarrietTheSpy">Harriet the Spy</a></em>: In the movie, the children are only 11, yet they wander aimlessly around town with little to no concern from their parents. The book may have been written in the '60s, but since the movie was clearly set in the '90s, it was a bit jarring to see.
</li><li> A big problem for the 2007 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeToTerabithia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BridgeToTerabithia">Bridge to Terabithia</a></em> film, which is set after 2000. Nowadays, the well-off city-born Burke parents would <strong>never</strong> have allowed Leslie (their only child and only ten) to go even near the rope or in the woods by herself (or even with Jess), <em>precisely</em> out of fear that something might happen, despite the natural tendency of country-born parents often letting their kids do exactly that, after of course teaching them how to do so safely (or not, it's pretty much Russian Roulette). As with the Harriet The Spy example above, the book was written in the seventies, where one could arguably see this happening, but the movie is clearly set in the year it was released.
<ul><li> It implied that Jess and Leslie snuck out to the woods without their parents knowing, and they somehow managed to keep their parents completely uninformed about their little adventures. Which is somewhat justified, since the Aarons are too busy watching over their other four children and considers Jess, their only son, to be capable to taking care of himself, whilst the Burkes, being from the city, are on the eccentric side and thinks Leslie is independent enough on her own despite her age. The trope still fits though.
</li></ul></li><li> The four junior high protagonists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CampNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CampNowhere">Camp Nowhere</a></em> are pretty free-range to begin with. That said, the concept is brought into full play once they set up their own phony summer camp and bring along several of their friends. The trope is also explored in detail—issues like boredom, homesickness, injuries, and brushes with the law crop up throughout.
</li><li> The three siblings in the French movie <em>Demi Tarif</em> were abandoned by their single mother (though she occasionally calls). They are between the ages of 11 and 8 and live alone, steal food, roam the streets, beg for money, and do anything they want as they live alone in a Paris apartment. They also try to hide the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorLivingAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorLivingAlone">they live alone</a>, which is difficult. The stress of living alone shows on all of them.
</li><li> Early silent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEvidenceOfTheFilm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEvidenceOfTheFilm">The Evidence of the Film</a></em> shows a kid who looks about seven working as a messenger boy, walking across town. The role was played by an 11-year-old girl. Justified in that in this time period, it was not only common but completely legal for kids to have actual paying jobs, some of which would have been far more dangerous of themselves than simply allowing the kid out to play.
</li><li> The kids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFloridaProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFloridaProject">The Florida Project</a></em> freely wander the Kissimmee strip area without supervision, with it not being until one major incident that one of the mothers take action.

In their case, they were in view of their parent's house but were still mostly unsupervised.
</li><li> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunWildRunFree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RunWildRunFree">Run Wild, Run Free</a></em>, Philip attends a clinic for emotionally disturbed children, but his mother stops taking him because she doesn't think he's making any progress. Philip can't attend a regular school, so for the rest of the movie he's free to spend all his time wandering the moors.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCandySnatchers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCandySnatchers">The Candy Snatchers</a></em>, mute toddler Sean's parents let him come and go as he pleases.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mario1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mario1984">Mario (1984)</a></em>, Mario's parents are so busy during the tourist season that no one is around to watch him except his older brother Simon. The other neighborhood boys are also allowed to spend hours playing in the hills with Mario and Simon.

Especially jarring considering the film takes place in a universe where giant monster attacks happen on a regular basis, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanX">preceding TV series</a> has an episode where two children, having wandered too far near a lake, nearly gets devoured by a giant water monster...

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeelingSorryForCelia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeelingSorryForCelia">Feeling Sorry for Celia</a></em> has a great version of this trope.

The mother, who had been worried but expressing it strangely for a good part of the book, is instantly put at ease when she's told that her daughter is just with a traveling circus, saying "Oh, the circus! Why didn't we think of that earlier?" Another example from the same book is when a younger Celia and her best friend were planning on building a treehouse. Her mother is absolutely fine with the idea, no questions asked; however, the best friend's mother wants to know details. The two mothers get in an argument over the issue.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabySittersClub">The Baby-Sitters Club</a></em>, the eighth-graders are treated like high schoolers, while the sixth-graders are treated like young teens. They're allowed to run around New York City and Europe and take little kids sailing on the ocean, all without adult supervision. Eleven-year-old Jessi gets the starring roles in all her ballet productions and was left in charge of her 8-year-old sister and baby brother for a whole weekend.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFamousFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFamousFive">The Famous Five</a></em>: Certainly there was less helicopter parenting in 1950s Britain, but letting a group of 10- to 12-year-olds go on weeklong camping trips in various desolated areas with no supervision? They have the dog to take care of them, it's probably fine. The books do have them age up a couple of years. Julian was meant to be 15 or 16 at one point. One website worked out, from the pattern of summer/Easter/x-mas/half-term holidays they had, that by the end of the books they should all be in their early 20s.

Here are a band of Australian teenagers who roam around the countryside, armed to the teeth, participating in guerilla-style warfare, all without parental supervision. However, this is only because their parents are being held in detention centers after Australia was invaded.

<ul><li> The parents of the seven main kids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IT">IT</a></em> might as well be nonexistent, considering how they let their kids roam around unsupervised all day despite there being a killer preying on children loose in town. Of course, one of Pennywise/IT's powers seems to be making the townsfolk indifferent, maybe even accepting, of his evils, so it might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a>. Partially justified in-story for Bill Denborough's parents, whose grief over the death of his younger brother has made them both withdraw emotionally (even by the standards of the era).

As with <em>It</em>, above, it's largely justified: although the kids do have to come up with a cover story, it's clear that the adventure is only possible due to rampant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DysfunctionalFamily">familial dysfunction</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a> among the group, with two, Chris Chambers and Teddy Duchamp, explicitly having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive</a>, alcoholic fathers, and protagonist Gordie LaChance's parents in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcessiveMourning">Excessive Mourning</a> after the death of his older brother.
</li></ul></li><li> Elizabeth Enright's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MelendyQuartet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MelendyQuartet">Melendy Quartet</a> has the Melendy children running unsupervised all over New York City and the countryside. When Oliver (who's six) does it in imitation of the older ones, it's not with permission, and he gets into trouble. After that, the older kids decide that they'll accompany him to do whatever he wants on his Saturday because it's not fair that they have more freedom than he does.
</li><li> As does Betty Smith's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATreeGrowsInBrooklyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATreeGrowsInBrooklyn">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a></em>, which is based on her own childhood in that borough.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoxcarChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoxcarChildren">The Boxcar Children</a></em> series is essentially built on this trope. The children's independence is not only allowed but encouraged by their grandfather (who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByGrandparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByGrandparents">raises them</a>). Henry and Jessie, the two oldest, are only 14 and 12, but they usually seem more like high schoolers and act basically as parent figures to Violet and Benny, the two youngest — who are 10 and 6 but also act older. Throughout the series, they've done such varied things as camping out, exploring the Arizona desert, and even caving, all without a lick of supervision. This makes sense since the premise of the series is that they lived just fine in an abandoned boxcar for several months before learning their grandpa wasn't a jerk.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfTomSawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAdventuresOfTomSawyer">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a></em>. Huck gets a pass because he's an orphan (more or less), but in general the kids are allowed to go wherever they please, and the parents only get worried if the kid doesn't come home for a few days. A little girl's birthday party includes an afternoon of exploring the local caves, though it's well known that you could get lost and never find your way out.
</li></ul><ul><li> Lucinda Wyman and Tony Coppino in Ruth Sawyer's <em>Roller Skates.</em> Set in the 1890s, a policeman sees Lucinda doing pretty much as she pleases every day and thinks that New York isn't too big a city to turn a child loose in, "barring a few corners of it." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> One "corner" turns out to be a fancy hotel, and Lucinda, aged ten, finds an adult friend of hers who has been stabbed to death. The policeman never finds out about that.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRomanMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRomanMysteries">The Roman Mysteries</a></em> the four main characters border on this trope, and cross the line into it during several books.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceGirlFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceGirlFromTheFuture">Alice, Girl from the Future</a></em> books, the kids living in the 2070s and later often tend to be like this, especially on Earth and other civilized planets.
<ul><li> In the earlier and more serious stories it actually gets deconstructed: for example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneHundredYearsAhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneHundredYearsAhead">One Hundred Years Ahead</a></em>, Alice is left in a public zoo to work alone with a priceless thought-reading machine, and it's not too long before the latter gets stolen.
</li><li> In the later books, however, played perfectly straight. In <em>The War with Lilliputs</em>, Alice, Pashka, and Arkasha (all of them aged twelve) live fully by themselves in Arkasha's country house, and the grownups are okay with it because at least the kids stay on Earth and close to Moscow. In <em>Alice in Gusliar</em>, children are even allowed to make long-distance time travel on their own with the adults' full consent.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicTreehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicTreehouse">The Magic Treehouse</a></em> series averts the trope by having no time pass while the treehouse takes them anywhere or anytime in the world.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThirteenthTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThirteenthTale">The Thirteenth Tale</a></em>. Before they have a governess, Emmeline and Adeline go wherever they want to in the village because the Missus and John-the-dig are too busy taking care of a huge house and too old to keep up with them.
</li><li> Most of the Stark kids in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, since they have a tendency to be separated from their parents for long periods of time. Rickon, the youngest Stark at 3 years old, practically becomes feral along with his direwolf Shaggydog. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Deconstructed in that the only reason Bran and Rickon Stark can go anywhere is that their home is destroyed and they are both presumed dead. After her father's death, Arya ends up in the company of criminals and assassins.</span>
</li></ul><ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwallowsAndAmazons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwallowsAndAmazons">Swallows and Amazons</a></em> series has kids who are allowed to go sailing on their own, even though they can't all swim, from an Island on a lake where they're left alone for days on end. In one book, their 4-5-year-old sister comes along too. "Better drowned than Duffers. If not duffers, won't drown."
</li><li> Lyra in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em> series, due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">interesting</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">personal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScrewedUpFamily">circumstances</a> grows up with no parents in an Oxford college - that is to say, a place designed to educate adults. As a result, her education includes advanced physics but not the fact that the earth orbits the sun, and she's effectively feral, but as a result very independent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetSmart">Street Smart</a>, brave, and a chronic liar: traits that serve her well in her adventures. Justified with Angelica, Paolo, and many children in Citigazze. Adults can't go into Spectre-infested areas so the children, sometimes orphaned by the Spectres, go where they want. Sometimes, adults even send the children places to find food.
</li><li> Doris Burn's <em>Andrew Henry's Meadow</em> starts out with one kid, who likes to build complex contraptions, catching heat from the rest of his family for those contraptions getting in everyone's way. He retreats to a tranquil meadow and builds a little house for himself to build stuff all day in. Eventually other oppressed kids show up, and he builds houses for them. They spend hours at a time in their makeshift village until their parents start wondering where they keep running off to.
</li><li> The kids in most of Zilpha Keatley Snyder's books are this. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEgyptGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEgyptGame">The Egypt Game</a></em> it becomes a plot point because of the child murders in the area.
</li><li> Pretty much every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesPatterson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesPatterson">James Patterson</a> juvenile character exhibits this to some extent, but <em>I Funny</em>'s Jamie Grimm went to another town by himself for a comedy contest on his own - did we mention he's paraplegic? - and it's strongly implied he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">wheeled himself home</a> in the middle of the night.
</li><li> Books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones">Diana Wynne Jones</a> exhibit this to differing degrees, depending on the level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a> (a frequent trope in her books) and somewhat on the decade in which the book was written.
<ul><li> The children in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOgreDownstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOgreDownstairs">The Ogre Downstairs</a></em> (early 1970s) have attentive parents, but the youngest child (aged seven or so) is allowed to go to the library on her own in the daytime, though it's clear that none of the children is allowed out after dark.
</li><li> The girls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeOfTheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeOfTheGhost">The Time of the Ghost</a>,</em> set in the late '70s, live in a separate building from their parents, who don't check up on their whereabouts and don't notice when one of them goes missing (on purpose, to test them).
</li><li> Polly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FireAndHemlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FireAndHemlock">Fire and Hemlock</a></em> (1980s) ends up wandering alone around a city she doesn't know well, not knowing where she'll spend the night, because her divorced parents have both assumed that the other one is going to take care of her - but it's made clear that her parents are irresponsible, and her granny is appalled when she finds out.
</li><li> Later books tend to have a much elder sibling character (or similar) who can plausibly supervise, such as Vanessa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHomewardBounders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHomewardBounders">The Homeward Bounders</a></em> or Fifi the au pair in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArchersGoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArchersGoon">Archer's Goon</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeananMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeananMcGuire">Seanan McGuire</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OctoberDaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OctoberDaye">October Daye</a> novel <em>Ashes of Honor</em>, a human child had to live quite close to the school, since she walks, which surprises a young fae. On the other hand, the police only treat her as missing after 48 hours, which causes Toby to think about how they would never wait that long.
</li><li> The main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LockwoodAndCo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LockwoodAndCo"> Lockwood &amp; Co.</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanStroud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanStroud">Jonathan Stroud</a> run the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanormalInvestigation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanormalInvestigation">agency</a> by themselves, with no adult supervision.

However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Molly's parents</span> let her go anywhere she wants as long as her grades are good. Anywhere includes anywhere in the country.
</li><li> Katniss Everdeen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> at eleven years old roamed around town trying to sell her sister's baby clothes and ended up looking through garbage bins in the pouring rain and her mother didn't seem to notice she's gone. At the age of twelve Katniss (and Gale, who was fourteen) was running around in the woods trying to gather food and hunt which was not only potentially dangerous for kids that age in its own right, in Panem it's illegal and would have terrible consequences if the wrong person found out. Neither Katniss' nor Gale's mother seemed to mind at all.
<ul><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played with</a> for Katniss. She had to do the aforementioned things because her father died and her mother became so stricken with grief that she barely noticed her children anymore. Katniss resents her mother for life because she <em>wanted</em> her mother to scold her for doing such things and feed her, as mothers are ought to do. Basically, she was forced to become a Free-Range Child, even though she didn't want to.
</li><li> It's also justified for Gale. Though Hazelle is an infinitely better mother than Mrs. Everdeen, she has to take care of Gale's three younger siblings in a poor household and no husband (he died alongside Katniss' father), while her manual job only provides a meager income that's not sufficient to feed them all (even after Gale started helping her, he still had to take tesserae, which increased his chances of being Reaped). Plus, Gale is a competent hunter. It's not as if she had a choice.

(Tommi and Annika were just as square before they met Pippi.) Then again, what bad could happen to you when you accompany a girl who is stronger than most grown-ups, and who neither knows nor cares for and therefore doesn't really obey any laws of physics and therefore has the liberty to do anything she wants to?
</li><li> Sara-Kate's family situation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AfternoonOfTheElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AfternoonOfTheElves">Afternoon of the Elves</a></em> is at the darker end of this trope. She runs wild and does whatever she wants, apparently free of adult supervision <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because her mother is too sick and/or depressed to look after her, and Sara-Kate is trying to keep it a secret so she won't be taken away by CPS</span>.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BatPat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BatPat">Bat Pat</a></em>: in both the books and the animated adaption, the parents of the 3 main protagonists dont seem too concerned about their kids going out in the night or traveling all over town on their own.

This is justified by the fact that in this culture, children are expected to begin training for their adult vocation at the age of seven, so they expect a lot of discipline and maturity at a young age. On top of this, the main character is part of a poorer class where children have to start contributing to the household literally as soon as they can.

Just look at the name of the crew: The <em>Midnight</em> Society.

The teenage scoobies will be seen wandering around numerous points of town from their school building to a restricted research facility, during and after school hours. Buffy herself is used to climbing in and out of her bedroom window to hunt vampires at the local cemetery. It's explained in season 2 that each of the scoobies allow themselves the free time to fight evil and save the world by calling their respective parents and telling them they're staying at everyone else's house.

In one scene from season one, police go to Wallace's mother, fearing for his life. She doesn't know where he is, doesn't care, and doesn't care to be bothered by cops: he owes her $10, and she's "trying to get my drink on."

Once they'd seen their children <em>teleport</em>, the parents didn't see themselves as having much choice but to accept it.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> universe the parents aren't seen or even acknowledged unless they're relevant to the plot. A perfect example is the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTurbo">Power Rangers Turbo</a></em> where the team boards a rocket to go into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">space</a>. Justin stays behind to stay with his father. Nothing is mentioned about the other parents, so apparently they wouldn't miss their kids. Granted the Rangers are all high schoolers who spend most of their time in a popular high school hangout and they all have cars. Though the kids going off in space definitely counts (though they return to Earth in a matter of hours due to Artistic license on space travel)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce">Power Rangers Mystic Force</a>,</em> there's a two-parter where Vida becomes a vampire. It takes place over several days, naturally mostly at night. We never found out what the parents thought of their teens being out all night, and Vida being <em>nowhere</em> to be found all that time as far as the parents were concerned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoThunder">Power Rangers Dino Thunder</a>,</em> at least, the teens are known to be with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">their science teacher</a>, who used to be a Power Ranger himself and is used to that anyway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>, Carly, Sam, and Freddy are allowed to do pretty much anything they want since they usually lack actual parent supervision, though this is sometimes averted with Freddy's overbearing and overprotective mother.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoundTheTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoundTheTwist">Round the Twist</a></em>, the Twist kids regularly wander all about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyTown">Port Niranda</a> without adult supervision - from a new toxic waste-dump to the depths of the local unexplored forest, nowhere seems off-limits. To be fair, the two older Twist twins are 14.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, no one seems to be tasked with watching Carl, despite the worldwide zombie apocalypse. Carl wanders freely as the plot needs him to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyleXY">Kyle XY</a></em> tends to zigzag this a lot, varying between impromptu investigative adventures into the woods, hidden bunkers, or just the other side of Seattle, to take down evil megacorps, ferret out conspiracies, or even get a friend's car out of a towing lot to the kids getting grounded and forced to sneak around (and out of) the house. Lying to parents, covering for siblings, and generally skulking about is all over, especially if the quest involves going to a party or a bar. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that they are high-schoolers, some of them are even touring colleges they plan to attend, several of the kids have their own cars, and that Nicole trusts Kyle more than the other kids because he's a super-genius and not a regular, impulsive teenager. Also increasingly justified as the super-genius starts to change into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> actual superpowers</span> and the parents, though they legitimately try to keep an eye on their charges, are increasingly outgunned.
</li><li> This is in full effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em> with Mike and his friends in the first half of the season, and even moreso near the end. Stranger Danger hadn't yet kicked in in 1983, so this wouldn't have been unusual, especially in a small-town setting. Somewhat averted in <em>Stranger Things 2</em>, as the kids usually have the supervision of Hopper, Bob, Joyce, or Steve (who is himself only a teenager). Then again, Nancy and Jonathan do travel far enough away from Hawkins that they have to spend the night in a motel, and they're only teenagers. Also, Eleven travels to <em>Chicago</em> of all places during the season, although this does send Hopper into a frenzy, especially when he discovers she hitched a ride with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">"nice man in a truck"</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TiereBisUntersDach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TiereBisUntersDach">Tiere bis unters Dach</a></em>, the kids go pretty much anywhere they want in Waldau and the surrounding forests and farms. In one case, they even go over to a neighboring town to investigate a suspected pet-napping ring. The parents never seem to worry except when someone actually ends up in danger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Zoey101">Zoey 101</a></em> practically revolves around this. Despite being in high school (as well as Dustin being a middle schooler), the students are able to go pretty much wherever without any adult supervision. The fact that it's a campus a lot of them hang out at makes it seem as if they were in college instead.
</li><li> This trope is usually deconstructed and portrayed as negative in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>. It is usually because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a> and is often the cause of children being kidnapped, injured, or raped. One episode has Munch mentioning to a ten-year-old boy that, when he was his age, his parents wouldn't even let him ride around the block on his bike but the boy goes on the subway by himself.
</li><li> All over the place in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Yeralash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Yeralash">Yeralash</a></em>, where the kids from the elementary up are seen to freely wander around the city, using public transport, etc., because the children <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">are generally allowed much more independence</a> from the early age in Russia, compared to the US.

Lan's parents sometimes show worry, but he's still able to battle dangerous criminals without being held up in his room. To say nothing about Mayl, Dex, and Yai. While they occasionally can't accompany Lan to something or other due to something during the main plot, they always at least try to follow Lan into the evil base at the end of each game. The epitome of this has to be the 5th game where Yai manages to take the entire gang to a <em>deserted island</em> two hours away from home. And then they go to explore an <em>abandoned mine</em> with predictable results. You'd think after that their parents would never let them go anywhere on their own again. The second anime eventually solves this by making Lan a "Net Savior", basically an agent of the Net Police. After this he stops randomly wandering into criminals on random adventures and is actively dispatched into crime scenes and anyone attempting to stop him on the grounds that a dangerous site is no place for a child will immediately yield when he shows them his badge.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The characters wander about their local region at a young age, with little concern from any adults. Although to be fair, the regions appear to so small that if one chucked a rock hard enough, it could cross several cities. It also makes sense that only children with tamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> are allowed to roam freely. It seems to almost be a rite of passage. Even then, most child trainers don't appear to really go far from home until they're in their teens, with this even being the case for the protagonist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Black and White</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite2">its direct sequel</a>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">X and Y</a></em>. Regardless, it's still a bit odd seeing very young trainers, such as preschoolers and the kids you see at beaches being farther from home than Campers and Youngsters.

There are a few instances where Jimmy is prevented from flying in his homemade rocket into space (Without a space helmet even!) before finishing his chores, but still, that is incredibly free rein. On a typical day, the kids will go down to the local fast food joint to hang out, and their parents are nowhere in sight. Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyNeutronBoyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyNeutronBoyGenius">Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</a></em> where the plot revolved around the kids feeling annoyed about the restrictions their parents keep placing on them. But really, the only thing they kept him from doing was going to a theme park on a school night, which really isn't that bad.

Still, she's somehow managed to build a global network of contacts that she's done favors for and can get a ride to anywhere on Earth.

</li><li> Their traditional selves are canonically high school age (the oldest two being seventeen and Velma being <em>fourteen</em>) but can travel cross country and get into serious situations without adults. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">original premise</a> handwaved this since they were musicians on tour but the actual series says nothing about it. Averted in many later incarnations where they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeLift">age lifted</a> into adults.

<ul><li> The show does this frequently and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> it with jokes about Homer's neglectfulness as a parent. It is also (coincidentally?) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">trope namer</a>, as this phrase is seen in the Halloween episode, Treehouse of Horror V, although it was used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeFromRealGirlScouts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeFromRealGirlScouts">rather more literally</a> in that context, the opposite / an inversion of this trope.
<div class="indent"> As they tiptoe down the hall, Bart can't resist looking into the detention room. It's now set up with small cages in which children are given some sort of IV. Martin looks haggard in his cage and he shakes convulsively, bringing an admonishment from Skinner: "Easy there, young man, you'll only make yourself tired and stringy. Now, to check on the <strong>free-range children</strong>," he continues, looking out the window at a pasture of children running around.)
</div></li><li> Averted in the season 27 episode "Orange Is The New Yellow" Marge gets arrested because she let Bart go to the park by himself. Marge mentions in court that when she was a kid she was allowed to be alone outside all day, which gets her mother retroactively arrested.

(Lack of concern from Peter is expected.) However, he's still working on how to use the toilet. (Stewie, that is.) But Brian the dog does serve as a guardian for Stewie.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> franchise often has a problem with this;
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>, the parents keep the babies in a playpen, but they just walk away from them after they are put away, allowing them to escape and roam about with no interference. This gets ridiculous in one episode, in which the parents are visiting a store. They put the kids down, and literally walk away like it is nobody's business.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a></em>: One particular episode involved the 11-year-olds Tommy and Chuckie going down to a warehouse in <em>another part of town at night</em> where <em>two possible criminals could have been working</em>, in order to protect Kimi.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers">Captain Planet and the Planeteers</a></em>: A few of the main characters are not adults yet run all about saving the Earth, but we never hear any complaints from any of the moms and dads about what their kids are doing (the one or two that are still alive, that is). They have powers but that isn't much better.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RocketPower">Rocket Power</a></em>: The late elementary school cast runs all about Ocean Shores with little concern from their parents. To be fair, Ray tends to be laid back about everything, except when the gang really screws up. He also works in a restaurant near the beach and skate park, where the kids usually are. Twister's parents, just say to him when he gets in trouble, "We'll talk about this later," and little is usually shown after that. Sam's mom is pretty fussy, but he still tags along wherever the gang goes. And presumably, she wants him to be within a certain area where he can contact an adult. Also it looks like the kids are more around a certain area of Ocean shores. Most of the action takes place around their cul-de-sac and the pier which is <em>right</em> where Ray works. There are a couple occasions where they appear to go outside the zone and have to use a GPS, or get in trouble when they're caught doing something unsafe like surfing in a channel.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em> is usually an aversion, as the action is typically restricted to the cul-de-sac and adjacent areas, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">like in plenty other suburban areas</a>. For the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">Big Damn Movie</a>, however, the characters travel across country without supervision (justified with the Eds, who are essentially on the lam, not so much for the others), crossing sweltering deserts, festering swamps, and abandoned factories. The Eds are even "driving" a car at one point (meaning that Ed is running through the bottom of the car, Flintstones style).
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>, Timmy and the other kids will be seen wandering the town on their own when the plot calls for it. One episode had Timmy biking through the desert and at a fast-food restaurant <em>at night</em> without his parents. He also tends to spend extended amounts of time in Fairy World without his parents noticing. As in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, 99% of the adults in the show aren't exactly the brightest bulbs on the tree.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer">Dora the Explorer</a></em> and her cousins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoDiegoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoDiegoGo">Go, Diego, Go!</a></em>. Dora is a little girl let run around the rain forest with her equally young monkey friend, while Diego and his sister aren't even high schoolers yet go on <em>animal rescue missions</em> on their own. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraAndFriendsIntoTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraAndFriendsIntoTheCity">Dora and Friends: Into the City!</a></em> Dora is a preteen with a group of similarly aged friends yet they are allowed full range of the city.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWildThornberrys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWildThornberrys">The Wild Thornberrys</a></em>: i.e. the one about the little girl who wanders around the jungle with no parental supervision, avoiding crises and conversing with the local wildlife with the aid of her foreign language-speaking monkey and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">Raised by Wolves</a> little brother. To be fair, Mr. and Mrs. Thornberry's biggest failing as parents is that they seem to put too much trust in their teenage daughter Debbie to keep an eye on things while they're away studying said local wildlife. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnMovie">Big Damn Movie</a>, when they discover that Eliza's managed to chase after a poacher despite having been sent to a London boarding school, they're horrified that Eliza would put herself in that much danger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>: None of the parents seem to pay any attention to their kids, but Dib and Gaz have extra free range on account of their dad being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>. One episode seems to lampshade the trope when Zim himself gets lost by trying to go to a different part of town on his own.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/RupertBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/RupertBear">Rupert</a></em>, Rupert and his friends travel around the world and back, consort with all sorts of mythological creatures... and then are told by their parents that they're too young to go camping out without parental supervision.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em>:
<ul><li> In both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">the original</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016">2016 series</a>, part of ten-year-old cousins Ben and Gwen's free rein comes from their elderly grandfather Max, who is driving them around the United States for their summer camping trip and is not as physically fit as he was in his younger days. The original series has less justification, as that continuity had Max as part of an interstellar police/counter-terrorist organization for most of his adult life, which you'd think would give him the common sense to keep better watch around Ben, who happens to have one of the most powerful pieces of technology in the galaxy but repeatedly disregards caution and attacks alien evildoers with no concern for the consequences. In both versions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">but especially the original</a>, Gwen's maturity in accessing dangerous situations somewhat of justifies the lack of supervision.
</li><li> Averted in the second series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em>, where Ben has matured noticeably from his hyperactive young self, but still happens to be a 15-year-old boy dealing in potentially fatal missions on an intergalactic scale. The only reason his parents don't put the leash on him is that they are not even aware of his escapades until the episode "Grounded", at which point they forbid him from using his Omnitrix and restrict his day-to-day activities for fear of his safety. Which he promptly ignores, because there's absolutely nothing they can do to enforce it when he can transform at will into dozens of super-powered aliens. His parents lift the punishment before the episode is even close to over.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens">Big City Greens</a></em>: In addition to the family traversing Big City, Cricket, Tilly, and their other kid friends are allowed to traverse themselves without adult supervision.
</li><li> This trope may be an understatement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em>. The child-based organization's operatives get their training in an Arctic Base built in the coldest part of Antarctica, they are brought to the Moon (toward the KND Moonbase, natch) to be submitted into the KND when training's finished, and while they're KND Operative, usually depending on their job within the KND, may be sent anywhere in the world, all with their parents taking little to no notice. In <em>some</em> cases their parents notice, and often even <em>approve</em>. In fact, Numbuh 5 points out to Numbuh 4 that the KND only fight <em>evil</em> adults — while their parents may be kind of strict and perhaps embarrassing at times, they aren't necessarily "evil" and only want what's best for their children.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>, the high-school-aged kids walk around Lawndale without a driver's license until later on.

Sweetie Belle's parents only appear once; otherwise she's in the care of her older sisterRarity. It's eventually revealed in Season 7 that the Apple Bloom <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">had</a></em> parents, but it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">all but outright stated</a> that they died</span>. According to a licensed book (and later confirmed in the show), Scootaloo is mainly raised by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism">her aunts</a> because her parents are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenYouComingHomeDad">busy with work</a> (which turns out to be exploring far-off territories for scientific work). It's debatable exactly how old the CMC are, however. If one views Cutie Marks as an analogy to puberty the trio could very well be the equivalent of 9 or 10 in human years (possibly even older) which is plenty old enough to be wandering around a sleepy rural village on their own.
</li><li> Subverted in the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E21DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E21DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a>", where the girls let Spike go alone on a quest to join migrating dragons, but it turns out they were planning to follow him all along anyway.

The same with Kyle. They still do attend school, though.
</li><li> Gary and Joel are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Unsupervised" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Unsupervised">Unsupervised</a></em>, they have no parents with them and are left to figure everything out by themselves.
</li><li> The heroes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheZow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheZow">SheZow</a></em> are able to go to far-off places thanks to the Shehicle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em> doesn't seem to keep that close an eye on Penny, although she does seem to fly around often with the family dog Brain. Then again, maybe that's for the best because the inspector is seen as a bumbling idiot and sometimes ends up in a situation where he could lose his life and make Penny a possible foster child. Episodes sometimes start in places where the bulk of the action takes place. Examples include the circus, New York, and the arctic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Maisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Maisy">Maisy</a></em> is a highly odd example. Not only is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoAdults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoAdults">There Are No Adults</a> in effect, but the characters, a cute female mouse and her friends go where they want, do what they want, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalDriversLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalDriversLicense">drive cars, fly planes</a>, take their own baths, etc. Really, there's nothing explicitly indicating that they <em>aren't</em> adults, other than their very childlike appearance, childlike babble speech and tendency to play with toys and stuffed animals (not that adults don't ever do that last one, of course.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EmilyAndTheBabaYaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EmilyAndTheBabaYaga">Emily and the Baba Yaga</a></em>, the adults send Emily off alone into the forest, and her father doesnt seem to worry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaxAndRuby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MaxAndRuby">Max and Ruby</a></em> features an older sister who seems to care for her younger brother 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with only sporadic intervention by their grandmother. The two regularly go shopping across town via bus, among other things. Supposedly the parents are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleParents">offscreen</a> but nothing suggests this in-series. At least until the 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">Retool</a>, which added on-screen parents.
</li><li> Out of all the main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLifeAsATeenageRobot">My Life as a Teenage Robot</a></em>, Jenny is the only one who has an onscreen parent. Parents of others such as Brad and Tuck, Sheldon, and the Crust Cousins are never seen nor mentioned.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em>, Kion and his friends seem barely older than Simba was in the first half of the original film yet are allowed to run around everywhere, even into the Outlands. They are at least <em>partially</em> justified due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Kid Heroes</a> however Kion's only slightly older sister Kiara and her friends can do the same despite not having any powers.

Their parents are apparently entirely unconcerned about there being any real danger within it that could trouble unsupervised children.

Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusEpisode">Episode 33</a>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Stumpy</a>'s mother sees him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JugglingDangerously" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JugglingDangerously">juggling chainsaws</a> on TV and calls him so she can tell him to stop because it's too dangerous.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>: The triplets and Webby are hit with cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Mom</a>, leaving them free to go off on their own adventures. Helping this case is the fact that Great-Uncle Scrooge and Grandma Beakley are totally fine with letting the kids go off on their own, as long as they let the adults know. And as for Uncle Donald, well, he's tied up trying find a job to support his nephews, and by the end of the pilot episode, has accepted the fact that the nephews have inherited the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily">family's adventuring genes</a> too.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em>, the children are always doing stuff on their own, such as building a treehouse. Craig Bartlett even stated that the kids' adventures are supposed to be similar to his childhood adventures where the kids would just run around without adult supervision. Although, the kids do have adult supervision in space. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ReadyJetGoOneSmallStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ReadyJetGoOneSmallStep">One Small Step</a></em>, which marks the first time that the kids go to space by themselves. However, they got Carrot and Celery's permission to go by themselves.
</li><li> The Mystery Twins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> are given fairly free range of the town whenever they don't have to work in the Mystery Shack. Granted, the other employees of the shack often hang out with them, but Soos is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">manchild</a>, and Wendy is only a few years older than the twins herself. Increasingly averted in season 2, when their grunkle<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">s</span> begin to spend more time with them. Played straight by Lil' Gideon, whose parents simply can't control him, and he does whatever he wants whether they like it or not.
</li><li> Taken to it's natural conclusion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em>. They frequently build amazing inventions in their backyard, and doing so often takes them all across the town of Danville. Certain episodes have them travelling around the world or to the north pole. Whenever they get questioned (which is frequent, especially in early seasons), they agree <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">that yes, they</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">ARE</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">a little young to be doing the activity in question</a>. Naturally, their parents never find out about any of their schemes.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> franchise combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">AdultsAreUseless</a>:
<ul><li> While a staple of the <em>Peanuts</em> franchise as stated above, it's taken to extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RaceForYourLifeCharlieBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RaceForYourLifeCharlieBrown">Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown</a></em>. Here the children, while in summer camp, embark on a multi-day raft race through a mountainous river without any adult supervision. They encounter dangerous rapids. They are apparently high enough in the mountains that it snows in the summer. They luck out and find a warm cabin to spend the night. All the while, they have to deal with "bullies" who are actually a group of psychopaths who actually try to kill them by sending them down a dangerous fork in the river.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ItsTheGreatPumpkinCharlieBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ItsTheGreatPumpkinCharlieBrown">It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</a></em> is pushing it even by 1960s standards. Linus is allowed to sit in a pumpkin patch all alone on a dark night and he even falls asleep outside. It's his <em>sister</em> (not his parents) who decide to bring him home.
</li></ul></li><li> This is usually averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou">Caillou</a></em> but one episode, "Caillou Walks Around the Block", involves four-year-old Caillou getting out of the house on his own and walking around town. It is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BannedEpisode">Banned Episode</a> on PBS precisely because Caillou is unattended while outdoors.
</li><li> A "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">Superstar</a>" segment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Jem">Jem</a></em> features eight-year-old Ba Nee walking home with two kids. The blonde girl, who is even younger than Ba Nee, somehow went to the pharmacy and picked up her dad's prescription pain medicine all by herself.
<ul><li> It used to be extremely common to send children on errands like these, including to buy cigarettes. You gave them an extra nickel to buy something for themselves as well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCrumpets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCrumpets">The Crumpets</a></em>: King, a lion-costumed boy who is one of the three <em>youngest</em> of the 142 Crumpet children, learns that the captive exotic animals owned by his adult brother Grownboy are endangered by his sister Caprice, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> Hurried and Granny. Offscreen, he travels from the family's house to Grownboy's house on a high-rise in the middle of the city, arriving with facial bruises and his costume slightly worn out.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ewoks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ewoks">Ewoks</a></em> episode, "The Land of the Gupins," Wicket and his friends agree to help the Gupins almost at the drop of a hood. However, there is also an apparent last-minute comment by Teebo, depicted in the distance as an imposed voice over line, that they intend to speak to their Elders first, and the scene changes to the characters on their way with permission to go apparently granted.

</li><li> The Free-Range Parenting movement, kickstarted by journalist Lenore Skenazy when she let her then-nine-year-old son ride the New York subway home alone in 2008 causing her to be dubbed the "World's Worst Mom" by some detractors<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17nqg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17nqg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17nqg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Her son arrived home safe and sound without incident</span>, openly advocates for reduced parental supervision and letting children take on age-appropriate independent activities. Skenazy herself has written a book and hosted a television series extolling the virtues of more relaxed parenting.

</li><li> As noted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSmartForStrangers">Too Smart for Strangers</a> and in a similar manner to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingWhiteWomanSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingWhiteWomanSyndrome">Missing White Woman Syndrome</a>, child abductions had a massive spike <em>in news coverage</em> in the '80s, which lead to a societal shift towards more attentive parenting and restrictions on kids being able to act independently. In reality, statistically child abductions are far more likely to be from family members (particularly disaffected divorced parents) or known acquaintances than complete strangers coming across them on the street<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29f7g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note29f7g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29f7g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Kidnapping is a crime that tends to be planned out rather than a crime of opportunity</span>.
</li><li> Averted in Japan, once a kid enters middle school it's liberty gets severely limited at an age where you would expect them to acquire more liberties to socialize out of home, they're expected to get from home to school and vice versa alone but only trough a pre selected path, they can't use smartphones, just regular cellphones and only for emergencies. It should be noted that all of this is just in paper and can't actually stop kids, to counteract this you can get reprimanded in school for your personal activities outside of school hours and schools have been pushing cram schools which leaves kids with even less free time.
</li><li> This trope is in full effect in many countries other than the United States (though Americanization turns more and more parents into helicopter parents). Especially prevalent in The Netherlands and Denmark where children who have outgrown the child seats of their parents' bicycle are expected to bike to and from school, after-school activities, etc... In other countries many towns have functional public transportation that isn't considered dangerous. Children frequently commute on this system on their own.
