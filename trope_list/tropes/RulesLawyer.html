</p><p>Rules Lawyers come in different flavors ranging from obnoxious to helpful, and including just plain dumb, although the term usually carries a negative connotation. Besides being of any moral alignment at all, what all versions have in common is a nigh-encyclopedic knowledge of every single aspect of the rules of the system. The difference between the three is largely down to attitude and how they use that knowledge. In brief, Obnoxious Rules Lawyers manipulate the rules to give themselves advantages, Dumb Rules Lawyers will always insist on following the rules <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">even when it's clear it won't work</a>, while Helpful Rules Lawyers play by the rules even if that puts them at a disadvantage, and will even try to use their knowledge to help out someone else.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The Obnoxious Rules Lawyer, which is also called a "Rule Shark", is particularly annoying because they believe that because they can find a rule about something, the people in charge <em>must</em> allow them to do it, even if it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">doesn't make sense</a>, or would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">screw with what's going on</a>. They're convinced that, with the power of the <em>rules</em>, they can outmaneuver everyone and get what they want. They will attempt to employ every loophole, every odd circumstance, and every footnote they can. Expect the Rule Shark to have pored over the rules — <em>all</em> the rules. Most annoyingly, they seem to remember only the parts that support whatever they're doing at that moment, intentionally ignoring whatever doesn't support their own case, and usually bringing it up when they're threatened in some way. Such people <em>will</em> insist on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> wherever necessary.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Usually, the first rule the Rules Lawyer conveniently "forgets" while making their arguments is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero">Rule Zero</a>: that <em>the GM/owner of the site/boss is always right.</em> Squashing them with this early is the best bet; attempting to argue about rules with them only encourages their behavior. If invoked, they might dare to argue that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleZero">Rule Zero</a> is an <em>unwritten</em> rule, despite it being a foundation principle. It won't work with some rule systems, which <em>do</em> have a form of Rule Zero codified.
</p><p>They are among the few people who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint">Read the Fine Print</a>. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRuleFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRuleFuIsStrongerThanYours">My Rule-Fu Is Stronger Than Yours</a> for the argument that is going to happen at some point, especially if there are <em>two</em> of them at the table. If a rule ever seems to be written rather verbosely, or explain things that seem like common sense, it's the writers trying to stop these guys.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid Rules Lawyer</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HanlonsRazor">incompetent instead of malicious.</a> They'll constantly grind play to a halt to make sure that everyone is following the rules even if the end result would be the same anyway. They won't allow any technique that isn't specified in the rules to be used, causing the game to become rigid. If the GM decides to make some well designed and balanced homebrews then this lawyer will start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">throwing a fit.</a>
</p><p>However, this trope does come in a positive variant referred to as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good Rules Lawyer</a>: they always stick to the rules, no matter how bad it might be for them personally. And they'll point out exactly the proper rules that state that, no, they didn't escape the deathtrap, they died.
</p><p>Conversely, in a tabletop setting, the rules are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters">Player Characters</a>' primary means of interacting with the world, and if a GM is constantly changing the rules mid-game, the players cannot play. Gaming groups must, by necessity, be a mutually policing force. Sometimes a Rules Lawyer is necessary when the GM is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">repeatedly sending waves and waves of homebrewed</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion">mooks who are immune to everything</a> except the powers of that one super-duper archmage the GM has been writing a novel about for the last seven years and if you try to fight them without the archmage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GMPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GMPC">GMPC</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">you die</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">No save</a>.
</p><p>In this instance, the Rules Lawyer is one check against GM misbehavior, as in a healthy gaming group, the GM is answerable to the players as much as the players are answerable to the GM because it is everybody's game.
</p><p>A Lawful Good Rules Lawyer can also be a valuable thing to have in your gaming group if one or more of the players in your gaming group cheats or doesn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFreakingManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFreakingManual">RTFM</a>. Even when the rest of the group is on the level, the fact that a Rules Lawyer will, by definition, know all of the rules can make them useful for a gaming group as the ultimate natural language database. The Lawful Good Rules Lawyer can also be tremendously valuable by knowing the rules well enough to keep rules-heavy segments of play (like combat) flowing smoothly and quickly, by keeping obscure or highly-situational rules in the front of their brain or knowing about the potentially-wonky interactions of various expanded and optional rules sets, freeing the GM up to focus on creating a rich world, vibrant characters, and compelling narrative for the players to interact with.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">The Trickster</a> are constantly given this trait. It is something of a recognised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes">Player Archetype</a>, and in that sense can be considered a sister-trope to other such archetypes.

<ul><li> Lelouch vi Britannia from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> often applies this to his Geass powers (mostly in season 1). Best example (in season 1) would be when he used his Geass on <em>himself</em> to alter his own memories, so the mind-reader he was fighting wouldn't grasp Lelouch's real plan until it was too late. In season 2 he just outright cheats. Or at least this is how he sees it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He starts commanding people to follow all of his orders. Basically wishing for unlimited wishes</span>.
</li><li> Sora from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NoGameNoLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NoGameNoLife">No Game No Life</a></em>, often using the Ten Pledges to his advantage.
</li><li> Light Yagami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> is constantly exploiting the rules of the Death Notes in obscure and bizarre ways to accomplish his goals. Arguably, the entire series is about Rules Lawyering.
<ul><li> Example: a victim can't be made to write things about Death Notes before they die because they don't know about them and so wouldn't reasonably write about them. But what they can be made to do is write a poem where the first letter of each line "just happens" to form a message about Death Notes or just about anything else.
</li><li> In the live-action movie adaptation, Light gets around the rule that says you can't use the Death Note to make someone commit murder by engineering a situation where murder is the only possible way a death could happen (writing "Person A will go to this isolated location and be accidentally shot dead at 10:05 PM" and "Person B will obtain a gun, go to that same location, and discharge their gun at 10:05 PM").
</li><li> One rule that seems to be about stopping Rules Lawyering (and doesn't come up in the story): If you misspell someone's name they don't die, and if you do so by accident four times in a Death Note, they can no longer be killed by that Death Note. But if you misspell their name <em>deliberately</em> four times, then <em>you</em> die. Yeah, the book knows the difference.
</li></ul></li><li> Some rather impressive rules lawyering is used during the Frieza saga in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, using careful exploitation of two different rulesets of two different sets of Dragon Balls to not only reactivate one of them after Piccolo's death in the previous arc rendered them useless, but to resurrect everyone who died in the previous arc, and nearly everyone who died during the Frieza saga (one particular village, unfortunately, couldn't be saved due to it being wiped out by Vegeta after he defected from Frieza's army, meaning "Bring back everyone killed by Frieza's minions" didn't apply,) <em>and</em> ensure that everyone got off Namek before it exploded, <em>and</em> rebuild Namek and send the Namekians back to their homeworld.
</li><li> The boys of Class-3E in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em> get in on this during the sports festival. After Asano forces them to compete in a pole-toppling game, the boys memorize the rule book to outsmart Class A. Tactics included were using their own pole as a weapon and leaving the playing field by running into the stands since the rules never said they <em>couldn't</em> do it.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Audio Plays </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Kelly from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/WereAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/WereAlive">We're Alive</a></em> gets caught sleeping on guard duty and points out that, while there is a rule that everyone has to "pull guard duty," there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">no rule</a> against falling asleep in the guard room. She is an <em>actual lawyer</em> after all, so it shouldn't be a surprise.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Card Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Parodied (naturally) in the card game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a></em> with the card <em>Invoke Obscure Rules</em>. This card has been translated as <em>Regelneuker</em> in the Dutch version, which is actually the Dutch word for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a> and literally translates as "rule fucker."
<ul><li> It is completely legal to play Go Up A Level cards on <em>your opponents</em> while they are facing monsters that have a "Will not pursue under level X" restriction. (This wasn't the original intention of the card when it was made, but the creators of the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">officially confirmed it as a valid tactic,</a> as it was in the spirit of the game.)
</li><li> Or, after several cards have been played to jump to a level that can actually kill the enemy in question, dumping a "Friendly" on it. No treasure, no fight, no level up.
</li><li> If you fail to defeat/run away from the Orcs, you lose levels equal to the number you roll on a die unless it's a one or a two, in which case you die. However, if you are "unlucky" enough to have a Chicken-on-your-Head (subtract one from all die rolls) you can actually roll a zero, which is neither a one or a two so you don't die, and you lose zero levels.
</li><li> In <em>Munchkin Cthulhu</em>, the Cultist class gets a bonus for each other Cultist in play. It's possible to multiclass using <em>Super Munchkin</em> and become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Cultist Cultist</a>, which gives you a +4 bonus for being <em>yourself</em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">Twice.</a></em>
</li><li> One card even specifies 'reveal your hand' as 'your cards, not the thing at the end of your arm'.
</li><li> The rules actually include one very important rule for rules-lawyers. "If in doubt, the owner of the game wins." Meaning that it is always a better idea to be the owner of that particular copy of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly to <em>Munchkin</em>, much of the point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> is to find unusual ways to twist the rules to win. While any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> will eventually be banned, Magic notably has no "rule zero" or "rule seven" enforcing the spirit of the rules or prohibiting things that don't make sense according to the game's story. If you can figure out a legitimate loophole in the letter of the rules, there's nothing to prevent you from exploiting it until the rules are officially changed.
<ul><li> Magic tournament judges can impose penalties on players who push their rules-lawyering too far if they deem to be disruptive to the tournament or as stalling to run out the clock. Over the years the tournament rules have changed a lot to give judges a lot of leeway when handling stuff like this.
<ul><li> A famous example of a judge cracking down on rules lawyers occurred at French Nationals when a few players discovered that the DCI (ruling body of sanctioned tournament Magic) made a mistake when posting updated card wordings on their webpage. One card was posted with an old, obsolete wording which allowed for an obscenely powerful combo. Since the wording on the webpage was considered to supersede any other wording, the players tried to use it in the tournament. The Head Judge disallowed the combo and when some of the players played it anyway, he expelled them from the tournament. The DCI backed him on it and upheld the penalties.

</li><li> One that was patched within a couple days of discovery: a player used an existing ruling on the Time Vault card to argue that mana generation cards could be used between turns as well as during them. A particular card had the limitation that it could not be used more than once <em>during</em> a single turn. Hello, infinite mana (with a card combo to prevent infinite damage from mana burn.)
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=603">Chaos Orb<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a rather bizarre card that lends itself to rather bizarre interpretations of the rules—its effect is that you flip it up in the air, and it destroys any cards it lands on. One quick glance at the errata gives you an idea of the headaches it has caused but the example has to be the player who <em>ripped the card into pieces</em> and then scattered it over his opponent's cards.
<ul><li> This incident was immortalized in the <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5712">Chaos Confetti<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> card which <em>demands</em> that Chaos Confetti be used <em>in this exact manner</em>. Clearly, this is a single-use card.
</li></ul></li><li> In late 2011, a tournament rules document was revised to no longer penalize players for missing their own beneficial triggered abilities. The accompanying caveat was that even if you remembered the ability, you could choose to ignore it, and your opponent couldn't point it out and force you to resolve it either. This revision was quickly yanked when people realized that you could play the card <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cranialinsertion.com/card/TOR/8875">Transcendence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and refuse to ever gain life (a "beneficial ability"), making you effectively unkillable by damage.
</li><li> It's worth noting that MTG Rules Lawyers are a <em>legitimate demographic</em> for WotC (they're referred to as "Melvin").
</li><li> In one of the Un sets, a card by the name Rules Lawyer was added, with the following text:
<div class="indent"> State-based actions don't apply to you or other permanents you control. (You don't lose the game due to having 0 or less life or drawing from an empty library. Your creatures aren't destroyed due to damage or deathtouch and aren't put into a graveyard due to having 0 or less toughness. Your planeswalkers aren't put into a graveyard if they have 0 loyalty. You don't put a legendary permanent into a graveyard if you control two with the same name. Counters aren't removed from your permanents due to game rules. Permanents you control attached or combined illegally remain on the battlefield. For complete rules and regulations, see rule 704.)
</div></li></ul><dl><dt></dt><dd> And this means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>, though there are several classifications and specifications, and they're actually found exactly where the cars indicates that can be.
</dd></dl></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> has a few ways of exploiting its very odd rules. For example, there's a card that requires you to discard a monster from your hand to summon it. The card can discard itself to summon itself.
<ul><li> There's also the Synchro Monster 'Colossal Fighter' which, when destroyed, can special summon a warrior-type monster from either player's Graveyard. Since 'Colossal Fighter' activates this effect while itself is in the graveyard, it can actually summon <em>itself</em> back onto the field.
</li><li> One card (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">before it had its wording changed</a>) called Magical Blast is a moderately useful card on its own. It deals damage to your opponent by an amount dictated by how many Spellcasters you have on the field, for a max of 1000 damage in a game where the players start with 8000 life. However, you could skip your next draw phase to get the card back into your hand. But if someone wanted to take it by the wording rather than the intent, then it becomes obvious you can do this any time, like right after casting it once, allowing you to do infinite damage (on turn one no less if you draw it and a Spellcaster monster) if your opponent doesn't have a way to counter and remove the spell from the game. The errata'd version of the card states that you can only return it to your hand at your draw step (instead of drawing) which is how it was supposed to work.

</li><li> In the short story <em>And Then There Were None</em>, a ship from Earth lands on a remote planet that has been out of contract for centuries and starts trying to reopen contact with the inhabitants. They have a <em>very</em> hard time understanding the native Gands, but since they're not hostile by the regulations' definition, the men can't legally be denied leave. Problem is, so many like the planet they go AWOL. Too many Space Lawyers on his crew know the regs by heart, so despite much-attempted wrangling to make the natives fit the definition of hostile, they fail but find that leave <em>can</em> be postponed continually — though it only makes the crew more mutinous.

</li><li> The Unseelie Accords, the rules that govern interactions between the supernatural "nations" were written by Queen Mab, who set them up so that there is no "spirit of the Law", just the literal wording. A note by one of the characters in the margins even calls Mab a Rules Lawyer. In <em>Summer Knight</em>, after agreeing not to try to use the threat of retribution to coerce Harry into accepting her job, Mab tweaks his injured hand; when Harry complains that she agreed not to do any of that, she points out that that wasn't coercion, that was just for spite, which was completely acceptable according to the terms of their agreement.
</li><li> The Red King employs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyUnnecessaryTranslator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyUnnecessaryTranslator">Completely Unnecessary Translator</a> for this purpose: when he reneges on a deal, he can truthfully say that <em>he</em> never agreed to anything.

Njál is best at this, but many of the other lawyers in the saga are pretty good at manipulating the law as well. At a moment of climax in the saga, the wily Eyjolf gets the entire prosecution of the burners thrown out of court on a technicality, which angers Thorhall so much that he strides into the courtroom with a spear and ganks the first guy he sees. The biggest battle in the saga breaks out immediately after, which is all the more dramatic given that violence was taboo at the Althing.
</li><li> In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Barrayar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Barrayar">Barrayar</a></em>, the only person who has the authority to countermand an order given to a Count's Armsman is the Emperor. So when Cordelia needs to leave Tanery Base to rescue her son from Vordarian, the fact that Bothari, the Armsman seconded to her, is under orders to stay there is a problem. Then Bothari explains that when the Count's heir seconded him to her, he said to obey her orders as if they were his own. And since that heir, Aral Vorkosigan, was <em>the Imperial Regent</em> (even if he wasn't thinking of himself in that position when giving the order), that meant Cordelia has the legal authority of the Emperor as far as Bothari is concerned.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThursdayNext">Something Rotten</a></em>, a professional croquet team includes a squad of lawyers, since Rules Lawyering is a significant (and expected) part of the game in that universe.

</li><li> Albert Haddock in AP Herbert's <em>Misleading Cases in the Common Law</em> is a rules lawyer for the actual law, able to twist any statute or precedent into supporting a completely ludicrous case, and leading unfortunate judges to have to rule on things like whether a motor car traversing a flooded road could be considered a boat.

Many chairs will ignore "parliamentary maneuvering" and force the debate forwards via force of personality. Indeed, it is widely considered to be irritating and spiteful to make incessant points of order, parliamentary procedure, etc, because it slows the debate to a crawl and generally makes everyone bored. It is also frequently exploited by WAAC (win at all costs) MUNers/Gavelhunters in order to give themselves the maximum amount of speech-time. Of course, this can often lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRuleFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRuleFuIsStrongerThanYours">My Rule-Fu Is Stronger Than Yours</a>—if the Chair tries to fight back against a delegate making these maneuvers, that delegate may appeal to the rulebook—and since the Chair typically has an Undersecretary-General and Secretary-General above him/her as arbiters of the rules, they may not get their way.

Captain Sheridan and Captain Lochley both had their moments as well, and all of the ambassadors were known to twist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">reality</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">language</a> as far as the rules and circumstances would let them for their own nations' political gain.
<ul><li> Sinclair's example from the first season is a bit special, though, since we are outright told that the only reason Sinclair got away with bending the spirit of his orders like he did was that the voting public approved of his actions, and censuring him for doing what he did would endanger his political masters' re-election campaigns.

For example, in "The Footpath", he discovers that his house is built over a public footpath, and takes it upon himself to put a sign indicating the footpath in his front garden and a stile over the fence in his back garden, ignoring his wife's concerns about a steady stream of ramblers walking across their property. It isn't until a member of the local Council tells him that only they can erect footpath signs, and they have no plans to do so since the footpath through the Bryces' garden became defunct when the house was built in the 1970s, that he removes the sign.

One example given is that one of God's commandments was "Honor your father and mother", while Jewish law also allowed people to declare possessions "corban", or dedicated to God so that they couldn't be used for something as mundane as, say, retirement pension. People were exploiting this to avoid supporting their parents, and Jesus called them out for using a law they made up to get around one that God Himself had given.

<ul><li> The Landlord. When purchasing a Base, for every +5 points your Base doubles in size. After spending a couple hundred points in this manner, you'll have a Base whose grounds cover the <em>known universe</em>. Furthermore, when purchasing Henchmen to man your Base, every +5 points doubles the number of henchmen you have; so at 170 points, you can have 8 billion loyal followers (the entire population of Earth and then some).

Rules Lawyering = <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">moving faster than the speed of light</a>.
</li><li> The most egregious example (although it is usually played for laughs) is the fact that while it has rules restricting what you can do while you are dying, there are no such rules for dead characters. By a completely literal interpretation of the rules, you could argue that there is no reason a dead player can't get right back up and continue adventuring without having to worry about hp anymore.
</li><li> A rather famous (though not particularly serious and now outdated) bit of rules-lawyering is the "Villager Railgun", which abuses the mechanics behind "free actions". Basically, a free action is any action which takes so little time/effort, it can be done virtually instantaneously - examples include gestures, dropping items, and, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction">talking.</a> Free actions are, well, free - a character can use any number of them, even if it's not their turn. Older editions allowed characters to pass suitably light objects to someone standing right next to them as a free action. Players with a working knowledge of physics quickly stumbled upon a loophole - line up a few thousand villagers in a straight line, all standing right next to each other, with one end of the line next to a pile of light objects and the other close to the designated target. Have the villager on one end of the line pick up a light object and, on the "firing" turn, have them pass it to the next person in line as a free action. Then have that person pass it to the next person as a free action. Repeat until it reaches the other end of the line, at which point the receiver throws it at his target. Physics indicates that the object just travelled several thousand metres in less than six seconds (the length of a round in D&amp;D), giving it enough kinetic energy to destroy pretty much anything it's thrown at (Although by the actual rules, it will only deal 1 or 2 damage - the trick relies on real-world physics being applied selectively in a very specific and nonsensical manner).
</li><li> Another amusing example is the "Chicken Infested" flaw. Only available to Commoners, it gives you a 50% chance to pull out a chicken from a container. Pulling things out of a spell pouch is a free action. Can you say instant infinite chickens?
</li></ul></li><li> Do you want your <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a></em> game to last under six hours? You <em>must</em> become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a> (and not use any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">House Rules</a>).
</li><li> In <em>Nomic</em> each turn consists of players proposing and then voting upon changes to the game's rules, so naturally it involves a lot of Rules Lawyering.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> encourages this! Theoretically, the rules recommend that the players aren't even supposed to read the rules. If they show any sign that they do, the GM is encouraged to kill their character's current clone (all Paranoia PCs have a series of clones so that they can be allowed to die many times without doing character creation each time). Some of the more successful strategies for manipulating other PCs involve using one's (secret) knowledge of the rules to either manipulate an "ally" into breaking a rule or make <em>them</em> look like they've read the rules. The rulebook encourages this, as "reading the rules and lying about it" is <em>perfectly</em> in the spirit of the game.
</li><li> There's a saying among players of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarFleetBattles">Star Fleet Battles</a></em>: "Legal Officer, report to the bridge!" The fact that the rulebook is the size of the Manhattan phone directory doesn't help. Players have been spotted with buttons reading "Scotty, I need a rule in five minutes or we're all dead!" (From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>, suitably tweaked).
</li><li> In one of the books for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a> RPG, there is a section on the Unseelie Accords, the rules that govern interactions between the supernatural "nations". The Accords were written by Queen Mab, who set them up so that there is no "spirit of the Law", just the literal wording. A note by one of the characters in the margins even calls Mab a Rules Lawyer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasy">Warhammer Fantasy</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some background states that the Chaos Gods do this when they fight each other. They are each basically omnipotent in their own universe, so they cobble together a set of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseRules">House Rules</a> for each battle and then proceed to bend them as far as possible in their own favor.
</li><li> Due to a combination of poor proofreading and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">lack of common sense on the player's part</a>, it's fully possible to successfully argue a hilariously long list of crazy rules. Namely, you can argue that Walkers without actual sculpted eyes cannot shoot or "see" things because they have no actual eyes, a model with Rage does not follow its rules because "visible" and "line of sight" are clearly two different terms, and it's perfectly legal to deploy my army on the bookshelf and not on the table. One of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a> army books has a weapon where the player has to draw a line from the gun to the target, and everything along the line is hit... The newer editions explicitly state that it's a straight line and that it's only 1 mm thick. Naturally, any tournament-level discussion board will devolve into insane rantings the minute new rules come out.
</li><li> The Sisters of Battle are an in-universe example; the Ecclesiarchy is forbidden by law from maintaining men under arms. They decided to maintain women under arms instead. In some versions of the story, everyone involved agreed to the loophole <em>before</em> deciding on the wording.
</li><li> "Creative" and/or "Extremely Literal" rules interpretations have given rise to some pretty odd (and occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">game-breaking</a> tactics. These tactics include the Devilfish Bunker, wherein Tau players could use their vehicles as mobile bunkers to shield their weak-in-close-combat units from assault, and the setup to the Monolith Phalanx Drop, where a player was once able to put a character right next to a building in the corner of the map and render both the character and the building immune to shooting (under older versions of the rules, you could only shoot a character if you had line of sight, and you could only shoot a building if it had an enemy unit inside it; thus a character behind, but not in, a building rendered both of them untargettable).
</li><li> The Pyrovore - which already is considered one of the worst units in the game - has an odd quirk thanks to some sloppy rules writing. When shot, the Pyrovore can blow up, potentially taking out anything else that's nearby. Except the rule in question is poorly written and, if you're creative in your interpretation (the exact text is "All units take a number of hits equal to the number of models within d6" of the model"), you can claim that an exploding Pyrovore <em>hits every unit on the battlefield</em>. Rules Lawyers looking for a laugh will occasionally pack the Pyrovore in close to a number of other friendly units, blow it up on purpose and use the technicality to try and wipe out half of the opponent's army (it helps if your own army is in reserve if you try this).
</li><li> Another poorly thought-out rule was Blood Angels dreadnaughts, which can be given jetpacks to fly around the battlefield. However, once again thanks to poor rules wording, the way the codex handled this was to change the unit's type from "Walker" to "Jump Infantry", the latter being a designation that's supposed to apply to roughly human-sized creatures with wings or jump packs (not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a> like the Dreadnaught). Unscrupulous players argue that this allows them to carry Dreadnaughts as passengers in a ship that's roughly the same size as they are (since the ship is allowed to carry Jump Infantry, but not Walkers).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://imgur.com/gallery/V0gND">This story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a particularly (in)famous one that describes a Tau player scoring a victory-by-default by spreading his battle-line extremely thin (one man deep, but spanning the entire width of the table) and deploying it on the opponent's table edge after his opponent opted to keep his entire army in reserve. By the rules as written, this meant that the opponent did not have a valid entry point for his army - units in reserve that cannot legally enter the table count as destroyed, scoring the Tau player an automatic victory on Turn 1.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> has had a few interesting interpretations of the rules over the centuries:
<ul><li> The pawn promotion rule is now specified very carefully to avoid certain abuses — such as remaining a pawn or promoting to an <em>enemy</em> piece. Yes, there are positions where those options are good, although it's vanishingly unlikely that they'd ever occur. See <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke_chess_problem#Offbeat_interpretations_of_the_rules_of_chess">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for an example of when promoting to an enemy piece is more beneficial (to checkmate, blocking the king's escape with something he can't capture), and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.edochess.ca/batgirl/1862Code.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for an example of when remaining a pawn is more beneficial (to run yourself out of moves and force a stalemate quicker than your opponent can force a checkmate).
</li><li> There's <a class="urllink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IopUJv7-_NYC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22three+king+circus%22&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22three%20king%20circus%22&amp;f=false">one story<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where a student promoted his pawn to a king because his teacher, George Koltanowski, had forgotten to mention this was illegal. George says he responded by checkmating both kings at once.
</li><li> To patch a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>, the rules were rewritten to specifically state that the move producing the checkmate must be a <em>legal</em> move. Before this change, some players argued that a checkmate could be performed with an illegal move and still achieve victory because of the rule that any violations cannot be reported after the game is over and, in theory, the game is over the moment you checkmate.
</li><li> A chess puzzle revealed that castling could be done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">three</a></em> directions: queen-side, king-side, and filewise —that is, if a pawn was promoted to rook on the same <em>file</em> as the king, castling could then occur vertically if the new rook had not yet moved. The rules were clarified to say the rooks had to be on the same rank as the King.

<ul><li> Arbitrary code excecution is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">taking this to the extreme.</a> Instead of playing the game normally, the player takes incredibly specific actions at very precise times to execute their own code, using only valid game inputs.

<ul><li> And when you think this is only relegated to TAS'es, there are runners for games like super mario world who execute these tricks in real time, <a class="urllink" href="https://clips.twitch.tv/BillowingCheerfulRaccoonChefFrank">beating games that would take about half an hour in under a minute<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<ul><li> A meta-example is <a class="urllink" href="http://tasvideos.org/2027M.html">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToolAssistedSpeedrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToolAssistedSpeedrun">Tool Assisted Speedrun</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest">Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest</a></em>. Unlike its predecessor, this run's main trick is using a debug sequence to acquire all the bonus coins early.

This does save a bit of backtracking but ultimately would take longer to reach the end of the credits. Since TASVideos rules (as interpreted for this game in particular) state the clock stops at the <em>start</em> of the end credits, and this run starts the end credits earlier, it's <em>technically</em> faster.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1">Donkey Kong Country</a></em>, the player "puts the controller down" (which counts as finishing) when K Rool still has one hit point. The Kongs stand there for a few seconds before K Rool runs into them, hitting one Kong and triggering the other to tag-in... right on top of Rool's head.

</li><li> Also with the Metal Gear launching nukes. Since it uses a rail gun and not fuel, it technically wasn't launching a rocket, so treaties wouldn't cover it.
</li></ul></li><li> Monokuma in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa">Danganronpa</a></em> series has a strict set of rules for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Killing Game</a> that he enforces to the letter, ranging from "No littering" to "No killing more than two people at once".

Because the rules state that if the correct person is voted guilty in a trial, they <em>alone</em> will die, letting Fuyuhiko die would be a violation, thus Monokuma has to allow him to survive.

Neremus refuses to be intimidated:
<div class="indent"><strong>Neremus:</strong> If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times. The Chapel of St. Martin does not violate the terms of the White-Gold Concordat. There is no Talos worship going on here. <br/><strong>Armion:</strong> It violates the spirit of the White-Gold Concordat. I must urge you to cease and desist at once. <br/><strong>Neremus:</strong> Oh? What is "the spirit" of the White-Gold Concordat? <br/><strong>Armion:</strong> The spirit of the White-Gold Concordat is that men are not, and can never be, gods. Just as Tiber Septim is not a god, nor is Martin Septim. <br/><strong>Neremus:</strong> But what does the Concordat actually say? <br/><strong>Armion:</strong> The Concordat forbids Talos worship. <br/><strong>Neremus:</strong> No mention of Martin Septim worship, though? <br/><strong>Armion:</strong> I... no, there isn't. I must consult with my superiors. Perhaps we will have to petition for a slight amendment to some... unfortunately specific wording within the Concordat.
</div><ul><li> Even then, Neremus is even more in the right from the fact that Martin Septim isn't actually worshipped as a god, but as a <em>saint</em> of Akatosh, the perfectly legal god Martin was a priest of.

<ul><li> Debaters will, on occasion, delve into arguing about the process and rules of debate itself rather than the topic (either because they have no evidence that is on-topic to the specific case their opponent is running, or because they simply dislike the topic itself). The judges of a debate are <em>supposed</em> to score this tactic down, but being sufficiently audacious, amusing, or clever at it can earn their mercy.
<ul><li> In the specific subdiscipline of policy debate, this is so highly developed, several of these arguments are taught as standard. The most common is Topicality: The Affirmative (the guys proposing a solution to the official problem, called the resolution) are actually off-topic. This usually rests on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKeepUsingThatWord">abuse of the dictionary</a>, but if the Negative (the guys trying to shoot the Affirmative down) can prove it and convince the judge that it's worthwhile to consider, they win: if the Affirmative is off-topic, then they haven't "Affirmed" the resolution, and thus failed. Weird enough for ya? Other rules-lawyer arguments (called "Theory" in the jargon) are <em>weirder</em>. Somebody once nearly <em>won</em> by arguing they should <em>lose</em> and then backing it up with cogent arguments on theory; they only lost because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">they actually were trying to throw the round</a>, and brought in a different argument to ensure defeat.
</li><li> Thankfully not allowed in debates with the "World Schools" (three speakers per side, with one making two speeches) and "British Parliamentary" (four speakers per side, one speech each) formats, where the rules and conventions are very clearly defined and rules-lawyering or breaking will get you marked down by the judge.

This often leads to lengthy objection battles, particularly when introducing evidence and putting it on the record. If they're poor at tactics (or checking the clock), the Rules Lawyer can ruin everyone's day by making the trial run over the allotted time, which results in a loss for both teams regardless of how they are doing in the trial.

So he prorogued Parliament, preventing the vote.

A full year before the Emancipation Proclamation, he made it policy to never return runaway slaves who made it into Union lines. It was a sort of "emancipation lite" for the area. When Butler was scolded for playing with the political powder keg of slavery, he logically, and with tongue-planted-firmly-in-cheek pointed out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">slaves were no more than animals</a>, and like any animal being used by the enemy, were legitimate contrabands of war. The ex-slaves stayed in Union lines, often took paid jobs, and got a basic education. This logic was eventually adopted by the whole Union Army and was made general policy in the Emancipation Proclamation. Yes, <em>this</em> is what Lincoln's famous freeing of the slaves is based on: rules-lawyering. (Everyone forgets this, but before he was a politician, Lincoln was a top-flight and very successful lawyer.) It also made this massive change easier to swallow in the slave states that stayed in the Union.
<ul><li> It's often said that since the Emancipation Proclamation only applied to slaves in states that had seceded (so as not to offend loyal slave states) it freed exactly no one at its time of issuance. This is not precisely true; the Union Army already held substantial swaths of Southern territory—including the Confederacy's largest city, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewOrleans">New Orleans</a>—and in areas where the Union commanders hadn't already done what Butler had started doing, the slaves were freed. On the other hand, it is true that most slaves freed by the Proclamation were freed after it came into effect.
</li></ul></li><li> The Westboro Baptist Church mixes this trope with a fair amount of cherry-picking to justify its founder's hatred for Jews, homosexuals, and pretty much every sentient being that is not part of the church.

</li><li> Henry "Smokey" Yunick was the king of this trope in NASCAR. He did everything from lowering the roof of the car (to improve the aerodynamics) to using an 11-foot coil of 2-inch tubing in lieu of a standard fuel line (to add 5 gallons of gas to the car's capacity). His reasoning was that everyone else was cheating at least 10 times as hard as his crew was, so it was self-defense.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">American tax protesters</a> often attempt this trope with &lt;ahem&gt; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">non-standard</a></em> readings of many laws, such as claiming that their salary is not "income" since it is only paper money and not gold or silver, or that the tax bill is for JOHN DOE, who is a totally different person from John Doe. The most famous being that paying income taxes is optional because the U.S. code uses the word "voluntary" to refer to the system. In this case, though, "voluntary" does not mean "optional"; it means "You are going to volunteer (i.e. provide) your information to us. The IRS is not going to compute your taxes for you and send you a bill. You have to do your own paperwork."
<ul><li> Similarly, the 'birther' movement surrounding Barack Obama's eligibility for the presidency. Most of the movement centred the argument around his birth certificate and the claim that he wasn't born in the United States. When Obama produced his birth certificate, they largely either backed down or claimed the certificate was a fake. But an even more extreme section of the movement insisted that the birth certificate was irrelevant because according to the constitution a president must be a <em>natural-born</em> citizen, whereas Obama is only a <em>native-born</em> citizen (yes, legally these are different things). This is apparently because Obama's father was from Kenya, then a British colony, and British law at the time said that all colonial subjects and their children were British citizens. Apart from this not in any way affecting Obama's US citizenship (as many people have joint nationality), Britain retroactively repealed the British citizenship of colonial subjects after those colonies became independent (unless they were eligible for British citizenship on other grounds, which neither Obama nor his father was). However, the definition of natural born as used in the US constitution is not universally agreed on and has never been addressed by the US Supreme Court. It is not likely they will ever touch that subject with a 10-foot birth certificate.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts">civil suits in the United States</a>, jury verdicts in cases where the dispute is over something exceeding a given dollar value are not typically subject to judicial review. However, there is a type of judgment called "judgment notwithstanding the verdict", which requires that a motion for judgment as a matter of law had been filed and denied during the trial. The logic behind judgment notwithstanding the verdict is that it is not a reexamination of the verdict, but rather of the previously-rejected motion. Judges like this for varying reasons, not least of which is ass-covering: they will often deny a motion for judgment as a matter of law during the trial even if he/she has already made up his/her mind that the law is clear and that one side should win. If the jury's verdict is in favor of the party that the judge thinks should win, the opposing party's motion after the verdict will be denied. If the verdict goes the other way, though, the judge will simply grant the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. This means that the judge gets the result he/she thinks is right no matter what, but also gets the advantage that if the jury finds for the side the judge was going to rule for, it has the added legitimacy and finality of a jury verdict.

In 1946, NFL teams were barred from signing UCLA star player Kenny Washington, due to segregation (George Halas and the Chicago Bears first among them). Then the Cleveland Rams - who were about to become the Los Angeles Rams and wanted to sign the local star Washington - used the very law that established Segregation (Plessy v. Ferguson) to force the league to allow them to sign Washington. When they were about to move into to the LA Colosseum (a publicly-funded stadium), Rams officials asked when the accompanying blacks-only stadium would be built. Since that wasn't about to happen, and the law said there had to be an equivalent organization to justify the exclusion (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> and the Negro Leagues), the NFL couldn't use the law to enforce their own segregation policy (unless they wanted to start a full Negro Football League).
