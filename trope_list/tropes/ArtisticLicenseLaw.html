</div></div><p>This is a listing of liberties taken with how the law is presented for entertainment.
</p><p>Real litigation or prosecution takes months, not minutes, and almost none of it happens in court. Watching lawyers read mountains of documents and write briefs doesn't make for an enjoyable show, so creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail">modify the process</a> to be entertaining to the audience. This causes the legal procedures portrayed in fiction to have little to no correlation with how the process would go down in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Laws varies from country to country and between jurisdictions. What may seem like an inaccurate portrayl of the legal process by residents of one region may actually be valid legal procedure in another, and vice versa. (This is common in historical works as most legal systems have been fine-tuned over centuries. Go back 200 years and chances are court procedures are comparatively sloppy.) As with all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">Acceptable Breaks from Reality</a>, examples can become particularly egregious, especially when it's the substance of the law, not the procedure, that the creators are obfuscating.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbominationAccusationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbominationAccusationAttack">Abomination Accusation Attack</a>: Making these is a great way to find yourself receiving a cease-and-desist from the other party's attorney, and if you don't back off or they can demonstrate that they suffered economic harm as the result of inflammatory falsehoods, you have a good shot at finding yourself on the wrong end of a defamation suit.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">Accidental Marriage</a>: In the US, if you didn't freely consent to a marriage, it's not a legal marriage and can easily be annulled before a judge.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbulanceChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbulanceChaser">Ambulance Chaser</a>: In some jurisdictions (such as Europe), being one of these is illegal. Even places where it's legal still take a very dim view of this. Taking a worthless case just to shake someone down with a scary letter and make them panic-settle may, at the very least, net you an envelope in the mail with a none-too-polite letter from their attorney. The same goes for representing clients in an overly aggressive, belligerent, and uncivil manner; taking a no-holds-barred, scorched-earth approach to representation is a great way to lose cases, get sued for malpractice, and, again, find yourself on the wrong end of a smackdown from a pissed-off judge or state bar association.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">Amoral Attorney</a>: Attorneys are supposed to be <em>impartial</em> and give all clients the best representation that they can possibly provide. A criminal defense attorney will tell you that providing the best possible representation to the worst people serves a twofold purpose: it keeps the police and prosecution honest and forces them to do things by the book, and it eliminates the possibility of any sort of successful appeal from the defendant. If they absolutely cannot represent a client in good faith, they have an ethical and legal obligation to relieve themselves of their duty. The level of moral bankruptcy that is often seen in fiction would cause most attorneys to be disbarred, or even arrested, a <em>long</em> time ago.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChildLaborLaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseChildLaborLaws">Artistic License  Child Labor Laws</a>: When kids in fiction work despite being too young.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BailEqualsFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BailEqualsFreedom">Bail Equals Freedom</a>: Bail is treated as an easy way to skip a future trial and possible sentencing. In real life, it's a monetary guarantee that the accused will show up for trial and "jumping bail" is a crime in itself. Flight risks or those who pose a clear and present threat to the community will generally not be granted bail, and additional conditions may be attached depending on the nature of the charges; no-contact orders, curfews, travel restrictions, and substance restrictions are all fairly common ones.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a>: While you sometimes have a case if this happens in real life, the standards for a successful claim are much higher than in fiction. They <em>must</em> be offering an enticing product or service that they don't actually have so they can sell a similar, but lower-quality product or service - if they actually have the product, or ran out but offer rainchecks or indicate that it's first-come, first-serve, you probably don't have a case. Same goes for the concept of "promissory estoppel" (a court forcing one party to hold up their end of an agreement that they had withdrawn). It comes up a lot in employment situations and commercial services, and the standards are <em>very</em> high - for a successful promissory estoppel request, you have to have sunk a significant amount of time, money, and resources into something that you had every reason to believe was a done deal, only to have it arbitrarily withdrawn and for you to be in a much worse place than you were when you started (e.g., you moved across the country for a job you were offered and bought a house near the job, only for the offer to be withdrawn at the last minute).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareOfViciousDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareOfViciousDog">Beware of Vicious Dog</a>: In real life, a poorly-behaved dog that attacks members of the public unprovoked can usually cause the owner to be fined and/or ordered to control or relinquish the dog, as well as being opened up to civil liability for any injuries or property damage caused by the dog. If the dog is still a problem, or if it <em>really</em> does serious harm to someone, the dog may be euthanized.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bouncer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bouncer">Bouncer</a>: A necessity for any establishment serving alcohol in real life, but carrying out your duties by being a rude, violent jerk will get you fired from basically any place you'd want to work at. Being aggressive or needlessly violent (which is what you're supposed to <em>not</em> be) will get you fired swiftly and likely sued or arrested, while being a dick to people will also get you fired when word gets out to your coworkers that you piss off customers and make bad situations worse every time you open your mouth. While you <em>are</em> expected to be able to handle yourself when things go south, your verbal conflict mitigation and resolution skills are prioritized above all else. As anyone who has worked in nightlife can tell you, there are plenty of thugs and bullies behind the velvet rope, but your job is to prevent or stop trouble and help people, not look intimidating and beat up troublemakers, and the dudes who go into the job expecting to kick some ass are the dudes who quickly find themselves unable to find work anywhere that isn't disreputable or dysfunctional.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChalkOutline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChalkOutline">Chalk Outline</a>: Might have been occasionally used in the distant past before cameras, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">not used at all any more thanks to more advanced technology</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense">Chewbacca Defense</a>: Creative or unorthodox tactics have a place in law. Frivolous and/or sophistic ones do not. A good judge will tell an attorney who is using one to quit wasting the court's time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitizenshipMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CitizenshipMarriage">Citizenship Marriage</a>: Just because you marry someone from another country doesn't mean you automatically become a citizen of that country— at best, it reduces the time it takes to become a naturalized citizen. Immigration authorities are quite wise to the usual green card/sham marriage tricks.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0f7c8');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0f7c8" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0f7c8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Children may be considered to be citizens of whichever country they were born in, depending on the citizenship law of the country, but that doesn't mean the immigrant parent(s) automatically become citizens.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction">Conviction by Contradiction</a>: While a legal case has to hold together logically to some extent, "logic dictates that this must be what happened" is <em>not</em> sufficient for a conviction in a criminal case. In a <em>civil</em> case, the principle of <em>res ipsa loquitur</em> (the thing speaks for itself) applies, and it basically amounts to "we can't conclusively prove just <em>how</em> this occurred, but there is simply no explanation that does not open the defendant up to liability" (e.g., a section of pallet racking collapses and crushes an employee; whatever the reason may be, properly maintained and loaded pallet racks are not supposed to suddenly collapse on people). Furthermore, an investigation that seems may be running solely on the fact someone used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificTense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificTense">the wrong grammar</a> on his statement as "<strong>the</strong> clue" (to give an example, but equally flimsy things have been used in fiction) would probably be dismissed as harassment.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByCounterfactualClue">Conviction by Counterfactual Clue</a>: A defendant's statement, testimony, or alibi, or a witness's testimony is not automatically and completely discredited just because it contains one item that isn't absolutely true. Trials in some places happen months or even years after the fact, depending on the crime. In that time, details can very easily become fuzzy in a person's memory.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopsNeedTheVigilante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopsNeedTheVigilante">Cops Need the Vigilante</a>: Law enforcement officers and agencies cannot hire or use a civilian to circumvent their own rules.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtroomAntic">Courtroom Antic</a>: Many of these common in fiction would result in the lawyer being warned, and possibly removed from the case or punished for contempt of court. Major antics could be cause for the verdict to be overturned on appeal (See "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">Off on a Technicality</a>") or could cause the judge to declare a mistrial, and a consistently ill-behaved lawyer would risk disbarment. While the courts tend to be a little more lenient with <em>pro se</em> litigants<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1q8y7');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1q8y7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1q8y7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">representing yourself in court</span>, being disruptive, verbally abusive, or aggressive will still result in the court telling you to knock it off, and habitual bad behavior in the courtroom, when combined with a lengthy, well-established track record of abusive <em>pro se</em> litigation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> to evade consequences, presents a strong case for being declared a vexatious litigant. Lastly, if a client vehemently insists on trying something incredibly stupid and poorly-reasoned despite their attorney's attempts to talk them out of it, they will usually be allowed by their attorney to directly address the court, which is <em>usually</em> courtroom code for "my client is a moron and I tried many times to get them to not do this, but they wouldn't budge, and I take zero responsibility for anything they may say to sabotage their case".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense">Crime of Self-Defense</a>: What is and is not "self-defense" is complicated and thorny legal ground, and varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally speaking, self-defense claims require that the threat instigated the event or massively escalated it, you weren't able to get away, you only used the amount of force necessary to remove the threat, and immediately stopped once the threat was gone. And even that only <em>might</em> work. Telling the nice police officer "But it was self-defense!" won't keep you out of court<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09osk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note09osk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09osk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In most Commonwealth and US jurisdictions, self-defense is an 'affirmative defense' - the defendant in effect has to admit technical guilt, and then argue that it was a justifiable action despite this. Few lawyers, especially in the US, want to ever go with something that involves the client being 'guilty until proven justified', for obvious reasons.</span>, and it is most certainly <em>not</em> a defense to things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrookedContractor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrookedContractor">Crooked Contractor</a>: There are plenty of them in real life, and they are often just as hard to permanently get rid of (shady contractors dissolving, laying low, then resurfacing as a new business entity in a year or so are <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, and getting money out of them is usually just as hard as it is in fiction due to their tendency to be judgment-proof due to minimal assets and the inherent difficulty of even tracking them down), but many jurisdictions have funds set up to help reimburse people who were done dirty by a contractor who they realistically will never get money from. Larger business entities also have a responsibility to vet prospective contractors and subcontractors, and requesting accident and environmental hazard records is a standard part of due diligence in those scenarios<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ewik');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ewik" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ewik');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though only up to a certain point; if you hire a contractor with a spotty record who you were told to not hire and they cause a massive explosion or dump a bunch of toxic waste into a river, they're coming for your ass. On the other hand, hiring a decent contractor, who then hires a decent subcontractor, who in turn hires two unlicensed guys in a pickup truck they met outside of a supply shop who proceed to use dynamite to blow up an old section of pipes covered in asbestos without your knowledge is something that you're probably in the clear on, since there's no reasonable way you could have foreseen an issue with that many levels of separation</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">Department of Child Disservices</a>: Family courts and child services hate to separate children from their parents permanently. The mandate of social services is not to <em>punish</em> the parents, but to <em>rehabilitate</em> the family. While they may remove children from a household temporarily, it is usually only until the parents can clean up their act to make the household suitable for the children again. A permanent separation only occurs when the parents are truly unfit and present a clear and present danger to the children.
<ul><li> While real-life agencies probably get just as many false reports as they do in fiction (if not more), agents are trained extensively in how to detect false reports. While they are required to investigate them, the typical sources of false reports (angry exes and their families and friends in divorces or custody battles, crazy, vengeful family members, ex-friends or neighbors, or children with certain mental illnesses) will lead to agents to approach the case with the assumption that it is unsubstantiated.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity">Diplomatic Impunity</a>: Real-life abuses of it definitely occur, but any nation that values its relationship with the host country <em>will</em> deal with it. International incidents,especially serious criminal offenses, do not foster goodwill, The host can always declare the offender "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonaNonGrata">Persona Non Grata</a>" (or, in layman's terms, "you must leave and never return"). Matters can be complicated in cases where the offender has committed an offense that is treated far more harshly in the sending country.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneylandDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneylandDad">Disneyland Dad</a>: Non-custodial parents deliberately spoiling their kids, letting them do whatever they want when they visit, or not following through on restrictions or punishments that the custodial parent had instituted just to undermine the custodial parent falls under the mantle of "parental alienation". Judges are wise to it and very quick to tell you to knock it off and/or find you in contempt if you do not comply.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisregardThatStatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisregardThatStatement">Disregard That Statement</a>: There are types of questions an attorney simply may not ask a witness in court. There are types of statements a trial attorney may not make in court. Asking such questions or making such statements deliberately, then backing down from it with "Disregard that" or "Withdrawn" is a risky tactic for a trial lawyer. The courts do have the power to sanction a lawyer who does this excessively or blatantly, not to mention the risk of creating something appeal-worthy; even <em>one</em> of these can lead to a successful appeal for allowing a jury to become unduly prejudiced, since asking or making an extremely loaded or leading question or statement simply cannot be unheard by a jury. As a rule, the sort of things that get said in fiction would get most lawyers in a world of hurt.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceAssetsConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceAssetsConflict">Divorce Assets Conflict</a>: Divorce has a way of bringing out the absolute worst in people, but the scorched-earth behavior that is often seen in fiction can and will lead to sanctions against both the offending party and their attorney. Your attorney's job is to advocate for your interests financially, <em>not</em> help you wage war on your ex-spouse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrFeelgood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrFeelgood">Dr. Feelgood</a>: Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, particularly in locales with limited or nonexistent restrictions and transparency related to prescription medicines, or with corrupt monitoring authorities, but many jurisdictions have very strict oversight over the prescribing of medications known to be recreationally abused, and even <em>one</em> overdose from recreationally abused prescription medication (especially opioids) can bring down the wrath of government authorities and end a doctor's career if it is tied to a prescription they wrote.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis">Eagleland Osmosis</a>: People in every country have seen a lot of American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawProcedural">Law Procedurals</a>, and often assume the law works similarly when making one set in their own country.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmancipatedChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmancipatedChild">Emancipated Child</a>: Less common and more difficult to obtain than TV would have you believe. There has to be evidence that the parents are unfit to take care of them, that there are no relatives willing or able to act as legal guardians, that they are sufficiently mature and capable of making good decisions, and that the child can reasonably support themselves (meaning that they can demonstrate that they are currently financially self-sufficient and will continue to be, as well as being unlikely to apply for welfare or resort to illegal sources of income.) They will <em>not</em> be granted custody of younger siblings at the same time, unless circumstances are well and truly bizarre.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">Enfante Terrible</a>: Out-of-control children who consistently resist all attempts at parental direction, habitually run away and/or are truant, and are involved in wantonly self-destructive, violent, or criminal behavior can be subject to a child in need of supervision (CHINS) petition (nomenclature may differ depending on the locale), which gets family services involved and typically starts with family counseling and community-based care. Incorrigibility petitions exist in some jurisdictions, and those are for more severe cases - if a child is successfully declared incorrigible, they pose a clear, present, and immediate danger to themselves or others, or are so disruptive that they create an unsafe environment for others.

Nowadays, while it's still done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">some police forces</a>, the cops know very well that it's illegal and will move heaven and earth to keep it out of the courthouse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDebtCollector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilDebtCollector">Evil Debt Collector</a>: Collections is a heavily regulated industry, and the actions agencies can take are heavily controlled.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedExecutionNoSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedExecutionNoSentence">Failed Execution, No Sentence</a>: There used to be a time when people surviving an execution (or a set amount of execution attempts, such as being hanged three times) were given a full pardon, being seen as God's will. More recently (talking at least a hundred-plus years or so), this was started to be seen as a no-no (this is why any execution sentencing will have the judge saying that the method will be applied "until (the prisoner is) dead"). Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionIsntFair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionIsntFair">Fiction Isn't Fair</a> and not only does this code lives on, but sometimes will be presented in a sillier fashion.

At the time of that ruling, the court reasoned you didn't have a right to free speech if what you say could cause a reasonable person to retaliate with force. However, the scope of the law has been drastically narrowed in the years following. Terminiello v City of Chicago ruled seven years later that the purpose of free speech was to invite dispute, even if it incited people to anger. Cohen v California then narrowed the definition of "fighting words" to any speech that was <em>inherently</em> likely to invoke a violent reaction, not just words that might make a reasonable person want to hit you. Gooding v Wilson then determined that speech which was simply vulgar or offensive was protected under the first amendment (during a case which involved the defendant <em>threatening to choke a police officer</em> no less). Finally, Brandenburg v Ohio ruled that in order for "fighting words" to be outside first amendment protections, it has to have the intent to incite violence and that violence must be <em>imminent and likely to happen.</em> So no, you are not legally justified in punching someone for "hate speech" (a legal term that's already hard to define) under this doctrine.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFoolForAClient">A Fool for a Client</a>: Representing oneself <em>pro se</em> is generally a really bad idea, but there is little truth to the notion that all <em>pro se</em> litigants are either crazy or have no case. Most are just people of limited means trying to resolve a problem to the best of their ability. Crazies and bullies exist, but they do not represent the majority of <em>pro se</em> litigants. Also, courts recognize that a good <em>pro se</em> litigant is trying to resolve their issue, and generally work with them or take it easy on them. Criminal defense is rather different, however. While misdemeanors are regularly handled <em>pro se</em> unless there is a procedural dispute<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2x4zp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2x4zp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2x4zp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">though it is often sensible to get some sort of formal legal advice anyway, if not necessarily courtroom defense, even if you mean to plead no contest - the real reason it is foolish here is that you may not understand the ramifications of the charge, and while for things like moving violations the cost of an actual defense would be more than the penalty would come to, legal counsel is <em>always</em> an option, and usually a wise move</span>, in many jurisdictions in the US, <em>pro se</em> defense for a <strong>felony</strong> requires the judge to explicitly allow the defendant to go without legal counsel, before proceedings commence, and the rules for permitting it grows ever more strict as the severity of the crime increases (this is counter-balanced by the Miranda rule requiring the state to provide a public defender if the defendant cannot afford private counsel). It is nearly impossible to get a judge to permit a <em>pro se</em> defense in a murder or rape case. Furthermore, the Bar Association in most states outright prohibits a current or former lawyer from defending themselves in such a case and will penalize (or even disbar) a standing officer of the court for even requesting it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>: In fiction, defense attorneys have a pretty good track record with getting clients off incredibly light or getting them off completely by using a deeply painful or abusive childhood or a generally terrible life as a defense for why they did what they did. In real life, courts don't really care about how shitty your childhood was or how much your life sucks— they just care about what you are accused of doing. If it <em>does</em> come up, it's usually during sentencing, though it can also affect flimsier charges (usually by invalidating the intent portion) and may also be a factor for competency evaluations and/or insanity pleas, as people who have been so warped by trauma as to become fundamentally divorced from reality may present a compelling case for an insanity plea or incompetence finding.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">Frivolous Lawsuit</a>: Lawyers are required by law to make a reasonable inquiry into the factual and legal merit of every case before filing, in order to reasonably ensure that it is legitimate. Of they fail to do so, they can face sanctions, up to and including disbarment if they have a long and steady history of accepting worthless cases and have not learned their lesson from multiple previous run-ins with the state bar association and angry judges. If an apparently worthless case is taken, then it likely either had enough factual and legal merit (that may not be readily apparent) to justify accepting it, or the client lied or grossly misrepresented important details. If the client <em>did</em> lie or embellish details, it is the attorney's responsibility to cease representation as soon as they learn of the deception. Repeatedly filing these as a <em>pro se</em> litigant is also a great way to be declared a vexatious litigant, which doesn't bar you from filing so much as it makes it incredibly difficult and expensive to do so as a way of curbing a lengthy, well-established pattern of abuse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a>: This is what prenuptial agreements are for.

How much they can get away with depends on the circumstances. Unreasonably harsh or arbitrary sentences, sentences motivated by prejudice, or outright illegal sentences? Guaranteed appeal, and the judge can face consequences all the way up to being removed from the bench in the case of truly egregious misconduct (though never as a first resort). The judge watching you enter the courtroom in filthy ripped jeans and a vulgar novelty shirt from Spencer Gifts for the same thing that you've gotten into trouble for many times before, then taking a look at your rap sheet, noticing that you have been getting into trouble with the law almost nonstop from the time you turned eighteen, have multiple serious offenses on your record, and have clearly not learned a single thing from any of those experiences, and deciding to hurl the book at you? Nope, you're probably not going to get anywhere with appealing that.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense">Insanity Defense</a>: In real life, <em>if</em> an insanity defense works, the defendant doesn't walk out of court a free person. They walk out of court in the company of a couple of burly orderlies from a mental institution. Whether they ever walk out of <em>there</em> a free person depends on the psychiatrists and psychologists. Their stay can very well be longer than what their prison sentence would have been. Also, an insanity defense is only used in less than 1% of US criminal trials and is successful ~25% of the time. That's less than one-quarter of one one-hundredth of criminal cases that it works. If it seems like it happens more often, that's because it's so rare and risky that it garners more attention when someone attempts it. Note that this has nothing to do with legal competence; being adjudicated incompetent is an entirely different matter, though it often follows that someone who is legally incompetent is likely also criminally incompetent.
<ul><li> Likewise, being judged legally incompetent to stand trial is <em>not</em> the same as being not guilty by reason of insanity. For starters, one doesn't have to be "insane"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3quvo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3quvo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3quvo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which incidentally is a legal term, not a medical one: a mentally ill person is not by default legally insane, nor does a legally insane person have to be diagnosed with a mental illness</span> to be found incompetent to stand trial. Moreover, a person declared incompetent doesn't get out of standing trial: they are removed to a psychiatric facility and rehabilitated (and often medicated) to the minimum of competency, at which point the trial continues. <em>This can happen multiple times during the course of a trial.</em> If a person decompensates (i.e., reverts to being incompetent) during the course of a trial, the trial is suspended and the person returned to a hospital until they can continue. In most jurisdictions, the standards of legal competency are astonishingly low, often involving simply being able to identify one's lawyer, knowing which person in the courtroom is the judge, and understanding what will happen if one is found guilty...information that most people — including children, persons with advanced dementia, people suffering from psychosis, and the intellectually challenged — have absorbed simply through watching television. In short: you're not getting out of this trial, and if you somehow <em>do</em>, you probably were not able to function on a daily basis without extensive aid, to begin with.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsuranceFraud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsuranceFraud">Insurance Fraud</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealEstateScam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealEstateScam">Real Estate Scam</a>: They happen, but real-life insurance and fair-housing investigators are <em>much</em> wiser to the usual tricks than fictional ones tend to be. Fictional examples are largely based on either exceptional cases, or early cases from before the insurance companies wised up.
<ul><li> The incidence, and success, of such cases often varies wildly by jurisdiction, especially in what used to called the Second and Third World nations - for example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StagedPedestrianAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StagedPedestrianAccident">Staged Pedestrian Accidents</a> and other vehicular scams became a serious problem in Russia in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which led to the widespread adoption of dashcams. Note, however, that the crux of most such scams is to get the victim to make an immediate payoff in order to <em>avoid</em> involving the troubled, underfunded, and often corrupt police and court systems in the areas hardest hit by post-Cold War economic downturns. This seems to have eased since 2010 or so, but at the same time, it has grown more common in other countries such as Vietnam, Brazil, and the Philippines as their economies rapidly change.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideNotMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideNotMurder">Arranging one's suicide to look like murder or an accident</a> in order to provide one's beneficiaries with a hefty insurance payout is, uh, less necessary than fiction would make it seem. It is a common misconception that insurance companies <em>never</em> pay out in the case of suicide — a misconception that most insurers don't put a lot of effort into correcting, for obvious reasons. However, most term-life policies have a suicide clause of anywhere from two to five years in order to prevent people from taking out enormous policies and killing themselves immediately afterwards, both as a method of preventing fraud and as a suicide deterrent. After the clause expires, insurers are legally required to pay the full policy amount even if the insured person is known to have committed suicide. Obviously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Suicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Suicide">suicide is never recommended</a>, even for the purpose of defrauding a financial institution.
</li><li> Back in the day, insurance fraud was <em>much</em> simpler: take out a policy on any random item (or person) whether or not it was yours, then destroy the item (or person) and collect. Many serial killers (such as Belle Gunness and H.H. Holmes) began their murderous careers in just this way. For this very reason, all insurance companies now require proof of <em>insurable interest</em> — that is, reasonable proof that you have a legitimate interest in the continued existence of this object (your house) or person (your spouse) and would suffer a genuine loss if anything should happen to them (i.e. your house burns down and you have nowhere else to live; the loss of your spouse significantly impacts your life and/or income). Likewise, for this reason, one must be able to prove ownership of the insured item or have the insured person verify that they are aware that you have taken out a policy on their behalf. Often they have to verify this while in the presence of an insurance agent so that there can be no forged signatures or having one's spouse sign a policy while believing it's something else. In short: the insurance companies are on to all those would-be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bluebeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bluebeard">Bluebeards</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">black widows</a> and have made it increasingly difficult to insure someone without their knowledge or consent. While modern crime writers should bear this in mind, the lax laws of the past might still allow historical writers to get away with (fictional) murder depending on their time period.
<ul><li> There's one major exception to the above: a parent is legally able to take out a policy on their underage child without the child's knowledge or consent. In fiction, this is portrayed as highly remarkable and a sure sign of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">Offing the Offspring</a>, particularly when a parent insures an infant. In real life, it's actually very common to insure babies, for a lot of practical, non-murderous reasons. Ironically, the most common reason is in case the child <em>does</em> die young, in order to cover the cost of an unanticipated funeral. But young, healthy children are very cheap to insure, and insuring them early may allow them to maintain lower premiums even after they're grown. Moreover, by the time the child reaches adulthood, the policy may have "paid up," allowing the child to cash it in or maintain it without paying further premiums. Whatever the motive, taking out insurance on a child doesn't raise any automatic red flags with either insurers or law enforcement.

In Western countries, torturing a suspect is generally illegal and any information thereby obtained is inadmissible in court, which is codified in the United States under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution (which does not mean it never happens, only that it generally means the case is going to get thrown out if discovered). There are ways they can still secure a conviction, but if word gets out, they can expect <strong>a lot</strong> of public outcry.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustJokingJustification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustJokingJustification">"Just Joking" Justification</a>: Varies. "I was kidding", "it's hyperbole", or "it's social commentary" are not acceptable defenses for genuinely defamatory statements; while the burden of proof is higher for public figures due to parody and satire protections, no judge is going to accept a hasty take-back to a defamatory statement ("Bob is a child rapist - whoops, haha, I'm just playing") as anything other than a transparent ruse to escape accountability, but if most reasonable people would clearly infer that it was in jest or you were making a satirical dig, the other party doesn't have a case.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">Kick the Son of a Bitch</a>: Courts frankly don't give a shit about how much your victim deserved what was coming to them, and impersonal malice as opposed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">deliberately targeting bad people</a> may honestly be more in your favor, as it presents a less compelling case for premeditation. Ask anyone who has worked in criminal justice for any meaningful amount of time and they will tell you that a significant amount of violent crime victims are just as bad as the people who victimized them, and they'll also tell you that no, it usually doesn't make a meaningful difference.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaxativePrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaxativePrank">Laxative Prank</a>: This counts as criminal poisoning in many jurisdictions, and is also extremely likely to get you sued for any and all resulting damages. The results of deliberately tricking someone into ingesting laxatives are not at all funny - sure, they may have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyEmergency">Potty Emergency</a>, but they are also quite likely to wind up in the hospital with anything from severe dehydration to, in extreme cases, a ruptured bowel or severe gastrointestinal bleeding, both of which are life-threatening events. If you leave out a trap for a coworker or roommate who keeps stealing your food or bake them into brownies to present to someone who you don't like or want to prank, odds are pretty good that you will be facing serious criminal charges or get a judgment entered against you.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeonineContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeonineContract">Leonine Contract</a>: Varies considerably by jurisdiction, but in general contracts that have 'unconscionable' terms and conditions (such as forcing the signer to become a literal life-long slave of whoever owns the document) are considered unenforceable.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>: Courts do indeed hate that one weird trick, but odds are good that a). someone tried it or something similar before and you're not as clever as you think you are, and b). the loophole was closed via case law or, barring that, an amendment to the relevant statutory law. Furthermore, trying to exploit loopholes to get away with bad behavior or evade consequences is a great way to piss off the court or the other side and ensure that they come down on you even harder (if they can) or go out of their way to get you for whatever they can (if they can't get you for that specific thing).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass">Made Out to Be a Jerkass</a>: A very risky move on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> court of law. Even the biggest jerk in the galaxy can have an actual legal grievance, so trying to redirect the blame to make the plaintiff look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">an asshole that deserves whatever crime he was a victim of</a> just makes the defendant look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>—also, this is why juries are instructed and screened to try to keep bias out of the equation (although it doesn't always succeed). It can also actually be a defense in defamation cases; if the plaintiff's reputation is already so terrible that there's no more damage that can realistically be done, the "actual harm" portion of most defamation statutes may be impossible to satisfy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MattressTagGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MattressTagGag">Mattress Tag Gag</a>: It's only illegal to rip the tag of a mattress or pillow if you are a seller or manufacturer of that mattress or pillow. For your average, everyday non-mattress-vendor person to do it, it's perfectly legal, and there are no consequences. (Even for the vendor, it's more likely to result in a fine than anything else, and certainly not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongerThanLifeSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongerThanLifeSentence">Longer-Than-Life Sentence</a> or anything crazy like that.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveEqualsConclusiveEvidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveEqualsConclusiveEvidence">Motive = Conclusive Evidence</a>: Having a reason to commit the crime is not enough evidence to put you in jail nor for the investigators to stop looking for answers. Investigators have seen it all, and they are very willing to accept that someone with every reason to commit the crime in question may not have done it and vice versa, and that people will commit crimes for stupid, nonsensical, or bizarre reasons or for no reason whatsoever, and quite likely may have done it as a spur-of-the-moment impulsive act that they didn't think through or even think about period. It is the prosecution and defense that like motives, as they help build a narrative for why someone did or did not commit the crime that they are accused of.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSimulators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSimulators">Murder Simulators</a>: While people have been killed in the name of video games before, using the fact that a person played a violent video game (or had a history of playing them) is not enough to declare anyone mentally unfit or insane. Attempt to use it in court, and the judge will throw it out for being prejudicial when the other attorney inevitably objects.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustStateIfYoureACop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustStateIfYoureACop">Must State If You're a Cop</a>: Undercover officers have no obligation to inform criminals that they're police, even when asked about it point-blank. The idea that not stating they're a cop is "entrapment" is also false; entrapment is if a police officer has you commit an illegal act that you would not have done if the cop hadn't approached you. Asking this will just weaken your case should you be arrested, since it basically communicates that you knew full well what you were doing was a crime. It's also more likely the prosecutor will consider you a career criminal, rather than someone who broke the law once on a whim. The reason this trope still exists is that cops take advantage of this urban legend during their undercover sting operations. Cops aren't exactly in a hurry to correct someone if they think undercover cops "have to" say so.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAdequatePunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAdequatePunishment">No Adequate Punishment</a>: A law does not need to exist to punish a specific crime. As an example: In the aftermath of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a>, some defenders were arguing that there was no law to punish the genocides of Nazi Germany. It was ruled that it was still punishable, and the Nuremberg trials were made specifically to dole it out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBadgeNoProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBadgeNoProblem">No Badge? No Problem!</a>: In real life, the police take a very dim view of people acting like they have legal authority when their position does not give it. In this case what varies by jurisdiction is not <em>whether</em> you'll get in trouble for doing it, but <em>how deep</em> the trouble will be. Exceptions exist (namely citizen's arrest), but those are highly situational and afford you far fewer privileges than would normally be available to law enforcement.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">No OSHA Compliance</a>: The ridiculous situations seen in fiction would get a workplace slammed with fines <em>at the very least</em>, if not outright given a stop-work order or shut down on the spot, and most occupational health and safety agencies around the world have some sort of "egregious violator" standard to severely punish employers who flagrantly spurn health and safety standards, constantly get into trouble for serious issues that never get resolved, or have such a persistently high rate of serious injuries that they may as well not even have a health and safety program, and the penalties attached to that status are <em>usually</em> enough to cripple or destroy all but the largest of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega Corps</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotProven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotProven">Not Proven</a>: It's not enough for the police and prosecutors to say "well, who else could it have been?" — they have to have a sufficiently strong legal case against a specific person, built on admissible evidence and through witness testimony. In addition, in the United States, the burden of proof is on the prosecution, and it must be proven "beyond a reasonable doubt" that the defendant is guilty. In short, it's not "no one else could have done it;" it's "only this person could have done it, and here's why." Sort of subverted for civil cases, as "preponderance of the evidence" is the civil standard of proof and can generally be taken to mean "there's enough evidence to indicate that you're liable"; there <em>can</em> be a shadow of a doubt, but the evidence against you is strong enough that beyond maybe a few slightly contentious points, any real doubt is willful contrarianism.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWarrantNoProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWarrantNoProblem">No Warrant? No Problem!</a>: Varies by jurisdiction, but broadly speaking it is illegal in most jurisdictions (either barging into a house to obtain evidence without a warrant or stalking a suspect for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating">Perp Sweating</a>). On the other hand, most searches <em>are</em> made without a warrant, it's just that there needs to be a lawful reason the cops didn't get a warrant.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4lefq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4lefq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4lefq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> "In plain view" is one exception (e.g., the police came to your door for an unrelated matter and spotted bales of cocaine all over the kitchen table through the window), others include "hot pursuit" (e.g., chasing an armed robbery suspect on foot and spotting them ducking into a friend's residence and following them in), "exigent circumstances" (e.g., strongly suspecting that someone stole a gun to commit a crime, and not having the time to secure a search warrant before they commit it), and most commonly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">"consent"</a> (i.e., someone who was pulled over consenting to a search of their vehicle).</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">Off on a Technicality</a>: A case being "dismissed on a technicality" almost always means that the judge or jury <strong>wanted</strong> to acquit the defendant in the first place; in cases where the evidence against them was overwhelming, it is <em>usually</em> due to extreme police or prosecutorial misconduct that absolutely cannot be rewarded. A technicality will still <em>weaken</em> a case, but isn't enough to get a case dropped or a Not Guilty verdict on its own. Something severe enough to make or break a case on its own is, by definition, <em>not</em> a technicality.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5f8yn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5f8yn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5f8yn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some things which seem like technicalities at face value are not. A good example is when someone is guilty of Manslaughter but charged with Murder. That's <strong>not</strong> a technicality, that is prosecutorial misconduct. It looks like a technicality because they both involve someone being killed. But there is a wide chasm between a drunk idiot who accidentally hit a guy over the head too hard, and a psychopath who intentionally killed someone for fun.</span>
<ul><li> A commonly invoked mistake (when in the United States) is that the police did not remember to read the suspect their rights upon arresting. Reciting the "Miranda Rights" or "Miranda Warning" is only necessary for custodial interrogations, but it's usually given on arrest so it isn't forgotten later. If witness testimonies and/or physical evidence is sufficient for conviction, reading the suspect their rights is not necessary. Also, in the US the penalty for failing to Mirandize a suspect is that their testimony isn't admissible in court, not that they get a literal "get out of jail free" card. Furthermore, the "public safety" exception exists for Miranda, which holds that in narrow circumstances where someone poses a grave threat to the public, interrogations without a Miranda warning <em>may</em> be admissible. Furthermore, as many frustrated criminal defense attorneys will tell you, incriminating statements recorded over the jail phone (unless they are privileged communications, they <em>are</em> being recorded) are <em>not</em> covered under Miranda, and if your client confesses to everything or commits new crimes over the jail phone, there's nothing you can do about it. Same goes if they are properly read their rights, then keep talking and make incriminating statements after the fact; unless you can somehow make a case for coercion or duress (and, as most criminal defense attorneys will tell you, fat chance that you're going to pull that one off), there's no legal remedy for your client being too stupid to keep their mouth shut.
</li><li> Another common example is that a crucial piece of evidence being acquired illegally. Generally-speaking, rules against illegally-acquiring evidence are meant to prevent the police from conducting illegal search and seizure, and there are many exceptions to these rules. For example, in the United States evidence acquired by a private citizen and turned over to the police - even if acquired in the process of breaking the law - is admissible. Similarly, illegally-acquired evidence that would have been found later on anyway during a later, legal search and seizure, would be permitted.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryLawyer">Omnidisciplinary Lawyer</a>: As a general rule of thumb, in small towns, you'll find "country lawyers" who do a little of everything, for typically small stakes. For cases involving large sums of money or very complex, specialized areas of law, you'll want an attorney who specializes in that area, and in fact, most small-town lawyers will "tag-team" with a specialized lawyer to take a case to court. It's just like the difference between a general-practice physician and a specialized surgeon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePhoneCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnePhoneCall">One Phone Call</a>: In the US, you don't have to be given "one phone call". You have to be given a reasonable opportunity to get in touch with legal counsel. Criminal defense attorneys <em>wish</em> that they could eliminate the jail phone (calls from jail phones in most jurisdictions are recorded) for the same reason that prosecutors love it, however - you can prepare the best case that anyone could have prepared under the circumstances that will almost certainly get them off very lightly or completely, but if your client uses the jail phone and confesses to everything, threatens a witness, attempts to coordinate the destruction of evidence or false testimony from another party, or otherwise completely screws themselves over, there ain't a damn thing you can do about it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyBadGuysCallTheirLawyers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyBadGuysCallTheirLawyers">Only Bad Guys Call Their Lawyers</a>: If you've been charged with anything with consequences above a ticket, <em><strong>call your lawyer</strong></em>. You are always entitled to legal counsel, whether you have committed the crime you are accused of or not. Using that right does <em>not</em> make you look guilty by default, and having a lawyer present can protect you from a wide range of things.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnOneCondition">On One Condition</a>: Can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> up to a point, but particularly outlandish conditions and/or those that restrict the beneficiary from exercising a fundamental right or are otherwise against public policy are likely to be found invalid.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a>: Courts <em>hate</em> vigilantes and revenge stories and they're not going to give you a break just because your victim really had it coming. At best, it <em>may</em> serve as a mitigating factor during sentencing depending on how good a reason you had. At worst, it will result in an even harsher sentence, especially if what you did strike beyond the pale or if the prosecution can establish that you were just looking for a good excuse to seriously harm or kill someone. The jury <em>may</em> take pity on you, but it's probably best not to bet your freedom on it unless your lawyer thinks its an extremely good idea.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerryMasonMethod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerryMasonMethod">The Perry Mason Method</a>: The defense does not have to find the "real" culprit — to establish reasonable doubt, all a competent defense attorney needs to do is weaken the prosecution's case to "not proven" and/or posit another theory of events. Worse, this has been known to backfire, depending on the jury. Sometimes, even proving the guilt of another, even if it really <em>is</em> beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury may disregard it, on the grounds it doesn't truly contradict the evidence against the defendant. This is partly because there can be and often are cases where more than one person participated in the murder, but it's mostly that people will, correctly or otherwise, see this as misdirection and call Humbug.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaBargain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaBargain">Plea Bargain</a>: The reality varies widely by jurisdiction. In the US, where it's most common, the biggest difference between fact and fiction is when it's offered; in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, a plea bargain is almost never offered once the trial has begun. It is also usually offered when someone is accused of a (relatively) lesser offense that is simply not worth spending the time and money needed to fully prosecute them when there are bigger fish to fry; in other words, it's easier and cheaper to get the guy caught with a small bag of Perc 30s, the guy grooming teenage girls on Instagram, or the guy who stole a dirtbike out from under someone's back deck to plead down so that more resources can be devoted to the sketchy pain clinic that is actually a pill mill, the child porn manufacturing ring, or the chop shop that they have all had their eyes on for far longer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecrimeArrest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecrimeArrest">Precrime Arrest</a>: For the most part, the current justice systems around the world make a serious emphasis on "innocent until proven guilty" and "punishment after the crime". Attempting to capture someone before a crime <em>has</em> been committed (and there is no solid evidence of criminal conspiracy to support the suspicion) would be seen as wrongful arrest or even entrapment... and this is without taking into account the sci-fi angle of the Trope (which could be seen as violation of privacy, plus whichever discussion would ensue if there is a possibility, however small, for the criminal to say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a>"...)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective">Private Detective</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, kinda, but their jobs are usually far more mundane, especially when they need to avoid running afoul of the courts. The average private eye can expect to get a lot of process service and skip traces, divorce cases (mostly investigating suspected adultery, concealment of assets, or parental unfitness), insurance investigations (especially worker's comp and personal injury), and (if they specialize in it) due diligence for investors seeking risky investments, and while tailing someone or prowling around outside of their residences absolutely does happen (particularly in worker's comp cases; anyone who has dealt with these will tell you that the car with blacked-out windows camping out in front of someone's house is an inevitability), most of it involves creeping through public records and social media.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndRevenge">Rape and Revenge</a>: The type of premeditated manhunts that are standard to this trope would be considered straight-up murder, especially when it's someone other than the victim themselves doing it. (See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeOfSelfDefense">Crime of Self-Defense</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFinePrint">Read the Fine Print</a>: Contract law is as wildly varied and thorny as self-defense law, but as a rule of thumb you must at <em>least</em> to be able to read it (and although fiction depicts contracts as irrevocably binding, in reality courts sometimes decide that certain parts of a contract are unenforceable for one reason or another, with vagueness and/or being overly broad being the most common reasons.) Non-competes are another frequent target; they are to prevent former employees from running off with a bunch of clients or jumping ship to a competitor with a bunch of valuable information, and overly broad and/or restrictive non-competes that make it inordinately difficult or impossible for people to find work (especially if they do not have a particularly valuable or specialized skillset) are almost always smacked down by a judge. Non-competes exist to ensure that high-level or valuable workers do not use their positions to gain unfair advantages, not to cut their legs out from under them or chain them to a job. On the other hand, liability waivers usually <em>are</em> enforceable, but only within reason; the most reliable standard is that if they are extremely vague or broad, are hidden in fine print or written in a confusing or misleading manner, have a massive power imbalance (e.g., most employment-related ones), are against public policy, or are cited as a defense to extreme negligence or recklessness, they're probably unenforceable. However, a specific, reasonable, and easily identifiable liability waiver is something that will be upheld under most circumstances.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingYourRights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingYourRights">Reading Your Rights</a>: Varies <em>wildly</em> by jurisdiction.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueJuror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueJuror">Rogue Juror</a>: Specifically, the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth">Amateur Sleuth</a> in the jury starts own investigation" sub-division (which has appeared in various ways including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveAngryMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveAngryMen">12 Angry Men</a>"). Any attempt at doing this, be it sneaking out from wherever the jury has been sequestered or try to ask questions to a witness right in the middle of the courtroom) will equal getting kicked out of the jury and probably get arrested for perjury. One of the main goals of <em>voir dire</em> (the jury vetting process) is to make sure that people like this <em>don't</em> find their way onto juries; if even a hint of prejudice is detected, you're out of the running. If a runaway juror does make it on and is successful in unduly prejudicing a jury, that's a guaranteed appeal that will likely be successful.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a>: Varies wildly. Depending on the laws being cited, there is bound to be <em>some</em> stretching of definitions in a way that helps your case and/or hinders theirs, but there is a definite line of acceptability. It's up to a judge to decide when you've gone from "a bit of a stretch, but okay" to "blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewbaccaDefense">Chewbacca Defense</a>", and sanctions may be possible if you have a particularly flimsy or outright frivolous case that you attempted to prop up with some particularly ridiculous semantic leaps. Words count, but they don't mean shit if the case itself has no meat, and if you are successful in basing a substantial portion of your case around the interpretation of certain laws, it was either due to an incredibly specific set of circumstances or a badly-worded statute or decision.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensitivityTraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensitivityTraining">Sensitivity Training</a>: A regular workplace comedy trope in fiction, an actual legal necessity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.

Even in cases where their biases are clouding things, they'll at least do a token investigation and make a record of it. Which itself will build up if the parent/caretaker doesn't stop causing people to call all the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolomonDivorce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolomonDivorce">Solomon Divorce</a>: Not <em>totally</em> unusual in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> divorces (in the legal terminology, this is usually called a "split parenting situation"), however because it can be a traumatic experience for a child, the total disconnection from the other siblings that is seen in fiction is frowned upon if not forbidden by law (so such thing as visitation times or some psychological counsel are at least suggested).
<ul><li> A regular variation on this trope is that one parent gets the sole legal and physical/residential custody of the children<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6p2n5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6p2n5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6p2n5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The terminology is inconsistent across jurisdictions.</span> with no visitation/parenting time for the other spouse.

In real life, it does <em>not</em> happen without a ton of evidence to suggest that anything less would be likely to bring undue harm to the kids. Yes, family law is an ugly field and divorce is one of the ugliest aspects of it, but the courts are loath to completely cut off a parent and hate to give one parent exclusive access to the child unless it really is the best option. (This can get a bit confusing, however; a parent can have sole physical/residential custody, but then the other parent can have overnight visitation/parenting time for a substantial fraction of the child's time, e.g. alternate weekends. Some places would call this "joint" or "shared" physical/residential custody, but others would not, reserving that terminology for arrangements that call for a 50/50 split or something like that.) Indeed, in some jurisdictions (e.g. the United States), access to one's children is seen as a fundamental human right, on par with the the freedom of conscience and the right to a fair trial. If someone receives it, there is absolutely no doubt that the other parent either agreed to the arrangement, was unfit, or was otherwise a danger to the child. In general, only the most nonfunctional of addicts, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashOfTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashOfTheTitans">the absolute worst hoarders</a>, serial physical or sexual abusers, the nonfunctional mentally ill, and other people whose behavior or lifestyles are completely inimical to the well-being of their children and who should absolutely not be around them under any circumstances will be barred from seeing their children. Even then, the bar is often temporary; for instance, while it is common in cases where one parent of a child has successfully obtained a permanent or long-term domestic violence restraining order against the other parent for the abuser to be barred from seeing the child as part of the order, the usual thing is to allow that parent to prove him/herself capable of handling visitation (including overnights) by completing psychological assessment, counseling, or other psychiatric/psychological treatment (if necessary). If someone does not have custody of their children over a long period of time, they either rejected it or cannot or will not change whatever it is that got them barred from seeing their children to begin with</span>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopOrIWillShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopOrIWillShoot">Stop, or I Will Shoot!</a>: This varies from country to country and has changed over time.

Yes, you may have a case, yes, you'll probably prevail, and hell, you may even be in the right morally. If the circumstances of the case make it very likely that you'll kick up a shitstorm by litigating, however, a good attorney will advise you to seriously consider whether being right is worth the blow to your reputation. There are times where a favorable determination is <em>not</em> worth the consequences in the court of public opinion. Gag orders can sometimes curb this, but getting one that won't be thrown out the minute that their attorney contests it is quite difficult; to get a gag order to stick, the defendant generally has to have repeatedly and publicly spoken about their case in a way that is going to greatly inflame the passions of the public and impact both parties' right to a fair trial.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideDare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideDare">Suicide Dare</a>: Shitty, but generally not illegal. The rare few cases where someone <em>has</em> successfully been convicted of murder or manslaughter for encouraging suicide have involved either prolonged, relentless campaigns of adamant encouragement (the Michelle Carter case, and even <em>that</em> involved a great deal of deliberation that only resulted in a conviction because of the sheer egregiousness of her conduct) or deliberately leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for an individual that they know is actively suicidal (e.g., leaving a loaded firearm or a full bottle of pills that reliably cause fatal overdoses in plain sight), and, like the former, it really has to strike beyond the pale.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasObjectionable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasObjectionable">That Was Objectionable</a>: Arbitrarily objecting for no good reason just to stall or throw the other attorney off their game will quickly get you chewed out by a judge, and doing the same in a deposition will likely be reported to the judge when the other side gets sick of your shit and decides to pursue sanctions, and will get you sanctioned in general if it's a favorite tactic of yours and judges have had enough of you wasting the court's time with pointless and ridiculous objections.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoHigherCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoHigherCourt">There Is No Higher Court</a>: Well, yes, <em>eventually</em> you'll get to the highest court that has jurisdiction to hear the case. Depending on the jurisdiction that could be quite a few steps.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashOfTheTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashOfTheTitans">Trash of the Titans</a>: Hoarding and filth are a legitimate reason for Adult Protective Services (or similar agencies for non-US tropers) to step in, and if the building is dirty and poorly-maintained enough, most local government authorities can and will condemn it. Similarly, local authorities (namely town/city governments and HOAs) <em>will</em> step in if your property is badly overgrown, covered in broken appliances and inoperable vehicles, has garbage on it, or is otherwise unsightly or disgusting, as it degrades property values, attracts wild animals and provides breeding grounds for insects, and creates hazards for people stepping onto your land.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan">Vigilante Man</a>: Courts take an <em>extremely</em> dim view of vigilantism and people taking the law into their own hands. Most of the actions that are celebrated in fiction would lead to convictions for first-degree murder, kidnapping or false imprisonment, or any number of other extremely serious offenses. Perverted-Justice and other online "pedo hunter" groups deserve a special mention; in real life, courts tend to hate predator-hunting vigilantism because it almost always gets in the way and throws a gigantic monkey wrench into cases that should have been done deals. Ironically, one of the most common justifications for online predator hunts ("these people will just get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">Off on a Technicality</a>") is also a common self-fulfilling prophecy, as efforts of civilian pedo-hunter operations often <em>do</em> cause their cases to get thrown out or result in nonconvictions or successful appeals (usually either due to entrapment or because they rendered large amounts of evidence or testimony inadmissible).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAllLiveInAmerica">We All Live in America</a>: Once again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The United States has created a large amount of "law" shows since the inception of film and television. We <strong>seriously</strong> recommend that you consult your local laws, otherwise you (and your show) will be mocked for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">Critical Research Failure</a> at the very least.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponForIntimidation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponForIntimidation">Weapon for Intimidation</a>: Very, <em>very</em> illegal. Threatening someone with a gun, knife, or other implement that can reliably cause lethal physical injury is usually treated just as harshly as actually attacking them with it, and in jurisdictions that issue weapons permits at the discretion of issuing authorities, you will not be granted a permit if they suspect that you just want something to scare people with. The only time that it is ever <em>not</em> illegal in a civilian context is if it's part of an escalation of force in response to a credible threat, i.e. you told an attacker that you had a gun and that they needed to back off, they persisted, and you pulled out the gun, pointed it at them, and repeated what you said and warned them that you would shoot rather than immediately pulling it on them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitlessProtectionProgram" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitlessProtectionProgram">Witless Protection Program</a>: In theory, this is sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, but almost never to the same extent as in fiction. If you follow all the rules, the chances of you being successfully hunted down are infinitesimal; there are a <em>lot</em> of layers in the program and general failsafes, and while bad guys can certainly try to find you, the Marshals will find them well before they find you. On the other hand, "you can't fix stupid" absolutely applies, and protectees sometimes do carelessly blow their cover or wrongfully believe that they can have their cake and eat it too.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongfulAccusationInsurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongfulAccusationInsurance">Wrongful Accusation Insurance</a>: In Real Life, there are three things wrong with this scenario:
<ol><li> If someone has been successfully framed for a serious crime, they most likely aren't free to investigate it. They're in jail or on the run from the law.
</li><li> To the legal system, <em>why</em> you committed a crime is utterly irrelevant. Having a good reason doesn't get you any points unless, say, it gets murder knocked down to involuntary manslaughter.
</li><li> If you've already been <em>convicted</em>, even later-proven innocence is not a defense. You don't have a right to a pardon, a new trial (unless there was a procedural error) or any reduction of your sentence.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8p0uk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8p0uk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8p0uk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Depending on jurisdiction...post-conviction relief on the basis of actual innocence varies from state to state in the US. In particular, the emergence of DNA testing has lead to many new state laws allowing for challenging one's conviction based on evidence not available at the time. The Supreme Court has ruled that that's not a right, though.</span>

Of course, Rhodey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">calls out the Senator when he makes this demand</a>. More generally, Tony's ownership of a weapons suite with mounted anti-tank missiles is blatantly illegal and would get him arrested in short order. As would his vigilante activities in the first movie, including flying out to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and shooting people. His refusal to share his technology with the government would also never stand.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em>: The situation that sets up the plot of the film, Damage Control voiding Adrian Toomes' legal city contract without compensating him (followed by one of them mocking him for thinking that they would), is <em><strong>highly</strong></em> illegal. In any situation like this, the government has a legal obligation to compensate businesses for what is essentially seizure of eminent domain, and given the stakes involved, a salvage company operating on a city contract in New York City (the most contested real-estate market in the world), Toomes had more than enough to sue for a big fat check from the government.

Nearly everything about the signing scene is wrong:
<ul><li> There is no lawyer present for the signing, nor a review of the contract. Jerrica simply takes a cursory look at the contact and signs without reading any of the fine print.
</li><li> Multiple reviews of the film pointed out that there are virtually no major record label contracts that <em>only</em> require you to initial the first page. Nearly every contract signing, regardless of industry, requires that the signer(s) read and initial each page so that they understand what is being said.
</li><li> Jerrica waives away any royalties or income until an unspecified point in time after her tour is completed. No mention is made by her of how she's supposed to support herself, how Erica's offer is better than any other label's or how this is legally sound.
</li><li> Finally, Jerrica signs the document as "Jem", her stage alias. Not only is this absurd, but it isn't legally enforceable. If she chose to, Jerrica could break the contract and simply claim that the signature wasn't hers if she was taken to court.

<ul><li> Massive liberties are taken to make Kincaid's testimony the only thing that can get Belorussian ex-dictator Dukhovich convicted at the Hague. A victim whose family was killed in front of him and was put in a work camp for three years has his <em>entire</em> testimony dismissed out of hand, with the implications that all of the other witnesses so far have had the same. Such testimony would not simply be declared "hearsay" (which, by the way, is when a witness is asked <em>what they were told happened by somebody else</em>, not <em>what happened to them personally</em>) and struck even if the defense claimed they were merely political opponents doing smear jobs. Somehow Kincaid was the only person to have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> pictures</span> as proof of Dukhovich's crimes despite this being set in the modern day and that is the only kind of evidence that seems to work.
</li><li> Also, it is entirely possible to have witnesses testify from remote locations. Kincaid could easily have testified on a video chat from his cell <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and given the website information from there</span>.

In addition, the judge also places a restraining order on Quinn by banning him for a period of five years from partaking in any competitive martial arts. In reality, a judge would not have the authority to ban someone for participating in a sport; that authority comes from said sport's sanctioning or governing body. Strange enough, Quinn never tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">appeal the judge's ban on competing</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHitman">The Hitman</a></em>: It would not be legal for a police officer to work undercover as a <em>contract killer</em>, no matter how much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> he may be.

</li><li> The horror movie <em>Curse Of Bigfoot</em> has a weird example where a teacher is talking about horror movies, but never actually names any of them, instead just alluding to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExorcist">films about demonic possession</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">The movie with the great white shark</a>", presumably because everyone involved in the production was under the misconception that actually saying film titles violates some copyright law.

In truth, this gets complicated. Licensed firearms businesses (where, obviously, the overwhelming majority of gun sales take place) or "FFLs" are obligated under federal law to perform background checks on ALL their customers. No matter the location—there is no such thing as an internet or gun show "loophole" for any lawful purchase. <em>Private</em> purchases, where one person might decide to sell a gun to one of their friends living in the same state, do not. If it's across state lines, an FFL will have to act as a middle-man. "Universal background checks" effectively places an additional tax on private individuals who probably cannot afford such a burden, in addition to possibly trespassing privacy rights. In other words, Bill's statement is <em>technically</em> correct in an extremely forgiving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> interpretation, but wildly misleading all the same.

In reality, there's nothing illegal about following someone around and noting that he ate lunch in a public restaurant with other people, as this is all publicly observable information. It would only be illegal if Fox harassed Wildman in some way, and Fox tries <em>not</em> to be noticed by Wildman or anyone with him. The first illegal act Fox <em>actually</em> commits is searching a law firm's records (under the ruse of co-owning the cleaning company) and making copies of them for Gekko.

This part is perfectly legitimate under the quite unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">American Political System</a> (it's happened three times in real life), but after that his main rival, Governor Sam Evans, sues in Ohio, hoping to get the waiver of their sore-loser law that got Dalton on the ballot overturned under a lobbying law, thereby invalidating Dalton's win in Ohio and giving Evans the win. This idea ignores a fundamental fact about the electoral college: all the state popular vote does is <em>suggest</em> to the state's electors how the residents <em>want</em> them to vote, and all electoral college ballots are final once submitted. At most Evans might delegitimize Dalton's win and cause him political problems down the road, but he can't actually overturn the election once the electoral college and House have already voted.

The age of consent in Virginia is 18, but in Maryland and Washington, D.C. it's 16 (ditto the UCMJ, although the suspect is a civilian so that isn't relevant), and Maryland and D.C. also have Romeo-and-Juliet laws.

There are a couple of problems with this:
<ul><li> In real life, the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention cited actually <em>doesn't</em> outlaw bioweapons; those are covered by a different set of treaties (the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibits their use but not their creation, while the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention outlaws them altogether). However, Burnham also cites a fictional 22nd-century version of the Conventions under which these are apparently covered.

In real life, the Good Samaritan Law protects people from being charged when they do try to help someone is danger. The trial is also filled with various examples, such as the judge allowing witnesses that have no relevance simply because the prosecution already paid for their travel expenses. Also, the maximum punishment for such a violation would be a $300 fine, not a one-year prison sentence, especially since there was a cop standing close by and not doing anything to help and even testifying to that effect.

Bored, he gets up to leave. The prisoner, whose English is spotty at best, tells him that he'll get hung for sure. Sherlock corrects him on his grammar by saying he'll be <em>hanged</em>. Apparently, neither character is aware that Belarus uses the firing squad to execute capital offenders. It's odd for a citizen of that country and also odd for a world-class detective.

<ul><li> First of all, SFPD doesn't have detectives, it has inspectors, so back when Monk was still a cop, he should have been called Inspector Monk.
</li><li> Stottlemeyer and Disher are shown to be personally investigating cases. Except they're a police captain and lieutenant, respectively, and such people typically engage in more managerial duties, leaving investigations to regular detectives/inspectors.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk Gets Jury Duty": As a police consultant, Monk would likely be ineligible to participate in a jury trial. Also, there's no requirement that the police hand off a criminal to the feds in a court building rather than a prison.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk in Outer Space": When Monk proves that Brandon Lorber was already dead when he was shot, Stottlemeyer says that it's officially not their case since there's no crime. Actually, if the shooter wasn't certain that the man was dead at the time of the shooting, then this qualifies as attempted murder. And if he was certain that the man was dead, then he's guilty of desecrating the dead, which is a Class 6 felony.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the Captain's Wife": Captain Stottlemeyer is personally investigating the case of his wife being hit by a tow truck. Except cops are not allowed to take part in investigations involving immediate relatives, as it presents a conflict of interests.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the Rapper": After the explosion of a limo that killed a rapper, the driver is taken to a hospital. The killer sneaks in and kills him before he can testify. Except in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> there'd be police protection for the only witness to a crime.
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the Game Show": It's unlikely that Roddy Lankman and Val Birch's plan would have worked, given that game shows have people who watch the recordings specifically to catch attempts at cheating, and Birch wasn't exactly hiding it well, especially when he answered the question even before he saw the picture it referred to. In addition, cheating on a televised game show is a federal crime.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow2">Saints Row 2</a></em>: The game begins with Johnny Gat being tried for "... one count of attempted murder and 387 counts of murder." Johnny claims that with the statute of limitations being what it is the latter count "should be closer to two-fifty", only for the exasperated judge to roll her eyes and explain that there is no statute of limitations for murder.
</li><li> The entirety of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> series plays very loose with the legal system of Japan. It is true that the game admits that the legal system was overhauled in its fictional universe to better finish trials in expedited formats of three days (basically meaning all investigation and discovery is done within 72, as is the case and the conviction), but the legal system is so skewed out of the realm of reality that it barely resembles the Japanese legal system at all and violates major sections of the Constitution of Japan in regards to legal rights (Right to not self-incriminate, right to a fair trial, protection against unlawful detention, etc). This is also jarring if you're an American playing the localized version as the text in-game claims it is the American legal system, and so much of the game's legal behaviors are solid violations of American Constitutional Rights and Amendments that any lawyer watching the story unfold the way it does would practically have a heart attack at the clear miscarriages of justice in every text box. Luckily the game doesn't use any real individuals and exists in its own fictional version of Earth in Japan which makes the disconnect easier to swallow, but still has moments where one questions how the justice system gets anything done in this fictional world with a solid "Guilty until Proven 100% innocent" mentality that could very easily be abused (and sometimes is).
<ul><li> MAJOR SPOILER <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">How, for example, could Miles Edgeworth be seriously find guilty of a murder committed when he was a child that he was present for but, beyond his confession, there is no evidence of the true culprit? There is no proof of what happened and mitigating circumstances, including a loss of oxygen in the room and a brawl breaking out between a bailiff and Edgeworth's father (not to mention Edgeworth being so young and panicked so his memory could not be legally trusted), are seemingly irrelevant to the court. Time should factor in as well given the murder is almost a <em>decade-and-a-half old</em> which means Edgeworth accidentally discharged the firearm and is being held guilty for it at the age of twenty four when the murder happened when he was just <em>nine years old</em>. Yes, there is no statue of limitations for murder, but somehow Edgeworth's young age doesn't factor into the decision at <em>all</em>. All that matters is he threw a gun in an effort to break up a fight (yes, threw it, not fired it, it went off by <em>accident</em> even by his own confession), it discharged, and Gregory Edgeworth died, and nothing else seems to be remotely relevant in the eyes of the law.</span> This is just one example in one case. In this one case alone there are numerous violations of both legal systems, and every case before and after this in following games almost all have some major violation that is blatantly insane for any legal system.
</li><li> <em>Spirit of Justice</em> gives us a threefold example in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryBrat">Armie Buff</a>'s RC helicopter, Sergeant "Sarge" Buff. First off, why they would allow an RC helicopter with <em>functional</em> weapons into the courtroom, even if it's a toy, is beyond understanding. Any sane judge would have it swapped out with a simple two-way radio. Second, said weapons are used <em>repeatedly</em> against Apollo over the course of the drone's testimony. The third example is recursively twofold in that at one point, Athena's Mood Matrix session is interrupted when Sarge steals Widget, and when the judge tries to bring order to the court, Sarge steals his gavel as well before he can use it, and threatens to turn the case into a military tribunal with Sarge as the judge (not the person, the toy chopper). Immediately thereafter, an attempt at getting the stolen items back results in a firefight breaking out between Athena and <em>two</em> bailiffs VS Sarge. Altogether, even if Sarge <em>was</em> allowed in lieu of something more practical, the various antics it causes would normally result in Armie being charged with theft (Widget and the judge's gavel<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note118ewh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note118ewh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note118ewh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Theft of Government Property in the case of the latter, which is much worse than simple Petty Theft.</span>), assault (attacking Apollo, Athena, and the bailiffs), and contempt (everything else), and had their testimony thrown out on grounds of insanity as a result. And even if Armie was allowed to continue, Sarge would have been confiscated and replaced with something less likely to attack those around it.

On top of that, he is allowed to retain his Darkwing costume and identity while behind bars, instead of having to be Drake Mallard in a prison uniform.

However, in reality, the show would've been cancelled anyway due to the near-death of 9 kids (not that anything else they have to do on the show is much better). The only difference being that if they did happen to drown, Chris would have been arrested rather than simply fired.
</li><li> In "Scarlett Fever", Chris doesn't seem worried that all the contestants could die if the island exploded, even though this would likely lead to the show being cancelled and him being arrested again.
</li><li> To be fairly honest, pretty much half of the stuff that he does would be more than enough to get him fired at the very least. Given how some of the injuries—such as Heather's jellyfish stings—could easily have fatal or life altering side effects—like Trent eating poisonous blowfish—have nearly killed the contestants, Chris, in real life, would have been fired, arrested, and likely jailed barely a third of the way through the first season.

Apparently, Seafoam McDuck was supposed to deliver a shipment of marbles to Diddle O'Way, but it was lost at sea. The contract held Seafoam liable, and Diddle was supposed to get Seafoam's property in compensation, except Seafoam also lost his property at sea except for a gold watch. Seafoam ran away with the watch. Generations later, Scrooge sold the watch to buy a plane to get to Klondike, where he acquired his fortune. Except simply showing up at someone's house with a piece of paper has no force of law. Fritter would have to sue Scrooge and prove that this flimsy chain of events entitles him to everything Scrooge owns. And the courts are unlikely to side with Fritter. At most, they may demand that Scrooge pay him the amount the watch was worth at the time (adjusted for inflation), which would be a tiny amount of Scrooge's fortune. In the episode, the matter is resolved by finding the original shipment at sea and returning it to Fritter, thus fulfiling the contract.
