</p><p>The trope takes its name from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory">a myth spread by Prince Felix Yusupov</a> about the assassination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk">Grigori Rasputin</a> in 1916 (which many scholars had analyzed and found semi-plausible explanations for how Rasputin could have survived the abuse he was allegedly put through). Ironically, Rasputin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> death wasn't very Rasputinian; the 1916 autopsy report (as discovered after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> and reviewed by American and Russian doctors in 2002) shows that Rasputin was shot twice in the back, with a final bullet to the head, which killed him instantly.
</p><p>However, his killers wanted to portray him as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">a near-indestructible son of Satan</a>, so they made up an elaborate story about how he survived poison, beating, and bullet wounds only to drown in the Neva. Later embellishments by Yusupov (he thought up a new one every time he was short on money) even had Rasputin dying of hypothermia, having attempted to claw through the ice that covered him, and to top it off, another version said that when they cremated him, his body was trying to get up again as it burned.

The second time, what's left of his AS falls into the ocean (Where he is attacked by sharks), but in spite of that and a case of terminal cancer he turns back up <em>again</em> in <em>The Second Raid</em>, now only alive enough to have one final conversation with Sousuke. He finally dies for real after Sousuke unloads a gun into him and the entire building he's in blows up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, this happens with the homunculi. Their Philosopher's Stone powers enable them to survive being killed repeatedly, but they have a finite number of "lives" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">based on the number of souls trapped in their Stone</span>, so a sufficient number of brutal fatalities can take them down for good.
</li><li> In the case of Lust it takes half a dozen bullets, a bomb blast, entirely destroying her body by ripping out her Stone, two dozen more bullets, and being set on fire over and over to finally kill her. Which, of course, set up Roy Mustang's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> line, "I'll just keep killing you until you die."
</li><li> Bradley/Wrath got one, what with him still going strong after being on a train that exploded, getting run through, having an eye clawed out, getting shot, nearly drowning, nearly being set on fire and having his hands blasted off. He has now finally died of blood loss but had enough time to give a dying speech first. It should be noted that Wrath/Bradley is the only Homunculus without any healing powers, he's just that badass. In fact, the man who blew his arms off admitted that if it wasn't for A: relatively old age slowing him down, B: all the other wounds, and C: the sun flashing in his one good eye at the right moment to temporarily blind him, Wrath <em>probably would have won</em>, and after receiving his final wound, managed to inflict a few more injuries on his killer with a blade held <em>in his teeth</em> before blood loss caught up with him.
</li><li> And Envy got his Philosopher's Stone destroyed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize">reducing him to</a> a little fetus... fish... <em>thing</em>, ate a bunch of Cyclops soldiers to grow back to his full size, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">got</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Colonel Mustang</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">angry</a>, which resulted in him getting his tongue burned out, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">the water in his eyes boiled</a> several times, and being lit on fire over and over and over. And Riza shot him about a dozen times, too. After Roy burninated him back to Fetus!Envy, he gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingTheMonsterToDeath">lectured</a> by Ed and finally rips what's left of his Stone out, committing suicide. Sheesh.
</li><li> Sloth got filled full of bullets, shot a couple of times by a tank, frozen solid, and defrosted none the worse for wear; the next encounter with him saw him being filled with <em>even more</em> bullets, stabbed and pummeled by Alex and Olivier Armstrong, tossed around like a ragdoll by Izumi and Sieg, and eventually dying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoOutWithASmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoOutWithASmile">with a smile on his face</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">charging into a bunch of giant spikes</a> Armstrong had made grow out of the floor.

</li><li> The 2003 anime's version of Pride is paralyzed and then incinerated repeatedly by Mustang until his body runs out of red stones (although, this was enabled by Mustang getting a hold of Pride's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a>, something the homunculi didn't have in the manga/Brotherhood). Notably, this happened in the anime's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a> long before Mustang fought Lust (and killed her in the same manner) in the manga.

Number of things he survives over the course of one night (most in rapid succession) before Firo finally "consumes" him: being shot dozens of times by gangsters; getting run over by his own car; being literally stabbed in the back by his disgruntled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>; getting set on <em>fire</em>; and having his arm sliced in two - the long way - by Firo. Okay, so he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">immortal</a>, but props anyway for taking everything up until the fire in stride.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>, there are two deaths in Season 1 that might qualify. The first is Lockon's death, the second it Alejandro's.
<ul><li> Lockon first goes out in the GN-ARMS Type-D. When that is destroyed, he ejects the Gundam Dynames just before the explosion, losing the GN-Full Shield in the process. Then the Dynames gets severely damaged by Ali Al-Zaachez's Gundam Throne Zwei and its GN Fangs, leaving the Dynames without both arms, legs, and head, and the pilot visibly injured (and his helmet cracked). He then takes the targeting system from Dynames, connects it to the remains of the GN-ARMS and fires, but at the same moment, Throne Zwei fires back, causing the cannon Lockon was standing on to explode, killing Lockon. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, Lockon would have died even without being caught in the explosion.
</li><li> Alejandro's death is a more downtoned example. Up until that point, GN-drive powered MS could be destroyed in a few direct hits from other GN-drive powered MS. Alejandro's Alvaroon is stabbed with 6 separate swords before the final blow. From a SEVENTH sword.

And nothing of that would have happened had Whitebeard not been stabbed by one of his children the moment he decided he'd get in the fight.
<ul><li> He didn't go down without a fight, either. He was truly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">Defiant to the End</a>, telling the entire world with his last breath that One Piece <em>does</em> exist (thumbing his nose at the World Government in the process by kickstarting a new age of piracy and cementing his place alongside such legends as <strong>Gold Roger, the former Pirate King</strong>). And on top of that, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssLongcoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadAssLongcoat">Bad Ass Longcoat</a> falls off immediately after, revealing that despite having hundreds of scars and wounds from knives, swords, and bullets, his back didn't have so much as one<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zxlq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0zxlq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zxlq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Minus a few that were the result of getting <em>IMPALED FROM THE FRONT</em>.</span>; having never been wounded there in his <em>entire life</em>, because he <em>never retreated from an enemy</em> and was <em>never caught off guard.</em> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">Not.

</li><li> Not to mention, it's heavily implied that the only reason that was enough to kill him is that he was already terminally ill; he was usually seen hooked up to medical equipment and iv-drips while being attended to by several nurses. In his younger, healthier days, all of those insane wounds combined <em>still</em> wouldn't have taken him down.
<ul><li> Sengoku, the man in charge of the Marine forces, outright says that Whitebeard is well past his prime and is just a shadow of his former self. While this does mean that Whitebeard was a monster Sengoku also says that he's just the man who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">came second to Gold Roger in the effort to be the pirate king</a>.

<ul><li> Zabuza Momochi is bitten by a half-dozen dogs, his arms rendered useless, and stabbed with an armory's worth of weapons during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructiveCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDestructiveCharge">run on Gato</a> before giving a tender goodbye to his loyal companion Haku. Having accomplished his goals he died apparently because he didn't have anything else to be badass at doing.
</li><li> Orochimaru has his arms devoured by the Shinigami, his transfer form torn to shreds by Sasuke, and finally gets stabbed by a sword that forces him into a permanent illusion when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">reappears later</a>. This doesn't even kill all of him, as he is still alive and trying to take over Kabuto. Now he's back to more-or-less human form again, as Sasuke revived him. The guy just won't stay dead.
</li><li> Kakuzu was stabbed through the heart twice and blown up with a jutsu that essentially killed him on a cellular level. And then Kakashi had to kill him <em>again</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeSureHesDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeSureHesDead">just to make sure.</a>
</li><li> Jiraiya gets an arm taken off by a surprise attack, is stabbed in the shoulder of his remaining arm, then gets his throat crushed and get stabbed by a half-dozen metallic bars, and dies... before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">willing himself back to life</a></em> so he can send a message before finally drowning in a lake.

Then she gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedInsideAPersonShapedCan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedInsideAPersonShapedCan">sealed in her son</a>, where she lies dormant for several years.
</li><li> But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Obito Uchiha</a> сlearly takes the cake in this series. First, back before the story-line even began, he had half his body crushed by a boulder. He got better, albeit with some help. Decades later, in a period of a few days, he lost an arm, lost an arm (the same one that he had since replaced) <em>again</em> while being blown up by <em>600 billion explosive tags</em>, and technically dying, surviving only with the help a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">forbidden technique</a>. Later got stabbed through the heart <em>on purpose</em>, was mind-raped by an ancient quasi-deity, half-disintegrated himself, was cut nearly in half, had the nine Tailed Beasts torn out of him, was body jacked, was forced to perform a suicide-resurrection technique, had the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path that he was using as life-support also ripped out of him (by this point, he really <em>would</em> have keeled over had Naruto not used his newly-acquired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">Healing Hands</a> to put him back into some level of shape), stressed himself to the point of chakra exhaustion multiple times, got killed by a bone-spear that literally rotted him to ash, flipped off the afterlife with his eyes to return and empower his old friend Kakashi, before finally deciding he'd done enough and <em>letting himself pass on</em>.

And that was just his back story. In the final battle against him, he defeats Aoshi, Sanosuke, and Saito, and almost kills Kenshin, though Kenshin recovers and continues to fight. In the end, Kenshin doesn't even defeat him. Technically, Shishio defeats himself by fighting for too long, overheating due to his sweat glands being destroyed when he was burned, and then finally bursting into flames.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em> Guyot used up all of his energy, had his arm and the right side of his torso nearly severed, had his zoacrystal <em>pulled out of his brain</em>, got a quantum black hole blast through his <em>heart</em>, and <em>fell over half a mile <strong>into an erupting volcano</strong></em>. And then it turns out he's still alive.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Implacable Man</a> Roberto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> is shot in the shoulder and left for dead in a burning library. He drags himself out only after everyone else leaves, with his good arm paralyzed. When he next appears he's gotten into much better shape, and eventually gets into a fight with fellow Implacable Man Inspector Runge, where he's shot in the gut but still manages to get the better of the Inspector. Runge turns the tables by jamming his thumb into Roberto's bullet wound, causing him to pass out, but only briefly as he manages to stagger to where the final confrontation between Tenma and Johan is taking place before dying.
<ul><li> You'd think that after that ordeal, anyone would want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetThemDieHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetThemDieHappy">let the poor man die happy</a>, not least the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a> that he served tirelessly as a committed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>...but, alas, no.

He also does all of this without eating, drinking, or getting any sleep for literally days. It finally takes the electric chair itself to kill him, and even then they have to shock him twice.

</li><li> The movie version of Steward Denethor of Gondor has this happen to him when he finally goes off the deep end and becomes suicidal. After being led to believe that Faramir is dead, he first covers himself in oil, intending to set himself on fire. Then, shortly after seeing that Faramir is alive (this was <em>bad</em> timing), he catches aflame, sprints a few hundred yards screaming, waving his arms the entire time, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyVillainDeath">jumps off a cliff</a>.

Here's what happens to him: first, he gets ambushed by three gangsters, beaten viciously, and thrown into the trunk of their car. Next, Boris is still in there while the vehicle is in a car accident. Then Boris crawls out and gets hit by a van at high speed. <em>And after that</em> Boris surprises everyone by showing up to a major shootout with an AK-74M, only to have Bullet-Tooth Tony finally shoot him with the entire magazine (plus one bullet from an earlier mag) from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">.50AE Desert Eagle</a> (it's amazing he never had a stoppage—Desert Eagles have a well-deserved reputation for being jam-o-matics). At that point, Boris has finally had enough. (Also, note these events <em>are not</em> spread out, they happen one after another in a very short amount of time).
</li><li> Tony himself is a subversion. His tough-guy credentials come from the fact that he survived getting shot six times in one sitting and was still strong enough to kill his attacker with a sword. However, a single stray bullet is enough to put him down. It's so random that the character who shot him doesn't even realize it at first. Partially justified in that Ari was blasting away with Tony's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Hand Cannon</a> (and the film doesn't show where was Tony hit — it may have been a headshot, for all we know).

Later, Ricardo Montalban plummets to his doom after being shot with a sedative dart, then is run over by a steamroller and trampled by a marching band. Earlier, the mind-controlled doctor gets one. While attempting to flee, he swerves his car into a truck transporting gas, escapes the explosion with half his car only to roll into a truck carrying huge missiles, escapes that explosion as well, ending up on the last missile that rolls into a nearby fireworks factory. Cue third explosion.

Also, Robin Swallows who is asked 'why won't you die?' by Austin himself after she is: stabbed, shot with a machine gun, shot with a bazooka, and then falls off a building (though if she really dies is uncertain). A deleted scene shows that Austin keeps her in his car trunk as a handy human shield.

He then goes through a pedestrian flyover and falls into some power cables before finally coming to a rest on a conveyor belt. He only finally dies after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByLookingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByLookingUp">meeting the rock crusher</a> at the end of it, which turns his head into a pulp.

He's one of an apparently elite group who have a mask on a pole that rises from the back armor. He survives everything (including having the car he's in rammed by the train and explode, leaving him blackened and screaming on the cowcatcher)... until his mask is finally knocked off him when he uses his dying strength to give Max the finger.

Madmartigan smashes his skull-mask, and Kael chases Madmartigan up a flight of stairs. Madmartigan stabs him in the chest; Kael responds by punching Madmartigan in the face and trying to strangle him. Madmartigan slashes Kael's belly, then twists the blade still in his chest. Kael does not appear to notice. Madmartigan impales him on his own sword. Kael is still on his feet when Madmartigan finally shoves him off the walkway. Even then he is still moving so Madmartigan throws a dagger into him just for good measure.

And then, he burns alive after recharging himself on a high voltage power line, gets his normal heart back inside him, which stops, and then starts again, ending the credits with him opening his eyes... <em>again!</em>

Continues to grunt and flail for a minute, realises that the Slayer and his master are watching him, with disapproving looks. At the end of the film, now that his master is apparently dead and the Slayer is long gone, he opens his eyes again and starts doing his fake "death" scene again. "Death" groans continue throughout the credits.
</li><li> Memnon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing">The Scorpion King</a></em> also dies like this. He is pierced by an arrow, thrown from the top of a building and set on fire during the fall.

After dropping an already lethal distance from an elevator shaft, he falls into large impaling spikes.

</li><li> What happens to the teacher in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination1">Final Destination</a></em> is a textbook example. An exploding computer monitor drives shards of glass into her throat, a trail of fire starts heading towards her down the trail of dripped vodka from her mug, and her attempt to pull down a towel drops a butcher-block full on knives into her chest. When the protagonist comes in to try to save her, to add insult to injury, a bookcase falls and drives the knife deeper into her chest. And then her house explodes. The actress who played the teacher was the wife of one of the writers, so he wrote this scene just for her.
</li><li> Hades, the mutant leader from the 2007 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsHaveEyes2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHillsHaveEyes2">The Hills Have Eyes 2</a></em> is shot, impaled, brutally beaten, <em>has chunks of his brain ripped out</em> and only dies after getting a bayonet through the mouth (after another beatdown).

Trying to get the things off Heather accidentally smashes her face through a mirror, leaving a big shard of glass embedded in her forehead. Somehow still alive Heather actually starts ripping her own face off, finally dying about halfway through removing it. Also, as all this is going on the spiders just keep coming, eventually covering most of the room.

<ul><li> In its debut film, the title character demonstrates its notorious "immortality", first by having its chest blown out with a rocket launcher, only for its skeletal system to rip out of its ruined body and continue to move on its own. It continues to scuttle after the protagonists, even through several point-blank grenade blasts, only so much as losing an arm when one is strapped directly to its ribcage. It continues to press on until it takes a point-blank shot from a BFG, obliterating the skeleton... and leaving the head to fly around and grow an entirely new body minutes later. Finally, its primary head is shot to bits, and it dies... at least until the sequel.
</li><li> In the sequel, Zeiram gets a sword through the forehead and its arm cut off and heals up just fine. It then has a grenade stuffed under one of its breastplates, semi-crippling it. The heroine then shoots at it repeatedly until its limbs are severed and its mechanical head is obliterated. Its central head pops out and gets shot off as well... just in time for the remaining portion to try and reform itself.

First, she takes dozens of bullets from a barrage of assault rifles, shotguns, and machine guns, and tanks a shot from a rocket launcher before fleeing. In the final battle, she successively gets mauled by a pack of <em>Velociraptor</em> while being shot at by a semi-automatic rifle designed for large game, gets her throat ripped at by a <em>Tyrannosaurus</em>, and then facing off against a <em>Tyrannosaurus</em> and <em>Velociraptor</em> tag-team fight, during which she has her face smashed into buildings and several pieces of metal rebar speared into her.

Before either of these things can kill him, Snape does <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> upon Dumbledore's own request</span> an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Avada Kedavra</a> curse which lifts Dumbledore's body off the North Tower and sends him crashing to the ground <em>far</em> below.

</li><li> One standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">version of vampire lore</a> (dating back at least to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em>) says that to kill a vampire, you need to stake him through the heart <em>and</em> chop his head off (not to mention filling his mouth with garlic/holy wafers). And sometimes burn the body to ashes and toss said ashes into a fast-flowing river. And in at least one version of the lore, even when all the steps are taken it wasn't really dead. A drop of blood on the ashes would reform it — stopped only by the fact that the ashes are scattered too widely.

This is because on the Disc <em>every single vampire cliché is true</em>, but any single cliché does not necessarily apply to <em>any one vampire</em>, so anyone trying to kill them has to try several different ways to make sure they actually die. Vampires eventually start carrying easily broken vials of blood so they'll smash and bring them back if they're dusted, which for the ones sensitive to light as well is fairly often (especially if they work as photographers). <br/><br/>He has serious fun with this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CarpeJugulum">Carpe Jugulum</a></em>, where various subtypes of vampire have increasingly silly requirements for true death, starting at the weirdest end of the real-life myths and going from there, including mention of a vampire who wouldn't die until <em>carrots got hammered in its ears</em>!

The bad guy's ultimate goal was to clone the prototype and create an army capable of overthrowing the world's governments and — in ruling the world — creating a reign of terror unmatched even by such real-life villains as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.

The drugged-up ex-boxer passes out on his favorite prostitute's bed and is injected with snake venom by her and an accomplice. His boss's wife is fed shrimp by his boss, in order to trigger Happy's allergy when they hook up, causing his throat to swell. He's then shot through the throat with a crossbow by one of the people who injected him with snake venom, allowing him to breathe again. He figures out what the prostitute did and goes back to her room angry, and she hits him with a crowbar. Then he staggers off to rest on a chair by the brothel's swimming pool and leans over to pick up a cigarette. The chair collapses under his weight and drops him into the pool, wherein he finally drowns. The entire episode basically consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">Your Princess Is in Another Castle!</a> as each suspect is cleared of actually landing the killing blow and ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">Doc Robbins sighing as he lists the various "mitigating factors" in his report</a>.

</li><li> Boney M's Disco song, <em>Rasputin</em>, mentions his end. Believe it or not, this is one of the more accurate portrayals of his death; it ends with Rasputin being shot to death and leaves out the drowning myth.

It's not clear whether she was thrown in the river just to hide the body, or if he was hoping she'd drown as well.
</li><li> The Celtic folksong "The Sick Note," based on a monologue by Gerard Hoffnung, is about a bricklayer who falls off a fourteen-story building, surviving numerous amusing injuries on the way down.
</li><li> The traditional song "John Barleycorn" looks like it's about this at first - poor John Barleycorn is buried alive, left out in a field until midsummer's day, has his legs cut off at the knee, is stabbed in the heart by pitchforks, tied to a cart and rolled round a field, flayed by being hit with sticks, and finally ground between two millstones. However, the last verse reveals it's about the harvesting process, and John, who's now become whiskey, "proved the strongest man at last".
</li><li> There's an American folk song called "Grey Goose" (most famously covered by Huddie William "Lead Belly" Ledbetter) about a goose that <em>just won't die</em>:

Even as skin peeled from bone, he managed to build himself a funeral pyre by <em>tearing down trees</em> and ordered his companions to set him ablaze. Apparently being burned alive hurt less than the poison. <br/><br/>Just as a general idea of how horrifically painful and potent the blood of the Hydra is: when one of Hercules' poisoned arrows <em>nicked</em> the immortal centaur Chiron, it left him writhing in agony (because the poison couldn't actually <em>kill</em> him) and begging Hercules to end his life. Because he was one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">the few good Centaurs</a>, Chiron was then lifted to the stars by Zeus as a constellation (either Sagittarius or Centaurus, depending on whether you're listening to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ovid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ovid">Ovid</a> or not).

Next, Untamo orders the construction of a pyre and attempts to burn Kullervo - the pyre burns for several days without Kullervo getting hurt at all. Untamo attempts to hang Kullervo, but Kullervo survives this as well.
</li><li> English folklore states that a wizard must be killed three times before they die for good. Prescribed methods are generally stabbing, impaling, and then drowning.

And just in case that the corpse might <em>still</em> not be done, some possible vampires were buried with their face down, so they would at least go out of their coffin the wrong way.

</li><li> In the "Operation: Rimfire" <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mekton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mekton">Mekton</a></em> adventure, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Lord Dremmond's</a> death scene description is, and I quote: <em>"Tough as nails, he gets one dying speech"</em> (followed by a <strong>twenty-seven</strong> lines such speech) <em>"before any PC can finish him off"</em>. That would be not a Rasputinian Death but a vanilla <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">Final Speech</a>, were not his death in the middle of a frantic close-quarters battle with the whole Rimfire flight crew gang-banging him with all sort of weapons, including lightsabers, in an alien spaceship full of monsters about to be psychically awakened by him — which really gives the PCs no reason at all to cease fire until well after he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeaderThanDead">Deader Than Dead</a>. Which every group of players, routinely, does. After that, he detonates a hard-radiation nuke. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">survives</a>. It should be noted that Dremmond's death scene <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">often becomes</a> quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">the opposite of what was intended</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, and more generally in games that use a hit point mechanic, high-level characters often survive a series of horrific traumas any one of which should be fatal — anything from being dropped off a 200-foot cliff, to being squashed by a falling block of stone, to being eaten by an enormous monster.
<ul><li> Just as one example, going by the rules as written: It's possible for a character to fall <em>from orbit</em>, with no special protective equipment (or any equipment at all, actually), land on the ground, and pick himself up and walk away, bruised and probably not feeling so great, but still completely able-bodied. Assuming minimum damage is rolled, this is technically possible at level 1. Though there -is- an inversion of sorts, especially early on, noted as the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">Massive Damage</a>" rule. If you hit a single enemy with one attack for fifty or more hit points of damage, the victim must make a roll to save versus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">Instant Death.</a>
</li><li> The tarrasque can be slain only by inflicting enough damage to kill it (despite its extreme regeneration and epic DR), then using a <em>Wish</em> or <em>Miracle</em> spell (essentially, invoking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>) to make it stay dead. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">nuking its corpse</a> doesn't work, because it will revive inside a week without the Wish. And in 3rd ed. it takes getting it down to -30 hit points to kill it in the first place (rather then the -10 it takes to kill most other things).
</li><li> Subjects of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">holy word</a></em> and its sister spells <em>dictum</em>, <em>blasphemy</em>, and <em>word of chaos</em> suffer an escalating series of effects based on the difference between the caster level and the subject's hit dice. If the difference is ten or more, the victim is deafened, blinded, paralyzed, and killed instantly. One would have thought the last one would have been enough.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mm/20021018a">vampire lord<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> requires a variation of this, specifically in disposing of the body so it can't regenerate. You have to behead the creature, cremate the head and body separately, scatter the body's ashes over running water, immerse the head's ashes in holy water, and bury the immersed ashes in holy ground... and a vampire lord can recover from even this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">though not without help</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em>: many Darklords are given extremely specific conditions that the party must complete before they can successfully kill them, which can prove rather... annoying. It varies between individuals whether or not they can be "killed" or if they simply turn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Nigh Invulnerable</a> until the proper steps are followed.
</li><li> Similarly invoked in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Birthright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Birthright">Birthright</a></em>; one rare Blood power called "Invulnerability" makes it impossible for the possessor to be killed unless certain specific conditions are met. In "Blood Enemies", the sourcebook statting the most well-known Awnsheghlien, the only Invulnerable awnsheg whose method of death is explicitly stated is the Spider, who can only die if he is chopped into bits, those bits are then burned for a day on a fire fed with wood taken from the tree of a dryad, and the resultant ashes are then plowed into the earth with a large amount of salt.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>:
<ul><li> The backstory for Dogs of War character Borgio the Besieger survived several increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">over the top</a> attempts on his life, eventually being killed in the bath with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprovisedWeapon">toasting fork</a>.
</li><li> An even more outrageous Rasputinian death was Vlad von Carstein. He survived being chopped up with his own magical sword, being impaled on a dozen lances and being decapitated by a lucky cannon shot. His eventual demise only occurred after the Grand Theogonist of Sigmar threw himself and Vlad off the battlements in the siege of Altdorf, landing on a moat of sharpened stakes. Even then, Vlad only dies because Manfred stole his reincarnation ring. Otherwise, he probably would have just shoved the Grand Theogonist off of him and continued fighting.
</li></ul></li><li> Any <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> character with Supernatural Durability can theoretically take any amount of punishment before dying. Short of a weapon that vaporizes them in a single hit only one very specific method (e.g. a metal spike through the heart) can <em>ever</em> actually kill them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HollowEarthExpedition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HollowEarthExpedition">Hollow Earth Expedition</a></em>, any character with the Diehard talent automatically stabilizes when they reach negative hitpoints, stays conscious even with negative hitpoints, and increases the number of negative hitpoints they can reach before dying, thus meaning they're much tougher and harder to kill than characters without the talent. The high pain tolerance talent has similar effects, albeit less so, and combining them results in <em>even more</em> awesome effects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Both talents can be taken multiple times</a>.
</li><li> Many heroic characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> can take unbelievable amounts of punishment. Especially characters with the "Eternal Warrior" trait, which makes them immune to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">Chunky Salsa Rule</a>.
<ul><li> Marneus Calgar and Darnath Lysander each have a whopping four wound points, which, combined with the aforementioned Eternal Warrior rule, means they can each take at least four hits from heavy artillery before going down.
</li><li> Captain Alessio Cortez is the single least killable Space Marine in the Imperium, his feats including things like holding off a six-hour assault in spite of a broken back and cleverly getting an ork's weapon stuck in his ribcage to disarm it and then kill it. Every bone in his body has been broken at least once, which probably explains his attitude towards limb loss.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> I haven't lost an arm, brother. It's over there.
</div><ul><li> Commissar Yarrick has a rule where if he loses his last wound, he has a 2/3 chance of getting up again the next round. As opposed to every other 40K example, he's but a humble guardsman (meaning he's an unmodified Human, except for the artificial arm he ripped off from an ork) pushing into his early 80's/late 70's. He's able to shrug off a hit that would permanently put down Marneus Calgar, the guy with a rule called God of War, and the Avatar of Khaine, the Embodiment of an actual God of War. And all of this is supposedly through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">sheer determination and nothing else</a> (some canon hints that because he's the only human who's put up enough of a fight to impress Ghazkull, the fact that the orks believe him to be superhumanly tough <em>makes</em> him superhumanly tough).
</li><li> Old One Eye has a similar rule. It's the most powerful in the third edition, where he automatically regenerates one wound per turn (as oppose on a 4+ on a D6) and could stand back up if he was killed. He is drastically toned down for the new release.
</li><li> St. Celestine is supposed to have died dozens of times before finally being nuked. In game terms, she can stand back up within a couple of turns.
</li><li> Many newer characters possess a version of this rule. One of the first outside of Celestine was Chaplain Grimaldus of the Black Templars, although he had to pass a leadership test each turn or his will gave out and he would collapse. Justicar Anval Thawn takes it to the extreme, being able to come back from anything in the game and can continuously test for it even if he fails the first time around. This is very useful as, unlike the other examples, Thawn can claim objectives and so is a bane to the opponent during Objectives games.
</li><li> Possibly the very, very best version of this is the old 3rd edition version of the Fallen Dark Angel Cypher, who has a god looking out for him. When he loses his last wound and fails his armour save, Cypher gets a 4+ invulnerable save... On a <em>3d6</em>. It will only fail on the roll of three 1s, a 1/216 event. The remaining 215 times he simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokeOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokeOut">vanishes</a>, still alive and kicking, and the other side gets no victory points for killing him. It doesn't matter what you throw onto him; the odds of it actually doing something to Cypher is very low indeed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">By the lore</a>, Cypher has survived at least one Exterminatus (killing every last living organism on an entire planet) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye">vanished tracelessly</a> from a cell in a Black Templar battle barge.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Malifaux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Malifaux">Malifaux</a></em>, this is what many people ascribe to Leviticus, except he turns up later alive. Subverted however because Leviticus really does die every time he claims its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">Only a Flesh Wound</a>; missed his heart/the body can stand to lose that much blood/intestinal removal isn't fatal. This is because he's somewhat worked out the secret to eternal life, specifically eternal respawning. In game terms, he will die every other turn and reappear at the end of the turn he died. He can be permanently killed but it requires a lot of work to set up.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> Adventure Path <em>Reign of Winter</em>, you actually get to fight the man himself. You have to kill him three times in a row before he finally kicks the bucket. Naturally, this will likely involve a <em>lot</em> of stabbing, shooting, poisoning, clawing, burning, freezing, and/or electrocution, etc., depending on your party.

Alone and in a damaged mech, he held off the entire Comguard force as the rest of the Falcon Guard retreated to their dropship. He succeeded in personally killing 12 mechs, three of which he felled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">after his mech was down to a single small laser and his sensors were no longer working</a>.

During the Word of Blake Jihad, one of the writers wanted to do something with them, so they looked up the last planet they'd been deployed on.

And then impacted on the planets surface. <br/><br/>The medical scans shown during the montage of the resurrection process and Miranda's own lab notes reveal that that Shepard's body endured exposure to vacuum, the heat of reentry, exposure to subzero temperatures on the planet surface, as well as an impact that left most of Shep's skeleton shattered. It's no wonder it took them two years and a ludicrous amount of money to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRebuildHim">get Shepard back in working order</a>.

<ul><li> On the Unlimited Blade Works route, Archer loses most of his mana and gains a nasty arm wound from a duel with Lancer, and then breaks his contract. This normally means he would fade away from mana loss, except he has a class ability that lets him stick around for another three days. That's reasonable. After a day of mana leakage he gets into a fight with Shirou and gets impaled. Then Gilgamesh shows up and he gets impaled about twenty times MORE and a piece of the building collapses on top of him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldHaveSurvivedThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldHaveSurvivedThat">Everyone assumes at this point he's gone</a>. He shows up during the final battle a day later to rescue Rin and give the killing blow to Gilgamesh. And he still has enough time left to have a conversation with Rin before the Grail being missing removes any last anchors he has to the world.
</li><li> Lancer has this kind of death himself in Unlimited Blade Works, he is ordered by his master Kotomine to kill himself, which he does in spectacular fashion by stabbing himself in the heart with his Noble Phantasm, he then kills Kotomine with the same weapon before being brutalized by Shinji and only resists when Shinji threatens Tohsaka, he finally dies by lighting his funeral pyre and takes a whole castle with him. Since Lancer is actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology">Cu Chulainn</a></span>, who in life was so hard to kill that his enemies resorted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> to get the job done (and he <em>still</em> took ages to die and managed to get the last laugh even <em>after</em> he actually died) Kirei really should have known better.
</li><li> Berserker's Noble Phantasm, essentially 12 1-ups that each have to be removed in a different fashion, more or less makes this trope obligatory for him. It's subverted in two of the routes, but his death in Unlimited Blade Works, charging down at Gilgamesh as the latter kills him over and over with a never-ending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormOfBlades">Storm of Blades</a>, counts. And after losing all of his lives, he manages to create another life to try to protect Illya.
<ul><li> His death in Heaven's Feel is also spectacular. After being consumed by the Shadow and spat out as a blind, crippled version lacking its defensive Noble Phantasm, Shirou obliterates an eighth of its body with eight simultaneous attacks. That <em>still</em> isn't enough to kill Berserker, so he jams his sword through the heart.
</li></ul></li><li> Gilgamesh's death in Unlimited Blade Works. First, Shirou tears one of his arms off after Gil tries to pull out Ea. It doesn't even slow him down. Then, he's sucked into a BLACK HOLE courtesy of the Grail. He pretty much says "fuck that" and starts pulling himself out with his chain Enkidu, using Shirou as an anchor. THEN, Archer shows up and lobs a knife into Gil's face, going directly into his forehead. STILL doesn't kill him, it just distracts him for long enough to get eaten by the black hole.

What did it take to finally end ol' Drac? First, he needed to be challenged and defeated, like in many previous Castlevanias. Then, Julius sealed the holy Vampire Killer whip inside Castlevania, to weaken Dracula's power over the castle (which is the symbol of his power). And finally, Castlevania itself was sealed within an <em>eclipse</em>, to keep Drac's soul from ever reaching it again. It worked, though Drac reincarnated all the same. This time as a good guy, though.

Julius would, in theory, have to have found and destroyed it as well.

And in a classic case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>, one can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">cause such deaths</a> by hacking off limbs <em>slowly</em>.
<ul><li> This was especially the case with Undead. To start with, already being dead makes them impervious to common sources of death - they feel no pain, have no useful articulations to damage, ignore injuries to their now- useless organs, do not fall unconscious, and are impervious to the effects of morale. Only damage to critical parts, or sources of gib-worthy damage are effective. But the real Fun comes from the highly-detailed nature of the game. Specific body parts can be severed and subsequently reanimated (individual fingers, feathers, hair, liver, teeth, etc.), and the tiny targets can be literally impossible to hit. Sending in a dwarf with a sharp weapon (or using sharp traps) quickly compounds the problem. If your dwarf if skilled enough to avoid being hit and dying during the unending melee, they will instead become exhausted and die.

He survives, but has to become a cyborg.

Then, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">failed Caesar and the Legion</a> at the Battle of Hoover Dam, he's covered in pitch, lit on fire, and thrown into the Grand Canyon.

The best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Power Armor</a> in the game only has 28 DT, making Graham harder to kill than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Brotherhood of Steel Paladin</a> or a Deathclaw. His natural toughness also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">works against him</a>, however, in that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToDrugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToDrugs">Immune to Drugs</a> so painkillers don't do anything to relieve the constant agonizing pain from his burns.

This will usually fail. However, you can also reprogram the seven minigun turrets in the room and convince a squad of four Enclave soldiers armed with the most powerful guns in the game to help you. Meaning Frank's death will almost certainly consist of nineteen targets firing on him simultaneously with the most powerful weapons in the entire game until <em>finally</em> he goes down, likely after being shot thousands of times. Apparently, <em>this isn't enough</em>. So he gets shot more, torn in half at the waist (still being alive at this point), and finally <em>nuked</em>, with whatever's left of him sinking to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.

He <em>survives</em> that due to the Triforce of Power, and transforms into Ganon. Link fights him, slashes him in the tail many times, and finishes it off by cutting up his face and stabbing deeply into it. And he <em>still</em> doesn't die, instead having to be sealed away in what was once the Sacred Realm.

</li><li> A Gem in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> is an alien creature that, alongside being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedless">The Needless</a>, is impossible to kill. <em>Literally</em>. And even to reach the closest state of "death", someone has to pulverize the gemstone itself, usually after taking out the physical projection of their body first. Depending on whether or not the gem is a fighter and the type of gem, this part can be more or less easy to brutally difficult. At this point, you can disable a Gem by cracking the gemstone or "kill" a Gem by shattering it, and you can use it for powering technology and weapons, respectively. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">They'll still maintain full consciousness while this occurs.</a> In the case of shattered Gems, you can undergo the time-consuming task of gluing the pieces back together, though this results in some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Frankenstein's Monster with a broken psyche at the end of the process.</a> One episode plays this indestructible nature for laughs, with Peridot constantly being attacked and crushed in true Wile E.
