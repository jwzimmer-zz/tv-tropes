This is stated to be a trait of people from that planet; their guns barely tickle Tetsuro and he easily breaks floors by jumping around.

This isn't in itself a huge handicap that one could get around in any number of ways, but evidently his paintings look gaudy at best no matter what he does.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society of America</a></em>, Nate Heywood's dreams of becoming a football star were crushed when his kneecap was shattered and the injury became infected, necessitating the amputation of one of his legs. Even worse, it's mentioned his leg could've been saved had it been treated properly, and the amputation looks as though, as Dr. Mid-Nite puts it, it was done by a butcher. As luck would have it, an encounter with a supervillain later caused him to become covered in a living metal- the same process also restoring his lost leg- that allowed him to become the reluctant superhero Citizen Steel.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> was once an amazing surgeon. Then, he got into an accident that badly mangled his hands, leaving him unable to hold a scalpel steadily. He traded the scalpel for learning magic and became the Sorcerer Supreme instead. It's notable that in most modern interpretations, the injury wasn't even that bad and didn't prevent Strange from returning to surgery, but he was such an egomaniac he wouldn't accept even the most minor loss of skill and sunk his entire fortune into trying to be completely healed. The reason he originally sought out the previous Sorceror Supreme was in the hopes that magic could fix what science couldn't.

Notable is the man still insists he would have been a fine pilot because of his dedication and desire, not grasping the simple truth he was physically unfit to go into space.

</li><li> Downplayed with Rainbow Dash. She gets a broken leg early in the story during September, is in crutches for a month and out of her brace by Halloween. However she says she can still feel slight pain in her leg and needs to improve her game if she wants to be a pro. She says she still isn't back to 100% by July.

She applied to Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. As she's an earth pony with a tested IQ of 79, she got back a form letter noting a student would have to be "both gifted and a unicorn". (The "gifted" part seems to have been much more offensive; it's unclear how many of her later notable prejudices, including racial bigotry against unicorns, were already present in her home life.)

Ironically, the movie then violates this premise by having the Spartans break up their phalanx and fight individually, and, in any case, it's never quite explained why they couldn't have used him as a messenger or positioned him on the cliff and let him chuck spears as long as he could.

<ul><li> Bran Stark suffers from this in having dreamed about being a knight prior to being crippled.
</li><li> Gender roles are a running source of vexation for a number of female characters. Brienne of Tarth is constantly ridiculed for living the lifestyle of a knight. Asha has difficulty being taken seriously as a leader of the Ironmen for being a woman. Arya is always getting into trouble for being a tomboy and must practice fencing under the guise of "dancing lessons". Cersei repeatedly curses being born a woman, which prevents her from ruling in her own right. Each of those cases is ultimately a subversion, though: Brienne is a knight for all intents and purposes, Asha is Captain of her own ship and gets more respect from her father than her brother does, Arya becomes a formidable fighter and assassin, and Cercei becomes the true power behind her easily-led son Tommen. Being a woman makes a lot of things harder in Westeros, but it's not an insurmountable obstacle.

He ends up becoming a medicine cat instead.

Once the disease got worse and Brenda lost use of her arms, her daughter encourages her to dance with her voice instead, and after that goes, she can dance in her mind. When Brenda finally succumbs to the disease, she dances as a ghost, unhindered by paralysis and death.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>, Hank Hill was rejected from the military because of his narrow urethra, which means it takes him over twenty minutes to urinate. This holds up the restroom and would leave him vulnerable in the field. His dreams of professional football were also dashed when he snapped his ankle during a critical play in a State Championship game.
</li><li> Played for laughs in the first season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, when Cartman suspects Mr. Garrison of being his father, only for Garrison to point out that literally every man in the town has at some point had sex with Cartman's mother. A guy then pipes up and says that he hasn't slept with Mrs. Cartman, but Mr. Garrison says "You don't count, Halfie, you don't have any legs!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Scootaloo:
<ul><li> The show strongly implies that Scootaloo has a disability that prevents her from flying. "Flight to the Finish" directly states that she should have learned to fly at her age, and earlier episodes have shown much younger Pegasi take to the air. When she does use her wings, she can only flutter a few inches off the ground. In "The Fault in Our Cutie Marks", she is determined to help the griffon Gabby to get her Cutie Mark despite her not being a pony since "[she] know what it's like to want something that's out of reach", which is probably the closest the show will get to acknowledge that it is supposed to be a handicap. When she's on her scooter, however, she can use her wings to pick up speed.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS8E20TheWashouts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS8E20TheWashouts">The Washouts,</a>" when Rainbow Dash tries to convince Scootaloo to look up to the Wonderbolts again, Scootaloo screams that she'll never be a Wonderbolt because she can't fly. Made worse since Rainbow Dash is always trying to convince Scootaloo to be the best she can beâ€”and Rainbow Dash explicitly sees the Wonderbolts as the best of the best. Scootlaoo snaps that this means she'll never be good enough. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Rainbow Dash clearly never realized what she was implying</a>.
</li><li> It's outright confirmed in <em>Growing Up Is Hard To Do</em> and <em>The Last Problem</em> where not only do we never see the adult Scootaloo fly, but her wings are <em>clearly</em> undersized to the point they apparently haven't developed past what they were when she was as a filly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has since <a class="urllink" href="https://trixiebooru.org/images/2157535">confirmed on Twitter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that yes she is disabled, but that fans are free to interpret it differently if they so wish.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also Sunburst, a unicorn who gained his Cutie Mark in magical theory, but doesn't have the power to back it up. He's so embarrassed by it, he hid out in the Crystal Empire until his old friend Starlight Glimmer comes along in the season six premiere "The Crystalling".
</li><li> There's an extremely downplayed example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Derpy Hooves</a>, if one looks closely at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulBackgroundEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulBackgroundEvent">Meaningful Background Event</a>: in "Parental Glideance", a flashback shows Derpy taking part in a series of flying competitions. In the first one, she <em>wins</em>, but places progressively worse and worse... as her infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishEyes">Fish Eyes</a> become more and more pronounced. Notably, she starts out ahead of several ponies (including Rainbow Dash) who ended up being Wonderbolts, implying that Derpy could've been one of the best flyers in Equestria if not for her eye problems. Adding to this is a brief flashback shot in "Where the Apple Lies" showing her with a bandage over her eyes, implying that she tried and failed to have her eyes fixed at one point. It's also a rarely positive case as, in spite of it, she's not only shown to be one of the happiest and contented characters in the series, but her popping up in the V.I.P. section of the Grand Galloping Gala, being present at the Royal Wedding, and being shown among an image of Canterlot's elite implies she's led a pretty successful life.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>â€”in season three, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun">Amethyst</a> learns that she has the Gem equivalent to a birth defect, and that she is actually supposed to be as tall and muscular as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">Jasper</a>. While initially believing that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsSomethingHesGotToDoHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsSomethingHesGotToDoHimself">she has to defeat Jasper alone</a> to prove herself, she gets repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStomp">Curb Stomped</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">Steven</a> eventually convinces her that they actually need to work together and beat her with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>.
</li><li> Played for laughs in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> episode "The Sponge Who Could Fly", where a fish mentions that he used to dream of being a concert pianist before realizing that he didn't have any fingers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em> Callum wants to be a mage, but refuses to learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">Dark Magic</a>, and as a human lacks connection to any primal arcanum, making him incapable of casting spells without an external power source. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Subverted when he succeeds in creating a connection to the storm arcanum quite quickly when he refuses to accept this limitation in the second season. With the introduction of Aaravos, an elf who can use all six forms of primal magic instead of just one, it seems the idea one must be born with the connection is simply a false belief that stops most people from trying.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FairlyOddParents">Fairly OddParents</a></em>: Parodied in "Miss Dimmsdale'' when Mr. Turner's dream of entering the Miss Dimmsdale competition is stymied by him... well, being a man. He insists that this is discrimination and that he intends to prove that "men can be beautiful too!" Ironically, he actually ends up winning, if only to keep a cheating Vicky from winning by default after crippling all the other contestants, and is crowned the first male Miss Dimmsdale.

<ul><li> Supermodeling. You could be the most attractive person in the world but you must be above 5ft 8 ins. There are some exceptions, but most supermodels below 5ft 8ins are something else as well like an actor, dancer, or singer. Also, you usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">can't be above a certain weight</a> (this is changing as concerns about anorexia are brought out more).
</li><li> In some cases, sperm donation. Clinics receive so many requests for tall donors that men under 6 feet are turned away.
<ul><li> In 2011, the world's largest sperm bank, in the United Kingdom, started turning down redheads. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild">Apparently nobody wants ginger kids</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Color-blindness is a showstopper for any professions in transportation. You cannot become a truck or bus driver, railroad engineer, airline pilot or a ship's master if you are color-blind.
</li><li> Epilepsy is a major deal-breaker for a large number of jobs. No matter what skills or capabilities you have, any unpredictable lapse in concentration will instantly doom any career that involves driving. This extends to careers in medicine, law enforcement, or fire emergencies. If you should have a seizure on the job and it might put you or others in danger, you will be considered unfit. And there are more jobs like that than you think.
</li><li> If you want to be in the Rockettes, you can't go being too <em>tall</em> either; dancers must be between 5ft 6in and 5ft 10in. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, when a Las Vegas revue featuring the Rockettes was hosted by singer-actress Susan Anton (who's 5ft <em>11in</em>), she lampshaded this with the interstitial song "Too Tall".
</li><li> To train at certain world-class ballet schools (perhaps most notably the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCityFormerlyKnownAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCityFormerlyKnownAs">St Petersburg</a>), young dancers have to fall within a certain height range (goes rather low for girls, and quite high for boys), as well as to maintain a certain build and body-weight (especially the girls, who also have to stay quite flat-breasted). Trouble is, most kids enter ballet training before they've reached full adult size and proportions, so a kid can sometimes get in only to fall into this trope later. Proportional measurements and X-rays help the panel make a guess at how much a kid is going to grow before they stop, but it's still a bit of a gamble.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0wq4v');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0wq4v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0wq4v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Many students with otherwise excellent technique who end up not fitting the physical requirements are trained instead as teachers and/or choreographers, lessening the sting a little bit.</span>
</li><li> Even in amateur-level dancing, e.g. ballroom, things will be considerably easier if your partner is a good height match, otherwise you'll have to adjust your hold and step length, and probably won't be considered to look as good at it.
</li><li> The American military:
<ul><li> They reject people for having certain disabilities, such as deafness. The <em>very</em> rare exceptions usually have some necessary or exceptional ability, such as the WWII Army soldier with a punctured eardrum. He'd grown up as part of a Japanese-American family and spoke the language fluently.
</li><li> Though not quite within the limits of the trope, there are a LOT of mental disorders that will completely bar you from service, no ifs, ands or buts.
</li><li> Transgender people were also barred from service, until June 30, 2016. They can now serve openly, though the enlistment had been obstructed on-and-off again since 2017.
</li><li> The United States Air Force only trains pilots who stand between 5'4" and 6"5". Because they don't make fighter jets in more than one size. Fighter pilots also must have perfect vision without correction (glasses or contacts); flight officers, the ones who control the onboard weapon and navigation systems, can have corrective lenses, but their vision must be <em>correctable</em> to 20/20.
</li><li> The Old Guard (3rd US Infantry Regiment) has a strict height range for those serving as honor guards at Arlington Cemetery (these are the ones you see at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and funeral duties).
</li><li> Previously, people with color blindness were highly sought after in the military. Most forms of human-constructed camouflage depend on color effects, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">people without normal color vision can usually see through without difficulty</a>. Modern imaging systems and photography have largely eliminated the need for this, as it allows anyone to have abnormal color vision.
</li></ul></li><li> Romantic-era composer/performer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertSchumann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertSchumann">Robert Schumann</a> did this to himself: he designed a machine to help extend the range of his right hand. Instead he damaged it forever, thus ending his public performance career (he continued with the compositions, though).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueManGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlueManGroup">Blue Man Group</a> requires its performers to be between 5'10" and 6'1" with an athletic build.
</li><li> Defied by Jim Abbott, former MLB pitcher who was born without a right hand. To get around this, Abbott would rest a right-handed thrower's glove on the end of his right forearm. After releasing the ball, he would quickly slip his hand into the glove, usually in time to field any balls that a two-handed pitcher would be able to field. Then he would remove the glove by securing it between his right forearm and torso, slip his hand out of the glove, and remove the ball from the glove, usually in time to throw out the runner.
<ul><li> In his final year, he played in the National League for the first time, which meant he had to hit occasionally. How'd he do? 2 singles, 3 runs batted in, and 3 sacrifice bunts. One handed. That's better than a lot of two-handed pitchers can do.
</li></ul></li><li> Defied by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Allen_%28drummer%29">Rick Allen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, drummer of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard">Def Leppard</a>, who lost his left arm, but continues to drum for the group using a combination of rapid armwork and a custom drum setup to let him play the snares with his left foot.
</li><li> Defied by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Pistorius">Oscar Pistorius<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who doesn't have legs and yet competed as a sprinter and relay runner in the 2012 Summer Olympics (among many other events for both able-bodied and disabled individuals).
</li><li> Defied by Douglas Bader who lost both legs in a flying accident, was told he would never fly again, flew again, became an RAF ace, made 20 confirmed kills, was shot down over occupied France, escaped from POW camps several times, and was finally imprisoned in Colditz where he remained for the rest of the war (despite several further escape attempts, including taking off his prosthetic legs so that he could fit in a very small box). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">It's safe to say that his paraplegic condition didn't slow him down at all.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Satanism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Satanism">Laveyan Satanism</a> (really more of a common sense philosophy with ritualistic elements added) makes use of this trope as one of its core principles, the "balance factor." You are supposed to feel free to accomplish anything you want, as long as you don't infringe on the rights of others to do the same; but assess yourself honestly to make sure your goals are realistic. If your dreams cannot happen because of something that really cannot be changed, put your energy into other dreams you <em>can</em> accomplish, maybe in the same field. And, as with the "defied" examples, make sure your dreams <em>really</em> can't work out before you give up. You may surprise everyone.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">There would've been three Manning Brothers</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">National Football League</a> in the 21st century if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton</a> and Eli's oldest brother Cooper, who was an all-state wide receiver during his high school days in Mississippi and was considered a hot prospect recruit for Ole Miss, hadn't been diagnosed with a spinal condition that ended his playing days.
