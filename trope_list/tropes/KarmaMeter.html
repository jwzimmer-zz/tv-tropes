Actions taken within the game affect the player, and sometimes how the player is treated by the plot and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPC</a>. This happens even if there were no witnesses to the action and no circumstances that point to you. Some games will make it impossible for one to continue if their Karma Meter is too low, or give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">bad ending</a>. Others will simply result in the character having an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">evil alignment</a>" and playing this way.
</p><p>In some games, it doesn't matter whether you're good or bad but how far you lean to one side is rewarded — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPointsForNeutrality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPointsForNeutrality">there are bonuses for being very good or very evil but not moderate</a>.

</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Furthermore, games with a Karma Meter often include a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">Golden Snitch</a> decision that will heavily push you towards (or even lock you <em>permanently</em> in) one extreme of the morality gauge <em>regardless</em> of your actions up to that point. This means that in a game with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondEndingChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondEndingChoice">your ending is decided more by that one single choice rather than an accumulation of all of your deeds and misdeeds</a>.
</p><p>Except for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">Golden Snitch</a> event, typically no act is more than three to five times more evil or good than any other. This leads to the odd situation where a character with a perfect record of finding lost pets and helping old ladies with their groceries can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">bludgeon a school bus of Girl Scouts to death and pour napalm on their corpses while singing hymns to Satan and scarfing down a stack of Kitten Burgers</a> and at worst go from "saintly" to "very good" on the Karma Meter. And unless the Karma changes are limited to plot events, go right back to "saintly" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">killing some monsters</a> or giving money to beggars.

The player makes hundreds or even thousands of choices over the course of a game, and developing the game to include direct, ongoing consequences for <em>all</em> those decisions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreakFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreakFromReality">would be extremely taxing from both a writing and programming perspective.</a> Thus, for the sake of feasibility, many developers just stick with this trope, having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a> and game world react less to each <em>specific</em> choice you're making and more to your current position on the Karma Meter instead, allowing the player lots of flexibility in how they choose to play while avoiding the rigorous workload demands that the equivalent amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBranching">Story Branching</a> would entail. (That said, plenty of games use both tropes, and games that go the whole nine yards and give nearly all your specific choices lasting consequences, such as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> series, aren't unheard of, either.)

<ul><li> Perhaps surprisingly for a game where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">the entire premise is being evil</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overlord">Overlord</a></em> has a karma meter in the form of the "corruption" meter, which essentially gauges whether you're a totally self-serving, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a> Evil madman or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a> who helps out the public to earn their support while on your quest for revenge.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OverlordII">Overlord II</a></em> switches over to a Tyranny system with the extremes of "Destruction" and "Domination." Destruction is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> mass murderer again, but Domination is less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> and more cruel slavemaster, treating those around you as tools and pawns — while using mind control to ensure they <em>love you for it</em>. Either route is balanced in an appropriate fashion; Destruction usually gives an large one-time payout, while Domination grants a continuous flow of income and equipment for your Minions. It's the difference between pillaging a town and leaving it a smoking crater, or enslaving all the townsfolk and forcing them to slave for your Evilness for the rest of their lives.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Samurai Warrior: The Battles of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo">Usagi Yojimbo</a></em> (based on the comics), there was a literal karma meter on the top of the screen that could be increased by, among other things, bowing to those of a lower social class than you. It could also be decreased by, among other things, killing people unprovoked. If your karma falls below zero, you commit seppuku.
<ul><li> It had a useful effect. When you died and started a new game, the meter allowed you to start further into the game. In fact, it was possible to manipulate it high enough that you could start a new game at a point you hadn't reached previously!
</li></ul></li><li> Negative karma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheAdventuresOfRobinHood">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPunishment">gives you the bad ending</a> as villagers beat you to death.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DantesInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DantesInferno">Dante's Inferno</a></em> game (loosely based on Dante's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em>) has a gameplay mechanic that lets you absolve or condemn most demons you fight or lost souls you come across; Absolving grants you Holy XP, which powers up your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">Cross</a>, which acts as the focus for your magic spells, while Punishing earns you Unholy XP, which lets you buy more combat moves for your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterScythe">Scythe</a>. Neither choice has any effect on the story. In fact, in order to get the most out of your abilities, you want to do both holy and unholy actions so you can unlock all of your moves, cross and scythe.
</li><li> The infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrJekyllAndMrHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrJekyllAndMrHyde">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></em> for NES makes progression in the game itself be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>, specifically how far Jekyll and Hyde get relative to each other. Normally, you play as Jekyll, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelplessGoodSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelplessGoodSide">Helpless Good Side</a> who can only defend against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">myriad townspeople out to get him,</a> but if his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter">stress meter</a> fills up from being hit enough, he will transform into Hyde, who gets to fight off demons in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorWorld">Mirror World</a>. However, if Hyde catches up to Jekyll, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">Bolt of Divine Retribution</a> strikes him down and the game ends. The twist in this particular game's interpretation is that Jekyll's gameplay is so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">slow, tedious, and frustrating</a> that players would naturally want to play as Hyde despite the risk. Indeed, the game actually encourages playing as Hyde because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a> for the game requires him to make it all the way to the end (otherwise, you get a boring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWinnerIsYou">A Winner Is You</a> screen).

<ul><li> Starting at the end of the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em> game, there was a special class (Paladin) instead of the standard three (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FighterMageThief">Fighter, Mage, Thief</a>) for individuals who made the right decisions in previous games and transferred their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a>. Notable in that there's really no evil ending. Honor for the paladin was simply a matter of, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">honor</a>. Killing an unarmed opponent was a hell of a lot easier, and faster (at a point in the game where you're running out of time <em>very</em> quickly), than letting him pick up his sword to continue the battle, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">it sure wasn't honorable</a>. Also notable in that the Paladin wasn't more <em>powerful</em> than the Fighter, just different, and usually with an assortment of quests or choices that weren't available to anyone else. Screwing up or refusing these quests degraded the Paladin to a <em>weaker</em> version of the Fighter. Of course, in every game except the first, losing meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>, so it's not like siding with the villains is really an option.

Keeping it high by performing good deeds (or at least not performing many bad ones) allows you to end each character's scenario on a relatively high note by dealing with their personal demons, dying with dignity, and frustrating the efforts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer">Master Computer</a> AM at torturing them.

The white angelic meter monitors how good you are; the red devilish meter monitors how bad you are. Actions and dialogue choices throughout the game will affect one or the other, but you can also spend experience points on raising the bar of your choice. Although this has little impact on the ultimate outcome of the game, certain courses of action will not be available to you if one of the meters is too high; for example, being too good will render you incapable of knocking out a character and stealing his uniform to wear as a disguise.

In the lab, there is a blackboard, with chalk lines on it. The number of lines depend on your character answering three particular questions in certain ways, and your character's actions regarding three other things. A blank blackboard gets you the worst ending, one or two gets you the slightly less bad ending, three or more gets you the "good" ending...

Each task has multiple solutions, and the hidden Karma Meter is based on whether you choose to solve them by destroying things or placing yourself in harm's way, or in more creative ways. The Karma Meter doesn't really affect any of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>, but it does noticeably change the tone of these endings, as well as the girl's overall attitude after claiming the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>: a girl who solves all problems in non-destructive ways is happy to return home to her master and travels to other places only because of wanderlust, a girl who solves some (but not all) problems with violence and/or self-harm is more conflicted between returning home to her master or flee to a place where she won't be a slave, and a girl who uses destruction all the time hates having to return to her servitude and is all too glad to escape to another world or even commit suicide.

Order represents how firmly you keep the peace in Lander County. Honor represents how fairly you deal with others and whether you refrain from creaming off money for yourself. Law represents how closely you stick to the law.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">Zork</a> III</em> has a very primitive karma system designed to test your worthiness; your accessible score shows only how many times you've been tested, while a hidden second score records how many times you've passed. A perfect score is required to even <em>access</em> the last puzzle. This is particularly odd, since the player is only required to display trust, patience, compassion, mercy, etc. in <em>this</em> part of the dungeon — in the previous two games following these virtues would be suicide.

There's usually more than one way to resolve a problem during the game's flashback sequences, leaning towards one of these virtues, and the one Graham chooses most often influences how characters react to him (some characters are more receptive to displays of a particular virtue and others less so), and also influences Gwendolyn, his granddaughter, and how she behaves in her own story.

It is really easy to enter Shabai status as you beat up other folks with weapons, destroy property, and cause terror to the average joes, and just attacking without warning will make you hated quickly. It also determines which peons you can use in the 3rd series. The 4th game allows you to call any peon regardless of alignment.

Where you land on the scale depends on your actions during races — for instance, deliberately crashing other drivers will move you to the Villain end.

However, if you can win enough races, the fans won't care whether you're a Hero or a Villain.

There aren't many ways to affect your Karma Meter negatively; you're relegated to either selecting Dark Side powers (which unless you do so exclusively generally won't turn you dark), or killing every civilian and noncombat droid you come across, or some combination of both.

The first option earns you twice as much ADAM from each Little Sister, but the second option nets you occasional gifts from a benefactor who wants you to save them, in the form of ADAM and special plasmids. Whether you save or harvest Little Sisters also determines which of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> you get. This meter is terribly unforgiving: harvest just two of 21 Little Sisters and you earn the game's opprobrium. There are, however, two voiceover files recorded for the bad ending in <em>Bioshock</em>. Both have the exact same text, but the tone of voice is entirely different; if you only gave in to your lust for ADAM once, Dr. Tenenbaum sounds weary and resigned when describing your descent into evil, but if you've killed multiple Little Sisters, she's filled with righteous fury at you.
<ul><li> The aforementioned gifts actually render the karma meter meaningless, because it actually makes the choice mathematical rather than ethical — killing the Little Sisters gets you more ADAM <em>now</em>, but freeing them gives better rewards in the long run, in the form of more ADAM, plus plasmids and tonics you either no longer have to buy, or couldn't buy to begin with. Not to mention you can also break the system by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">causing a pair of extra Little Sisters to spawn</a>, allowing you to reap the immediate rewards of harvesting two of them and still go for the good ending.

You could then follow Compassion or Justice by letting the thief go or having him face the punishment for his crime. To further muddle the issue, if you returned the stolen item, you would learn that the quest-giver is not the legitimate owner, which in turn gives the choice between Honor in sticking to the original agreement or Honesty in delivering the item to its proper place.

The good side, Chivalry, is cultivated by things like freeing prisoners and keeping cities happy. This is rewarded by increasing happiness and population growth of a city when the general is managing it, and increasing the morale of all soldiers under his command. The evil side, Dread, comes from executing prisoners, excessively taxing populations, arranging many many assassinations, and more. This increases public order when garrisoned in a city and decreases the morale of all troops fighting against him. Given that soldiers that flee are likely to be captured and executed when facing an evil general, you'd think it would be the other way around...Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbIsGood">Dumb Is Good</a> is in effect here. "Chivalrous" tactics seem to consist of sending your army head-first against the enemy, but if you decide to skirmish, out-flank, or God forbid attack your enemy from the rear, your generals will quickly pick up "Cruel and Cunning" or similar traits. And for some reason, using Spies to keep tabs on your enemy's movements is also evil. You certainly can have multiple generals throughout your forces, so there's nothing wrong with having your maximized Dread general sweep aside your opposition while a maximized Chivalry general arrives on his heels to build the new territory up. Even more annoying is how your diplomatic reputation works on the world map — you can go the entire game without starting a single war, but if you fight back against your enemy or take their cities in retaliation, you'll quickly be saddled with a reputation as an untrustworthy monster.

Naturally, actions reflective of or favoring a particular religion increase it respective. Rightful is increased from merciful or even-handed actions while Tyrant is increased through brutality and under-handedness.

It also affects the ending you get in the game. Each of your fellow Space Marine also had their own Corruption meters, which also granted them access to Chaos-tainted gear and Chaos powers. Failing to take them along on certain missions or failing to fulfill certain mission objectives would also increase their Corruption, such as with Cyrus if you left him behind when the chapter's scouts were being attacked (since he personally taught most of them).

Actions like breaking alliances (both political ones as well as ones formed through marriage), attacking nations with the same religion, and spies being found out have a negative influence. Increasing your Kingdom power is only possible by spending gold and piety on it.

While there are some actions that affect the meter differently based on your alignment (chaotic characters get a bonus for sleeping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">succubi and incubi</a>) and role (knights get a penalty for attacking fleeing or sleeping monsters), the biggest impact is the same for all characters: killing hostile monsters usually boosts (and never penalizes) the meter, and killing peaceful monsters always penalizes it. That's right, the game considers a chaotic character bathing in the blood of innocent bystanders a bad thing (since letting chaotic characters get away with killing peaceful monsters would break <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitiveBalance">Competitive Balance</a> with regards to players choosing which alignment to play).

Shuffling around within an alignment (for example, NL to N+ to N= to N- to NC are all considered Neutral) isn't much of a problem, but woe betide the player who accidentally changes alignment (such as from NC to CN — you're now considered Chaotic) late in the game... because the nicer you've been to one god, the more the other two will hate you. There is also an artifact which is only granted to players that reach the bottom of the Caverns of Chaos without ever committing one chaotic act OR letting one lawful creature die.

Remarkably, this first use of a karma meter is still one of the very few where the choices are not just between good/evil, but also between different <em>types</em> of good, as all virtues weren't entirely compatible with each other.

You may choose to give him a small amount of cash, or threaten him <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0scw6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0scw6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0scw6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's implied that Kreia's influence is preventing you from just blowing the beggar off</span>. A brief dialogue with Kreia about unintended consequences follows; if the player chose to give the beggar money, the player sees the price of his benevolence (the beggar is now a target for a mugging). You still get light side points for giving to the beggar. A similar scene, in reverse, plays out if you threaten the beggar; he's frustrated by the way you treated him, and when another beggar talks to him, he snaps and attacks the guy. Additionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">your crewmembers have their own Karma meter that is influenced by the protagonist's own</a>... with special events unlocked for pushing theirs to the extremes. The funny thing is that if you make them hate the protagonist, their karma meter pushes to the opposite extreme of the protagonist's, which can ALSO unlock the special events... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">i.e. Force sensitive characters like Atton Rand can be trained to be Light Side Jedi if you're Dark Side, or vice versa... which allows for a much more varied array of skills in the party</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManLegends">Mega Man Legends</a></em> games have Mega Man's armor turning light or dark through certain actions. Kicking pigs and donating to the church were the biggest ones. It doesn't affect the plot, except for some dialogue and weapon opportunities. This was later elaborated on in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> games from <em>4</em> onwards, where Dark Chips ("evil" Battle Chips) darkened MegaMan's soul and lowered his HP by one point for every time he used one, in return for making them more readily available the more you use them (at positive karma they only appear when you're really in a bind; at sufficiently low levels, they're available whenever you want) and making them <em>incredibly</em> powerful, on par with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Program Advances</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em> had a Seal Rating and an Evaluation Rating that affected certain aspects of Lenneth's personality. While the Evaluation Rating didn't have any major effects, having the Seal Rating at a certain level at a certain point in the game unlocked the best ending, if certain other actions were also done. This was so specific and non-intuitive that many complained that one could only get the best ending by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">reading how to do it</a>. However, this has less to do with good and evil and more to do with how subservient/rebellious Lenneth is to Odin.
</li><li> The sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume">Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume</a></em>, is entirely based around a much more straightforward karma meter based on how many of your teammates you're willing to sacrifice for power. Sacrificing even a single one after the tutorial, though, makes it impossible to get the best ending.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em> had "The Way of the Open Palm" and "The Way of the Closed Fist" stand in for good and evil. They were presented as based on more subtle moral principles: the Open Palm stood for harmony, accepting one's position in life, and helping others accept theirs by supporting them, while Closed Fist stood for chaos, seeking to rise above one's station, and encouraging others to do the same by teaching them self-sufficiency (harshly if necessary). However, with a few exceptions, this still comes down to being a goody two-shoes or an amoral bastard. Not to mention that your final karma score <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondEndingChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondEndingChoice">depends on a single action near the end of the game...</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SkiesOfArcadia">Skies of Arcadia</a></em> has the "Swashbuckler Rating", which measures not just your karma in the traditional sense but also your adventurousness and leadership skills. The rating was underused in the game itself, as it only affected one or two sidequests. It's an interesting example even though it's underused, as it's not really a decision between "good" and "evil" so much as "good captain" or "bad captain". The game encourages a balance between daring and consideration of your crew — you have to consider each question carefully, as too far along the scale of "bold and daring" becomes "foolish and reckless", but too cautious becomes "cowardly".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a></em> features both a fame rating and a notoriety rating for the player. The former is increased by doing deeds that make you popular, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> tend to like you better the higher it is. The latter is increased with doing crimes and getting caught, and by completing theft and assassination quests. Though it makes no sense, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> will dislike you for doing these quests even if you were never caught or even seen, because they somehow know that you are a criminal even if you have never been arrested or even implicated in anything. Although there is a way to remove all infamy (it's necessary for a certain quest chain) as well as an item that gives you a new identity, preventing you from gaining any for real if you're wearing it, although it does set your infamy to 250 while you're wearing it, and all guards attack you on sight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> only offers a general karma meter. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> has the karma meter, plus an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter">Alliance Meter</a>. They also feature a series of status elements such as "grave robber", "child killer", and "slaver", depending on the choices made. Certain characters will react differently to different combinations of these — for example, some stores will only sell to people with negative karma, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">but still balk at selling to a child murderer</a>. The only truly bad effect of negative karma turns up in <em>Fallout 2</em>, in which towns will pay for bounty hunters to attack the player — but killing bounty hunters results in a further drop in karma, creating an unstoppable downward spiral...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> has drawbacks for both negative AND positive karma — Talon Company Mercenaries will begin randomly spawning to attack you if your Karma hits Very High, while Regulators will start gunning for you if your Karma hits Very Low. Talon Company mercs are rather nasty, spawning with energy weapons, Combat Armor, and high-quality assault rifles, even if you're level 4 (then again, having better equipment means better loot to pilfer off their corpses.) If there's a single subversion in <em>Fallout 3</em> of this trope, it's the Impartial Mediation Perk that offers +30 Speech...so long as you are Neutral. This is the <em>only</em> benefit offered in the game for staying Neutral, if you don't count the ability to recruit a few Neutral-only companions and avoiding energy weapon death at the hands of Talon Company Mercs or Regulators. Of course, any given trip through the subways of DC is going to result in some unintentional added saintliness for the simple fact that killing Feral Ghouls, which are everywhere in the metro stations, adds a little bit of positive karma.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> retains the karma meter from <em>3</em>, and it adds a faction system similar to <em>2</em>. The karma meter, however, really doesn't do much; one companion will leave you if it gets too low, and it influences the ending cutscenes, but that's it. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllianceMeter">Alliance Meter</a> is far more important. It actually takes a considerable effort (generally through stealing owned items or repeatedly using an owned computer) for your karma to be anything besides "Very Good", as you get loads of good karma for killing feral ghouls and Fiends, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcodedHostility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardcodedHostility">which always attack you</a>, and Powder Gangers, which you're likely to be on the bad side of.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> completely removes karma, partially because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCampaignForTheWicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCampaignForTheWicked">your ability to play as an evil character is pretty severely limited</a> (except in <em>Nuka-World</em>) and partly because the devs realized it wasn't being used very much in <em>3</em> or <em>New Vegas</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> has reputation. A higher reputation results in some stores offering discounts, while a sufficiently low reputation might result in the random appearance of guards to hunt you down. Reputation also determines which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sidekick">sidekicks</a> would stay on your team and which powers you develop (healing or damage-based). If your reputation drops below 10, you also become Fallen if you're a Paladin or Ranger. It's also possible to change your alignment without altering your reputation, in the Hell demiplane you go to at the end of the second game, which may exist primarily in your own head. For example, yelling at Sarevok that you'll transform into the Slayer turns you evil - even if you don't actually do it. And this doesn't have the same effects as reputation. You can spend the entirety of the Throne of Bhaal as an officially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> paladin, retain all paladin abilities against the rules of the universe, had a reputation of twenty, and have never really done anything evil.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em> has a two-dimensional meter based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">alignment</a> concept (the familiar Good-Evil and Lawful-Chaotic scales). The hero begins as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> and adjusts depending on your actions. The most notable feature in Torment was perhaps that dialog options had such diverse elements as "Truth: 'Tell me, or I'll kill you!'" and "Bluff: 'Tell me, or I'll kill you!'" which would affect alignment differently, but NPCs similarly. The next-most notable feature was how evil you could actually be.

At certain points in the game, the main representative of each philosophy straight-out asks if you agree with them, and later asks for a confirmation. Answering in the affirmative twice locks you into that ending, unless you do it with more than one path, in which case the game looks at how you answered certain questions posed throughout the game and tallies up your affinity score for each philosophy. There is also a sixth ending that you get locked into if you complete the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusLevelOfHell">Bonus Level of Hell</a>.

If you're heavily tilted towards Law or Chaos, then you're locked into that ending; otherwise, you get some questions at the end of the game to determine your ending (which basically boil down to, "Hey, you want this ending or what?").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse">Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse</a></em> downplays this trope. Getting the ending you want is a simple matter of picking obvious dialogue choices: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Joining Merkabah</span> for Law, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">joining Lucifer</span> for Chaos, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">opposing Dagda's offer in the Cosmic Egg</span> for Bonds, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">accepting the same offer</span> for Massacre. Instead, the morality check is used to slam a massive penalty onto you if your dialogue choices don't match with the ending you want: joining Bonds when the game deems you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> will cause all of your demons to be confiscated, while joining Massacre when the game deems you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> will cause all of your items to be taken away.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> included a clever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">reconstruction</a> on the karma meter with the Paragon/Renegade system. Rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">good and evil</a>, the meter represents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVSCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVSCynicism">idealism and cynicism</a>. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">Yahztee</a> put it, Paragon represents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Captain Picard</a> and Renegade represents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a>. Certain actions and dialogue choices can gain you Paragon points or Renegade points. Depending on where you are, you're given points in either the Charm or Intimidate skills, and your choice towards the end of the game affects what ending you receive. Although "playing both sides" leaves your character weaker overall in the Charm and Intimidate departments than if you'd specialized, the choice is there, unlike the games which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPointsForNeutrality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPointsForNeutrality">effectively penalize you for not picking one side all the way</a>.

</li><li> The problem with the series' morality system, however, is that the Paragon choice is almost always the right choice to make. While the Renegade options tend to be more immediately satisfying, they offer no long-term gain. Do you let the hostages die because you can't be arsed to save them, or spend little extra time in taking out the bad guys so that their captives live? Do you kill the mysterious alien creature in cold blood because it <em>might</em> pose a threat, or let it live so that it becomes an ally? This is reflected in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, where your War Readiness Rating is <em>much</em> higher for a Paragon Shepard. The only choices where there's no definite right answer—like deciding which party member to save—are not part of the karma meter.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> does away with non-combat skills and makes your ability to intimidate or charm people based entirely on your Renegade and Paragon points, respectively. This has the unfortunate side effect of penalising you heavily for not always picking the same thing, or even taking a more neutral approach. It still does mean, though, that unlike most other games, you can take <em>occasional</em> opposite-alignment action without any problem whatsoever. Dedicated Paragon players, particularly, tend to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">a few favorite Renegade choices that are just too satisfying to miss.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, Paragon and Renegade occupy the same meter, unlike the previous 2 games. This allows morality choices to be made purely based on situational personal preference without penalisation. However some scenarios, especially late in the game, require that you've filled the meter to a certain extent to access the paragon/renegade responses. In essence, if you haven't done enough missions, the meter sometimes won't be high enough for you to talk your way out of trouble.
</li><li> The freeware RPG <em>Wilfred The Hero</em> divides spells into the ethical and unethical categories. Ethical spells increase your morality when used and require a sufficiently high morality rating to learn, and vice-versa for unethical spells. Unlike most examples, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">this has no effect on the plot</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura">Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura</a></em> has a Karma Meter ranging from -100 to 100, with the protagonist starting out at 0. Many different things within the game affect this meter, mostly your actions in regards to quests and other similar things, like killing evil monsters or going on a rampage through some town. Depending on the value, certain characters might want to (or refuse to) join you, you might get offered different responses in dialogue, and if you commit certain acts (such as attacking a Good aligned creature with a Good character in your party), it may result in them getting upset and eventually leaving the group. For some reason, evil actions include killing people in self-defense, fighting dirty cops who just murdered a civil rights activist, and honoring a demon-possessed man's request for you to kill him before he goes on another homicidal rampage.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Avernum">Avernum</a></em> trilogy has "reputation". Performing quests and other good deeds would raise it. Stealing or killing friendly people would lower it. Having a good reputation results in some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a> being more helpful. There's no benefit to having a low reputation. But then, you start the game with a fairly low reputation and are almost certainly going to end the game with a high one.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethergate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethergate">Nethergate</a></em> had a few spots where you could perform good or evil acts and eventually be granted a reward based on your choices.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geneforge">Geneforge</a></em> has a karma meter that determines what the factions think of you based on your words and actions. It essentially comes down to whether you support creation rights/the Rebels or creation control/the Shapers. Factions that share your view will be helpful to you and let you join them. Factions that don't will distrust you.

The Shapers are opposed to shaping yourself and using the Geneforge or canisters, and although the games give them reasons to come to an accommodation with your protagonist, some of them will still treat you with loathing, disdain, or fear if you show up with the characteristic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlowingEyesOfDoom">Glowing Eyes of Doom</a> of a canister user.

<ul><li> The main campaign, however, focuses exclusively on good vs. evil choices; acting purely lawful won't do a thing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Nonlawful</a> bards and barbarians, whereas behaving like a full-bore rebel won't make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood">paladin</a> lose their abilities.
</li><li> This problem is fixed in the expansions and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">sequel</a>. Subverting the law (usually by going back on your word or by stealing things) shifts your alignment to Chaotic, while upholding it (keep your word) shifts to Lawful. Good and Evil meanwhile shift depending on if you're good and evil, naturally.

Pushing either in one of the directions will alter character stats under certain circumstances and trigger events. In addition, altering an area's Karma Meter has an influence on enemies — pushing it towards the good end will weaken them, while pushing it towards evil will strengthen enemies and cause new types of enemies to appear... but will also increase the amount of Souls enemies give you, which act as both the game's currency and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a>.

<ul><li> All three games have the "Sin" mechanic. Every time the player either kills a non-hostile NPC or Invades another world and kills another player, they accumulate one point of Sin. This has no effect on the main game, but in multiplayer, it has consequences: players with high levels of Sin are targeted by a Covenant that seeks to punish evildoers, meaning they will get Invaded more often themselves. Although, many PvP'ers see this as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment">good thing</a>, since it means more multiplayer action. Sin can be cleansed by praying to a specific NPC (or a statue in <em>Dark Souls III</em>) and spending a very large amount of souls as penance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> only, Sin has another consequence. Normally, a player will never fall below 50% of their maximum health due to Hollowing. A player with a large amount of Sin will lose health more quickly and can fall below 50% health, making the game much more difficult for them while Hollowed.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> is one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> game that notably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">doesn't</a></em> apply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>.

The closest thing it has is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">friendship meter for each party member</a>.

On one hand, they will have an opinion of your actions even if they're not there to personally witness them (compared to <em>Origins</em> where you could just leave Morrigan at camp if you don't want to hear her complain every time you do something heroic). But on the other hand, it takes <em>very</em> specific circumstances to make someone leave the party or end a romance. Makes sense since every party member in the game specifically seeks you out and asks to join.

The meter has little actual effect on the game itself, beyond affecting how clients think of you (people interested in data theft won't hire Crackers, while people interested in hurting people won't hire Hackers). There's also one action you can take <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(stealing the data containing the identities of your fellow Uplink agents and selling it)</span> that will mark you as a Cracker and lock you there, no matter what actions you take thereafter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceSiege">Space Siege</a></em> sets this up as something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsVsStoicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsVsStoicism">Emotions vs. Stoicism</a> meter, with emotions as "good" and stoicism as "bad."

For example, if you did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">Pacifist Run</a> (or killed very few enemies besides the bosses), he'll say something about how he resisted the urge to abuse his power.

It's not a complete black-and-white meter, however; the description for the Magnanimous quirk acknowledges that it's perfectly possible to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution">do good deeds for selfish reasons</a>, and it's the very rare Magnanimous player who hasn't nonetheless done something morally questionable at <em>some</em> point in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a>-filled depths of the Neath.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> features this as a central game mechanic. The game is advertised as an RPG where no one has to die, and during battles, the player can choose to either "Fight" an enemy and potentially kill it, or "Spare" it and reach a peaceful resolution. The story has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a> and routes based on how many enemies you spare or kill, with a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PacifistRun">Pacifist Run</a> being completely possible (and encouraged). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is revealed near the end of the game that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">EXP</a> actually stands for "Execution Points", and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">LOVE</a> stands for "Level Of Violence". These stats essentially act as the game's Meter.</span>
<ul><li> The game's save files have hidden "Murder Level" (MDR) flags that range from 0 to 16.

Alphys ending which is achieved if less than 40 Hotland encounters are killed before moving on to Mettaton NEO, therefore MDR stops at 14. In this ending, Alphys picks up the phone right after Sans starts the call. She states that she takes care of what is left of the underground, hates the protagonist yet has been made a better person because of them, still doesn't want to talk about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">her past mistakes</a>, then ends by saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">I should have killed you</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">when I had the chance!</a>"</span>

There are a lot of oddities, particularly the loophole that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderInc">Assassin's Guild</a> contracts do not affect your alignment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RakenzarnFrontierStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RakenzarnFrontierStory">Rakenzarn Frontier Story</a></em> uses a point system for Lawful and Chaotic options, with certain answers adding or subtracting more points to one category than another. Gameplay-wise, this mostly influences how other characters interact with Makoto or how certain sidequests turn out. Interestingly, there's no neutrality option at all. Once the system is opened up, you'll always lean just slightly to one or the other and treated as such.
</li><li> A very primitive one exists in the old sword and sorcery game <em>Miracle Warriors</em> from the original Sega Master System. In addition to running into monsters in the field, the player could also encounter Merchants, White Mages and Travellers (as well as evil counterparts of the same). The characters were subject to the same "Attack" and "Talk" commands available in the player's menu. Under normal conditions, talking to said characters yielded beneficial results such as the merchant selling you monster items, the White Mage healing the hero and his party, and the travellers offering up advice. Surprisingly these characters were also fountains of exp if the player could kill them, something that starts out easy because said characters will waste turns demanding to know what you're doing. The catch was, the more you did this, the more word of your misdeeds gets around, causing the in game population to question how much you and your crew can be trusted. This results in the good characters attacking you on sight (the White Mage packs a wallop) and the towns actively tossing you out on your axe. While the evil counterparts do become friendlier (the actual monsters could care less either way) their boons are often just less useful versions of the good guys' (with the evil merchant even taking advantage of your inability to enter towns to gouge you for more mundane items). The only way to restore your karma to good is to go on a very long killing spree against the bad characters (and like his good counterpart, the Black Mage packs a wallop, but only offers up a tenth of the exp) and there is an overlap where neither side is willing to help you.

In game terms, this means the Knight will never attack yellow (neutral or fleeing) targets, while the Mercenary will <strong>always</strong> attack them, with the Soldier striking a balance in between. Your wingmen and enemy pilots will have various things to say about you depending on your position on the gauge, certain missions have different ace enemies based on your Ace style, and it's even given a nod in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> by your first wingman commenting on your Ace style at the start of the first mission.

In a strange way: it's possible to be a pirate (i.e. criminal) and a bounty hunter (i.e. criminal <em>hunter</em>) at the same time, depending on your reputation with specific factions and your actions. There were bonuses for maxing out your rating in a particular field, however, and it's not possible to do so at cross-ends (i.e. you can't max your pirate and bounty hunter rating at the same time). In reality, it's possible to max out three of the six available ratings, but you can choose which ones, resulting in the incredibly unlikely pirate-smuggler-protector, for example.

It's virtually impossible to get through the game with <em>no</em> infamy (or no nobility, for that matter), and it affects only a few optional missions, but it was still nice to know. They also kept track of your recognition by the two major powers. While the nobility and infamy ratings played this trope straight, the faction ratings were actually subversions. Technically, it is possible for players to lock themselves into one faction or the other a mission or two "early" if certain missions are played in a specific order, however on the vast majority of play-throughs, the player will have one specific point where they choose which side to join for the rest of the game, regardless of their prior approval ratings.

Interestingly, there are only a small handful of choices in the game that add to your trust with one faction while also taking an equivalent hit to your trust with the other, so it's neither difficult nor time-consuming to gain 100% favor with both the JBA and the NSA through the majority of the game. As seems to be the case with a lot of these games, your "good and evil" rating ended up depending on one action: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whether you kill your old friend and handler Lambert or the somewhat sympathetic but still entirely evil new friend in the JBA.</span> This is not possible in "Version 2" of the game (the version on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSixthGenerationOfConsoleVideoGames">sixth-generation</a> consoles), which has a "classic" tug-of-war meter, meaning you can't please both the NSA and the JBA. Also one of the few examples which discourages playing to extremes, since doing so means that you're either "in over your head" or in danger of blowing your cover and being exposed as a double agent (i.e., complete a loyalty test within a time limit or you fail the mission).

On the other hand, doing suspicious things around other students (carrying weapons, being covered in blood, acting insane, being witnessed committing murder, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">taking up-skirt photos</a>) will harm her reputation.

Heroism is accrued by completing missions and sidequests, rescuing prisoners, and expanding Mother Base; while Heroism is lost by being caught by enemies, having your Buddy get critically wounded, or having soldiers in your employ die or leave. A high Heroism score attracts highly-skilled volunteers to your army, and once you netting 150,000 points of Heroism, you'll gain the "Hero" status, allowing you to infiltrate nuclear-armed FOBs. On the other hand, Demon points are earned by killing soldiers or animals, critically wounding your own comrades, and having wounded enemy soldiers die when attempting to Fulton extract them. The more Demon points you build up, the more demonic your appearance becomes.

<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em> series has always had multiple endings (Known as Good+, Good, Bad, Bad+, and an extra, silly ending). In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill1">the first game</a>, which one you got was based on your choices in two key scenes, one of which required an unintuitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SideQuest">Side Quest</a> to achieve the Good endings. In later games, it was based on your performance throughout the game.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2">Silent Hill 2</a></em> took into account a number of factors during the game to deduce your ending, including (but not limited to) how often you ran around injured, how long you stayed around Maria, and whether or not you looked at certain items. It is the only game in the series that lacks a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">Golden Snitch</a> event that will push you heavily towards one of the endings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em> introduced an event that would more directly affect your Karma Meter: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Forgiving the confessor in the church</span> is considered a <em>severely bad thing</em>. If you so much as spat on a demon afterward (or before), you were pretty much guaranteed the evil ending, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Karma Meter doesn't measure good or evil, but your acceptance of your role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">God</a>. The confessor event is not about whether you're forgiving or vengeful, it's about whether you believe you have the power to absolve of sin.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4">Silent Hill 4</a></em> has two conditions that determine your ending: how infested Room 301 is, and whether or not <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eileen</span> dies during the final boss battle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillHomecoming">Silent Hill: Homecoming</a></em> has three yes/no events that determine your ending.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillDownpour">Silent Hill: Downpour</a></em> continued this, with scenes offering a choice of whether to behave kindly or cruelly towards other characters. The player's responses combined with the number of enemies killed during the game determined which of four endings you'd get (with a fifth silly ending unlocked by finding hidden items throughout the game).

This rating determines which of three endings (Good, Neutral, or Evil) you get. While the meter isn't shown explicitly, the player can to some extent gauge their karmic state by the reactions that the ghost of his wife and children have to his actions. Not only that, but the player can see what their karma is at any time in two ways: looking at Torque, and looking at a photo of his family. If the player is good, Torque is nice and clean (save for the blood he got on him from previous fights) and looks fine, while the photo is fine. If the player is neutral, they are a bit dirty and have a couple scratches on them, and the photo is somewhat damaged. If the player is evil, Torque is covered in scars and sores, and the photo of his family is burned and increasingly faded. Torque will also change appearance based on your actions. A third way to tell is to listen to the Infernas on the occasions you meet them before they start showing up as enemies. If you're on the good route, they'll be relatively friendly and compassionate. If you're on the evil route, they'll be insulting and mocking, pretending to be afraid of you. The sequel, <em>The Suffering: Ties That Bind</em> has a similar system, though this time actually visible in the pause menu and having concrete bonuses, and even includes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a> that changes the opening depending on which ending you got in the first game.
<ul><li> The original game also has a ghostly NPC symbolizing each of the possibilities on the Karma Meter: Good is represented by Horace Gage, the ghost of a minor convict driven insane by his time on Carnate and ultimately executed in the electric chair for killing his wife on a conjugal visit, who wants to stop Torque from succumbing like he did; Neutral is represented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProjectedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProjectedMan">Dr. Killjoy</a>, a deranged psychiatrist dedicated to "helping" his patients no matter the cost, and has now adopted Torque as his latest project ; and representing Evil, Hermes T Haight, a sadistic executioner who eventually killed himself in the gas chamber so he could see death from the other side, and now sees a possible kindred spirit in Torque.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReservoirDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ReservoirDogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></em> has a meter that determines whether you're merely an amoral, businesslike Professional like the movie's Mr. Pink, a Career Criminal like Mr. White, or a psychopath like Mr. Blonde. This is affected by whether you shoot people at random or try to take hostages and escape peacefully. While all the other characters' fates are sealed, the karma meter determines what happens to Mr. Pink - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">psychopaths get shot by the cops, career criminals get arrested, but professionals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">Know When to Fold 'Em</a> and escape scot-free (possibly making off with the diamonds, too)!</span>

One is the standard good-vs-evil Alignment trait, and each soldier has it. Each soldier also has Charisma, which represents how badass they look (kill enemies above your level, you look awesome, kill much weaker foes, you just look like a thug). These traits are used to determine what classes a unit can change into. The third meter, called Chaos Frame, is your revolution's reputation as a whole, is affected by a whole raft of things, and determines what characters will join you and what ending you'll get.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em> averts this for characters, replacing it with a Law-Neutral-Chaos system of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a> that doesn't use a meter, but has a quasi-visible Chaos Frame that only affects which way you get screwed over in one ending.

This affects the ending in some of the games. The latest game allows you to follow a different path of the story after beating the game to be a bad guy. (Oddly, only demons are actually punished by the plot for doing this; humans get power-ups.)
</li><li> The turn-based strategy game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShatteredUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShatteredUnion">Shattered Union</a></em> features a "political rating" that fluctuates based on how much collateral damage you cause while conquering territories. Both the good and evil ends of the meter offer various special abilities. Being the good guy earns you the ability to spawn commandos and cyborg soldiers, heal and repair units, and temporarily make units faster and tougher. Having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>, meanwhile, gives you access to things like artillery strikes, biological weapons, and nukes. Your political rating also affects the ending you get. If you're good, America is peacefully reunited, and everybody lives happily ever after. If you were evil, you become the new fascist dictator.

Eventually, a hero will be offered the chance to devote themselves to a philosophy, which will earn them unique abilities; for example, a warlock who pursues tears will become a demonist who can support their army through summoning, while a blood warlock becomes a pyromancer who gains unique destruction spells.

As the recipient of superpowers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Cole MacGrath</a> (and later Delsin Rowe in <em>Second Son</em>) have to choose whether to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility">use them to help others</a>, or to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">only help himself</a>. Notable in the fact that helping people will usually <em>hurt</em> you, with a long (but temporary) effect. Hurting innocents will still give you negative Karma, but it's possible to be extremely evil just by looking out for number one.
<ul><li> Early examples in the first game include scaring off citizens to secure a supply drop of food all for yourself, or letting them take their fair share; attacking police on your own, or inciting a riot to let bystanders take some of the heat; and turning off a water supply valve which poisons you, or getting some hapless oaf to get poisoned for you. Generally speaking, evil equates to "selfish", and good equates to "selfless". Your Karma directly affects how your powers develop, and both the Good and Evil sides have unique powers as well.
</li><li> Like several other games listed here, your final Karma, as well as the ending received, are determined by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondEndingChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondEndingChoice">a specific choice just before the final boss</a>. There's an interesting spin on it, though; the story event involved in taking the evil choice can leave absolutely <em>no doubt</em> about Cole's malevolence. Even if you make this choice with full positive karma at "Hero", <em>the Karma Meter drops to and locks at "Infamous"</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrimeStreetsOfLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrimeStreetsOfLA">True Crime: Streets of L.A.</a></em> has a karma meter that plays on the concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodCopBadCop">Good Cop/Bad Cop</a>. Simply arresting random criminals (you may incapacitate them to make it easier) will raise it towards the "Good Cop" side, while shooting them dead leans you towards "Bad Cop"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12lkr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12lkr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12lkr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unless they're armed and shooting at you, in which case you get neither good nor bad points</span>.
<ul><li> Somewhat annoyingly, in order for you to advance beyond a certain point, you needed to be at "Good Cop", which meant there was no separate path or ending for playing as a Bad Cop. Not to mention that if you got carried away, it would be almost impossible for you to return to good cop without grinding for arrests in order to score some Good Cop points.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> uses the Honor Meter, which starts in the middle and gets filled to either side, depending on the deeds you do. Disposing of rustlers (be it by leaving them tied up for the sheriff or shooting them dead) and helping people out (in and out of missions) raises your Honor, while committing crimes decreases it.
<ul><li> The rewards for being fully good or evil are a bit skewed: Bad Marston gets the fastest horse in the game (pointless, since the 2nd fastest can be gotten relatively early in the game regardless of karma and the DLC demon horses come with Status Buffs) and attacked by posses on occasion, while good Marston becomes <em>fucking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a></em> and gets showered with gifts by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non Player Characters</a>.
</li><li> For extra fun, John's interactions with NPCs change depending on his Honor; being Good means he'll greet people politely when they pass on the street, while being Evil means he'll insult and threaten them.
<ul><li> The game also has a Fame meter which goes alongside the Honor meter.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Honor Meter of <em>RDR1</em> returns in the prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em>. High Honor brings rewards like increased payments for hunting, cleaner killcams, and discounts at merchants. Low Honor players get more money from robberies and gorier killcams, though even at maximum honor they're quite bloody. And not only that, but the honor system actually plays a role in the story beyond being a gameplay mechanic, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with several late-game cutscenes and conversations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlignmentBasedEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlignmentBasedEndings">including both endings, having low and high honor variants</a>. Depending on which path you take for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a> fight with the traitorous Micah Bell toward the end of Chapter 6 (either "Go with John Marston" or "Go for the loot"), Micah will kill the low-honor Arthur, while at high honor he simply leaves the wounded Arthur to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone">die alone</a> from tuberculosis while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CueTheSun">watching the sunrise</a>, at peace with himself for having helped John and his family secure a better future.</span>

Filling either one (or both!) too much brings about various negative effects. Some of those, however, can be mitigated with upgrades or careful play.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em> has a kind of karma meter for each stage based on your species' behavior. Typically, the green choices are "friendly/social", the blue choices are "flexible/mixed", and the red choices are pretty much "aggressive/violent", depending on how the player decides to reach the goals for stage completion.
<ul><li> In cell stage, you start out as either an herbivore (green) or carnivore (red). Later, by using both herbivore and carnivore mouths or an omnivore mouth, you can become an omnivore (blue) creature, or you can switch to the other extreme.
</li><li> In creature stage, the choices are social (green), adaptable (blue), or predator (red).
</li><li> In tribal stage, the choices are friendly (green), industrious (blue), or aggressive (red).
</li><li> In civilization stage, you start out defaulting to whichever color you had at the end of tribal stage, and can shift up or down to the other ones from there — an aggressive civilization can become religious simply by capturing a religious city and using religious vehicles to convert other cities. The choices here are religious (green), economic (blue), and military (red).
</li><li> Upon arriving in space stage, a species "archetype" is chosen for the species based on the previously-made choices, resulting in a different special power for each choice, for example, a pure or majority "blue" run would give you the Trader Archetype, and the ability to instantly make alien planets with which you have a trade route available for purchase, while two greens, a blue, and a red would give you the Ecologist Archetype, and the power to automatically snag samples of each kind of life-form found on a planet, the Zealot archetype grants you Fanatical Frenzy, which lets you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassHypnosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassHypnosis">conquer all cities on a planet instantly</a>; the Scientist archetype grants you the Gravitation Wave, which wipes out all civilization on a planet while keeping the planet itself intact, just to name a few examples. Your archetype can actually be completely changed by taking a special mission from another space faring civilization of that archetype if they have a 4-5 star rating. Though it requires a hefty amount of Sporebucks to do so and sometimes the objectives are lengthy, alternatively, unlocking all of the equipment of that archetype as a captain in the <em>Galactic Adventures</em> expansion allows you the ability to change into that archetype. Interestingly, the Knight archetype by completing two stages in red, one stage blue and one stage as green never occurs as a civilization and thus you can never change to it (save-file civilizations of Knights are treated as Warriors instead and there is no Knight equipment in <em>Galactic Adventures</em>). The final archetype is Wanderer and is there if you started the Space stage on a new file, skipping everything else.

The video game adaptation, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade — Redemption</em> uses the Humanity score more as a standard Karma meter: your score at the end determines whether you join with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> as his minion, kill him and take his place, or kill him and are reunited with your lover.

What happens if it hits zero depends on the character type; for a human, zero Morality is absolute, cold-blooded sociopathy, usually accompanied by insanity (since the guilt from losing Morality often causes the character to develop Derangements). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em>, the moral standard is still Humanity, and zero renders them unthinking monsters, as before.

That being said, every character has three meters for the Renown they collect, representing Glory (which is gained for accomplishing great deeds, particularly in battle), Honor (for fulfilling your duties and being courteous) and Wisdom (mostly for interacting with the spirit world). Rank advancement is handled entirely by Renown requirements, creating a mostly meritocratic society. Other were-creatures usually have similar traits, reflecting the preferred virtues of their cultures.
</li><li> Notably, Honor is very much not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">Good Is Dumb</a> - it only refers to honorable behaviour <em>within your society</em>. Challenging a great monstrosity to single combat rather than having your pack's Ragabash slit its throat while it sleeps is considered glorious, but not particularly honorable, as the enemy does not deserve anything but death.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> has Wisdom, which reflects how prudently you use your magic. Using magic to harm a sentient being is actually a pretty bad sin, as are the standard murder, mind control, and soul theft. Oddly enough, you can actually get slightly dinged for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">Mundane Utility</a>, because bending the very power of the cosmos in order to boil an egg is selfish and just plain lazy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a></em> has Humanity, like with vampires, with the inversion that Prometheans are trying to <em>ape</em> humanity, which they have relatively little experience with, rather than trying to cling to old memories of morality.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> has Clarity, which officially isn't so much a Karma Meter as it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter">Sanity Meter</a>, representing how easily you can keep yourself centered and distinguish fantasy from reality after getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">the mother of all mind rapes</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>. Murder and theft are still sins, but so are things such as taking psychotropic drugs, spending too much time away from humanity, and experiencing unexpected life changes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HunterTheVigil">Hunter: The Vigil</a></em> has Morality, the standard mortal measure. However, hunters can alter their moral thresholds to be more in line with the Vigil. They'll just have to take a penalty to social actions that mounts the more their moral code skews away from the norm.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters">Geist: The Sin-Eaters</a></em> uses Synergy, a measure of how well the Sin-Eater and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">geist</a> get along. Acts such as murder to restore health and consuming ghosts for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Plasm</a> ding the meter, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">dying and coming back more than once</a>. If you reach 0, you become a soulless creature cowering in fear at the sights of the Underworld.
<ul><li> Sin-Eaters have it even worse than most. If they die, they come back to life, but lose one point of Synergy, and two points of <em>maximum</em> Synergy. If their maximum Synergy is reduced to 0 by this, they're either subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a>, or go through the above, but worse; a geist who chooses to linger in its host body after the Sin-Eater's soul has been shredded is sooner or later invariably driven homicidally insane by the tortured remnants of its former host's soul — and given that they're already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personifications</a> of Death fused with human ghosts, this is a very, <em>very</em> bad thing. For some reason, both these and the more moderate version above are referred to as "The Wretched."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheCurse">Mummy: The Curse</a></em> has Memory, a measure of how much of their self-identity and past existence a mummy recalls. In addition to the standard mortal sins, a mummy must avoid destroying evidence of their mortal life and of the culture they came from, and must protect their tomb and the relics they're charged with guarding. Compared to other supernaturals, a mummy's Memory starts much lower, reflecting their limited self-knowledge (the standard rating is 7; starting Memory is 3). They can bounce back after hitting Memory 0 by dying and coming back again, which resets them to Memory 1.
</li><li> "Minor" supernaturals, like Psychics, Thaumaturges, and Immortals, also use Morality. This is not good for Blood Bathers, one of the forms of Immortal — their method of immortality, at best, with a particularly forgiving and not especially vile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodBath">Blood Bathing</a> ritual, involves being permanently camped at the low end of the Morality Meter, just waiting for a <em>really</em> atrocious act to send them into sociopathic depravity. More commonly, it sends them unavoidably screaming off the Evil end of the Karma Meter, sooner or later. Unsurprisingly, the game recommends that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> Blood Bathers be constructed so they're at the former end.
</li><li> Fan-made game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em> has Obligation, representing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Genius's</a> personal connection to "normal" humanity. Treating humans as disposable or replaceable (Mengele gets quoted) damages it; at the highest levels, <em>surgery</em> calls for a check, and some manner of socialization is needed to keep it high, but you're also innately trustworthy. Hit zero and you start cackling, and decide to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">stop at absolutely nothing to see your experiments through</a>, no matter how many scientific atrocities are needed.
</li><li> For completion's sake, it's worth mentioning <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent">Demon: The Descent</a></em>, which has a truly bizarre variation on the nWoD Karma Meter — instead of representing karma, sanity, or any more standard facet to be measured, it covers the demon's ability to hide from the God-Machine and convincingly appear to be an ordinary mortal. As such, hitting zero with it <em>doesn't</em> mean the character is automatically forfeit, but it is extremely dangerous, and a demon that can't establish a new cover quickly probably won't survive. It's also mechanically based on Integrity, as introduced in <em>The God-Machine Chronicle</em>, rather than Morality, leading to it functioning substantially differently in important ways.
</li><li> Interestingly, of the above, only werewolves, demons and sin-eaters have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, with all of their karma meters being notably different in terms of sins to the standard set by Morality. All other supernaturals have basically a few added sins (and slightly different rationalizations as to why various acts are immoral) to humans, and that's it.
</li><li> The upcoming <em>Beast: The Primordial</em> has Satiety, a measure of how well the Beast satisfies their Horror's Hunger through causing the appropriate sort of fear and suffering. Acts that can feed Hunger are usually morally-grey at best, but letting it fall too low usually causes more harm in the long run, as the Horror roams in search of food — at 0, the Beast becomes a nearly-uncontrolled monster obsessed with feeding its hunger at any cost and which can only be truly satisfied (and pulled back out of this state) with fairly major acts of cruelty. It also tends to fluctuate more than most, as in addition to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a>, it's <em>also</em> their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManaMeter">Mana Meter</a>.
<ul><li> Notably, high Satiety can be just as dangerous as low. When a Beast's Satiety maxes out at 10, his Hunger falls into a glutted sleep, and the Beast is no more than a mortal until it has digested some of its feast.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrincessTheHopeful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrincessTheHopeful">Princess: The Hopeful</a></em> has Belief, which roughly represents a Princess's optimism, hope that the world will get better, and commitment to her principles. At high Belief a Princess's magic becomes more powerful, she has an easier time transforming, and she is better able to bear the burden of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllergicToEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllergicToEvil">Sensitivity</a>. A princess who hits Belief 0 loses her magic, suffers amnesia regarding everything to do with having been a Princess, and becomes little more than an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Empty Shell</a>, going through the motions of her mundane life if prompted and hemorrhaging Willpower. If she recovers a dot of Belief (which will almost always require intervention from her friends) before running out of Willpower, then she dies the next time she sleeps and her soul escapes into the Light. If not, she falls into a coma from which she can only escape by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a> (which frees her soul), or by calling the Darkness into herself and becoming one of the Dethroned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SirenTheDrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SirenTheDrowning">Siren: The Drowning</a></em> has Stability, which differs from most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> karma gages in that it's double-sided: A siren has a single dot of Foundation (representing their personal will to survive), 1-5 dots of Civilization Stability stretching upwards from the Foundation (representing their connection to humanity and society), and 1-5 dots of Nature Stability stretching <em>downwards</em> from the Foundation (representing their connection to the natural world.) If the Siren's Civilization hits zero, they are locked into their Diluvian form, while if their Nature hits zero, they are locked into their human form. If both hit zero, the Siren regains access to both forms, but it becomes possible for them to lose their Foundation dot (as long as you have at least one dot in either Stability, acts that would cause Foundation Dissonance cause you to lose Stability from the higher of the two meters). And if they lose <em>that</em> dot, they degenerate into a mindless Banshee, their sole remaining desire to find humans and drain them of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Pneuma</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LeviathanTheTempest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LeviathanTheTempest">Leviathan: The Tempest</a></em> has Tranquility, which represents the character's ability to keep his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">beastial self</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">divine self</a> in check. The Leviathan has a Tranquility track of twelve boxes. The divine nature starts in the top box (which it will always occupy barring the intervention of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidWithTheLeash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidWithTheLeash">Atoll</a>) and expanding downwards from there whenever the Leviathan treats others as pawns, deliberately uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">the Wake</a> on others, goes too long without human contact, or is criticized by an Atoll. The bestial nature, on the other hand, starts in the bottom box (which, again, it cannot be removed from without an Atoll), and expands upwards whenever the Leviathan destroys things, attacks others without a good reason, goes too long without human contact, or is criticized by an Atoll. Whatever spaces are left in the middle are occupied by the Leviathan's human mind. When Tranquility hits zero, the Leviathan's divine and bestial selves come into direct conflict and battle for control. If the bestial self wins, the Leviathan becomes a Typhon, a feral beast dominated only by its instincts. If the divine self wins, the Leviathan becomes an Ophion, a mad demigod seeking to expand its power and influence by dominating and manipulating mortal proxies.
<ul><li> One other quirk of Tranquility is that, unlike almost all other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeters">Karma Meters</a>, the player does <em>not</em> have the ability to spend Experience to buy back lost Tranquility. Each School offers a specific achievement that will give you a chance to regain Tranquility, and it can be restored by positive reinforcement from an Atoll, but you cannot buy it back.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a> crossover game <em>Midnight Circus</em> features an unusual variation on this in the form of Snares and Barbs, representing the level of influence the eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear">Circus</a> has over your soul, most of which can only be removed by powerful magic. Buying a round of drinks is usually only enough to get you a single Snare, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">bargaining for new powers</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Cavendish</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepulsiveRingmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepulsiveRingmaster">the Ringmaster</a> will get you five Snares. Five Snares equal a single Barb; the more Barbs you have, the more control the Circus has over you, until at five Barbs, you become a NPC and join the ranks of the Circus. For good measure, some exhibits actually <em>force</em> Snares on you just for staying around too long: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakShow">Freak City</a> has players developing a Snare for every minute they stay, and for every Barb they acquire, they also lose a dot in Social or Mental Attributes and gain a deformity; at five Barbs, they become one of the freaks.

<ul><li> In 1st Edition the Dungeon Master was advised to keep a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a> chart for each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PC</a> showing how Good/Evil and Lawful/Chaotic they were. Each time a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PC</a> committed a Good/Evil and/or Lawful/Chaotic act, they would be moved appropriately within the chart. If a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PC</a> ever changed their alignment due to such drift, they would lose a level of experience. Certain character classes (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> paladins) could lose their powers if they changed alignment. Magic items, spells and creatures of a specific alignment would react negatively to characters of an opposite alignment (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>).
</li><li> 2nd Edition loosened these restrictions somewhat. Instead of losing a level of experience, it just took twice as many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> to reach the next level. Also, the penalty was no longer automatic: it only occurred if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonMaster">Dungeon Master</a> didn't agree with the change and the change was completely voluntary.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> campaign setting has a variation in the form of Dark Powers Checks: If you perform an evil deed that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> feels deserving, he rolls a percentage die to judge if it attracts attention from the Dark Powers, and, should the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> dislike you, they start turning you into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">monster</a>. Should you perform a deed of <em>exceptional</em> evil, you may eventually find yourself a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">darklord</a> of your own domain-too bad in both cases it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">true curse</a>. Also rather unforgiving-although it has reservations for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">Pay Evil unto Evil</a>, there are just some deeds the baddies don't deserve.
</li><li> 3rd Edition book <em>Unearthed Arcana</em> was full of rules variants, including alternate Karma Meters. Honor was one, where you could cultivate a good score by acting honorably regardless of your personal inclinations. Reputation was another, though less reliant on morality and more on the scale and perception of your deeds.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a>'s other main game line <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> has a variant of this: acting against your Virtues costs willpower and gives you Limit which when full makes you go crazy for a little while. However as the virtues <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">don't really correspond to modern morality</a>, and resisting magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a> also gives you limit, it almost doesn't count as this trope.
</li><li> The old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MarvelSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MarvelSuperHeroes">Marvel Super Heroes</a></em> RPG has Karma points. The main problem with this is that it rewards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> almost obsessively, and saving a life is worth only 20 Karma, while knocking down a given area of city is worth -5. So if you save a life by knocking down four squares of city, you come out even. It essentially made a Punisher character unplayable, because you lost <em>all</em> your Karma if you killed, <em>even to save lives</em>. You also take a Karma ding for mind control, owning a gun, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">jaywalking</a>...
<ul><li> It was worse. There were karma penalties for missing press conferences, and letting crime go unpunished. You were better off making that date at the Town Square. Oh, and villains naturally had their own Karma system.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> uses a Karma Meter as its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> — performing good acts of significance earns you (Good) Karma, which is used to advance your character. You explicitly <em>can't</em> get Karma for evil acts, no matter how grand or significant, and evil characters instead need to "buy" Karma with cash, representing philanthropy and good works to "buy off" their evil actions.
<ul><li> Revised in recent editions. Karma isn't awarded for being a good character, but a good player. That is, a gamemaster is instructed to award karma for good roleplaying, being funny, driving the plot along. So if someone makes the game fun, they get rewarded for it. There is a notoriety attribute, which you increase by failing or being a dick. It contributes to intimidate and penalizes negotiation.
<ul><li> And partially reintroduced with Fifth Edition — although you get Karma for any mission, you get <em>more</em> for morally good missions. The tradeoff is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPaysBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPaysBetter">Evil Pays Better</a>.

Once you have a number of Corruption points equal to your <em>Spirit</em> die type, you're in danger of losing your character to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>.

There were five major Virtues and Vices to track behavior against, and acting in accord with Virtues generated new Soul Points for you while indulging Vices caused decay.

However, Virtues and Vices aren't mutually exclusive, they're just how often you've acted in accord with one or the other, and so your Soul Point total is an imperfect reflection of morality, especially since you can steal Soul Points from others. The ultimate result is a setting where Power versus Karma is on a bell curve, where the least and most powerful people are the most horrible ones. Truly good people rarely graduate out of the middle ranks of power because they're just not ruthless enough to deal with the big players.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld">Bleak World</a></em> has one for each race, although some function more as a hunger or balance meter.
