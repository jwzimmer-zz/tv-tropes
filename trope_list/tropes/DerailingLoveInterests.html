</p><p>Let's visit our old friends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob">Alice and Bob</a>. Alice loved Bob once, but Bob didn't or couldn't return her love. So she left him and took up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Charlie</a>. In Charlie, she gets a boyfriend who is sweet, sensitive, responsible, and truly loves her: everything she ever wanted from her relationship with Bob and then some. She's in love and everything is perfect. Meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedEpiphany">Bob has realized what he had when Alice loved him</a>. He's ready to fight to win her back before she marries Charlie and all hope is lost.
</p><p>There's only one problem: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWouldAnyoneTakeHimBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyWouldAnyoneTakeHimBack">Alice has no reason to take him back</a>. She's met her perfect match, she's in love and life is bliss. And why should she believe that Bob, after not-loving her for so long, is genuinely in love with her now? She's over Bob. He had his chance, he blew it, and now everything is about Alice and Charlie.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Fortunately for Bob, the writer (call her Dee) is in his corner. Bob's predicament leaves Dee with her own set of problems. She needs to break up the happy couple so Bob can have Alice, but unlike most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Leads</a>, Charlie has no glaring incompatibility or other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSparks">No Sparks</a>-type issue with Alice that would take him out of the story. But neither can Dee just let Alice marry Charlie and leave Bob out in the cold. That wouldn't be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">formulaic!</a> More seriously, that kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreShift">Genre Shift</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy">Romantic Comedy</a> to pure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaTropes">Drama</a> may not please the viewers, since it punishes Bob even after he'd seen the error of his ways. And while Dee might want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds">make a happy ending for all</a> or merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">Pair the Spares</a>, that means spending time developing a fourth character to be the replacement love interest of whichever man does not get Alice.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>So Dee solves the problem by diverting viewer sympathy away from Charlie. Typically this is done by turning him into an utter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a>. Alice's sweet suitor starts showing traits that were never there before. He gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyJealousGuy">jealous</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">violent</a>. He reveals (or Alice discovers) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">that he's cheating on her and has been for some time</a>. Rarely is this even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowed</a> before it all breaks loose. It's a very fast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> which serves only to cut off the audience's investment in Alice/Charlie and drive Alice into Bob's arms.
</p><p>If done too abruptly and without foreshadowing, viewers will realize that Dee has used an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> in order to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> back together. It doesn't look good for Alice, either: if Charlie's new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedFlaw">flaw</a> is small in comparison to Bob's, she seems fickle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorFlawMajorBreakup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorFlawMajorBreakup">to dump him for it</a>; if his flaw is enormous, she seems like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judge of Character</a> for not noticing it sooner.
</p><p>(Even though we have been discussing this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob">Alice, Bob, and Charlie</a>, the three players can be any combination of genders.)

<ul><li> In the shoujo manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDevilDoesExist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDevilDoesExist">The Devil Does Exist</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> Kamijou Yuucihi's character becomes derailed when he suddenly becomes a bit forceful towards Kayano. This doesn't really match his original character, and was obviously done so that Kayano's decision to go with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Takeru</a> is justified. The saddest part is that, even when he turns more aggressive, he's still a <em>much</em> nicer guy than Takeru.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> has Trunks, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a> of Bulma and Vegeta, two characters who had little interaction up to that point, claim out of nowhere that Yamcha, Bulma's boyfriend since the beginning mistreated Bulma and was seeing other women. This makes little sense as Yamcha is portrayed in the series as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> who wanted to get married and was a gynophobic character who had issues with other women. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">The Unfair Sex</a> is also heavily added to the mix as Bulma was constantly openly chasing other men throughout their entire relationship, yet Yamcha being derailed into being unfaithful is supposed to make him look bad. The Japanese voice actors <a class="urllink" href="http://www.kanzenshuu.com/translations/supplemental-daizenshuu-super-voice-talks/">even pointed out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> how little sense Yamcha's handling made, as did <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJbGKHEjEw4">fans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A popular fan justification for Yamcha's sudden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">Out-of-Character Moment</a> is Bulma made it all up.
</li><li> In the shoujo manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SteppingOnRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SteppingOnRoses">Stepping on Roses</a></em> (<em>Hadashi de Bara wo Fume</em>), Nozomu was originally a sweet gentleman who had been the merciful one that donated money to Sumi when her kid sister got really sick. However, in order to justify that Sumi should stay with Souichirou, his character becomes derailed as he suddenly becomes possessive and eventually an out-and-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">yandere</a> for her. As if to make everyone no longer have any doubt who Sumi should end up with, he eventually goes so far as to try to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rape her, only to decide to commit double suicide with her when the place gets set on fire</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KunihikoIkuhara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KunihikoIkuhara">Kunihiko Ikuhara</a> has been accused of having done this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> anime. Since he's an open <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriFan">Yuri Fan</a> and has said that he doesn't like the character of Usagi's boyfriend Mamoru, many fans have accused him of deliberately reducing Mamoru's powers and importance to the plot so Usagi would look better with other female characters. He cheerfully admitted to repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">killing off</a> Mamoru for this purpose, but of course the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">producers</a> would always mandate that Mamoru be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">brought back</a>, much to Ikuhara's irritation. Then again this <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Ikuhara</a> we're talking about, so who knows if he <em>is</em> really serious.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/XamdLostMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/XamdLostMemories">Xam'd: Lost Memories</a></em> falls into this trap a little with its treatment of Furuichi: although his bad behavior toward Haru <em>is</em> foreshadowed fairly early on in the story, and <em>does</em> follow fairly believably from what we already know about him, it's still pretty jarring to see him get stripped of virtually <em>all</em> his redeeming qualities in the last couple of scenes he's in to prove he's not good enough for her. Doubly so because Akiyuki, who is Haru's official love interest, actually <em>caused</em> — albeit unintentionally — much of Furuichi's current torments yet he never faces any punishment for doing so or even acknowledges that he might have done wrong by him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo">Oreimo</a></em>, Manami Tamura went from being a sweet-natured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a> with a slight dislike of Kirino to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an apparent diabolical mastermind who's been trying to keep Kirino and Kyousuke apart so she can have him all to herself since the age of <em>seven</em></span>.

While Lorna has never been the most stable of people, Austen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterExaggeration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterExaggeration">blew her mental issues</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">full-blown bitchy psychosis</a> to justify getting Havok together with the nurse he telepathically dated while in a coma (caused by her telepath son, Carter, who wanted a daddy and wasn't above committing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> to force Havok to be his daddy). This ended with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayFiance">Havok dumping Polaris at the altar</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipSue">Annie</a>, and Polaris <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">flipping her shit and attempting to kill them both</a> before Juggernaut knocked her out. Polaris was put into psychic therapy with Professor Xavier; Havok and Annie ran off to Paris together, seemingly supported by <em>all</em> the other X-Men. Austen wasn't at all shy about telling people that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Annie was a stand-in directly modeled off his own wife and that he envisioned himself as Havok</a>; this did nothing to help fans accept the pairing... especially since, after all this, Annie was throwing herself at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iceman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iceman">Iceman</a> <em>while still with Havok</em>! It's no wonder that Austen, upon leaving the book, put Annie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">on a bus out of town with Carter</a> to protect his much-reviled character from future reprisals. Though Austen did have her last issue feature a nebulous scene where it's implied that Carter has hooked up with Elias Bogan, a disembodied telepath who liked to trick kids into selling their parents to him to use as slaves to rape and torture for his own sick amusement...
</li><li> Exhibit B is his run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>, in which he pulled his trademark three-way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AntMan">Giant-Man,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWasp">The Wasp</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hawkeye">Hawkeye</a>. Giant-Man became a full-on misogynistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> in the vein of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> counterpart; Wasp became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a> victim (oh, yeah, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverLiveItDown/ComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverLiveItDown/ComicBooks">Infamous Hitting Incident</a> was brought back <em>yet again</em> for this just to cover all the bases, even though it had been supposedly <em>finally</em> laid to rest about three issues prior, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a> run); and Hawkeye was derailed into secretly having had a thing for Wasp and hated Giant-Man since the Eighties. All of this was promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">reversed</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianMichaelBendis">the next writer</a> on the book, who killed Hawkeye and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chickification">reverted Wasp back to her Sixties self</a> before breaking her and Giant-Man up for good (or at least until someone else comes along).
</li><li> As proof that no company is safe, Exhibit C is his short career with DC. After being handed the reins to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> book, Austen proceeded to make it clear that he hated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LoisLane">Lois Lane</a>'s guts (especially in interviews), hated the Superman marriage, and preferred <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LanaLang">Lana Lang</a> as Supes's one and only. His reasoning was that Lois was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">gold-digging bitch who only married Clark because he's Superman</a> (even though she agreed to marry Clark Kent, not Superman) and tried his best to make readers agree with him. Since his "best" involved things like derailing poor Lois into a huge shrew who didn't give a damn about her husband and having Martha "Ma" Kent expressly make the point that she would have rather had Lana as her daughter-in-law, this went over like a lead balloon and ended with Austen being fired. Readers also rejected such retcons as Lana's reasoning for naming her son with Pete "Clark" (rather than it coming from respect for an old friend, Lana had picked the name because she was still hopelessly in love), seeing them as desperate and creepy rather than sympathetic. As with almost every other relationship Austen ever wrote, later writers either ignored or outright rejected his take on things.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Something similar happened to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat">Black Cat</a> in the comics. For publicity reasons it was decided to have Spider-Man marry at the same time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/SpiderMan">the newspaper strip</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">the comic book</a>; unfortunately at the time, Peter was dating Felicia Hardy/Black Cat. The solution? Make Felicia go from morally ambiguous cat-burglar to the ally of an assassin for hire. Though the storyline was badly written and not helped by various production delays, this was no derailment. Peter and Felicia had broken up in 1984, about two years before the decision to have him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson">Mary Jane</a> marry was taken. When the Black Cat started dating Spider-Man again — in <em>Spectacular Spider-Man</em> #123 (published a mere five months before Peter proposed to Mary Jane in <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> #290), she was in cahoots with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Foreigner</a>, the assassin responsible for the murder of Ned Leeds (a.k.a. "The Hobgoblin"). It also was clear from the start that she was motivated by a desire for revenge against Peter for getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> to remove the bad-luck power she had bought from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a>. And this period of dating began with the Black Cat faking a bomb attack on her own apartment to get a pretext to invite herself in as Peter's new flatmate. Felicia is actually a victim of this repeatedly in the comics. The 1984 breakup was due to editors refusing to let Spider-Man have a longterm love interest at the time. As a result, despite showcasing that she would love Peter regardless, her attitude quickly derailed when the big moment came where he finally revealed who he really was to her. Now she refused to accept his Peter Parker identity and only loved him for being Spider-Man, repeatedly risked his identity going public over petty reasons, and constantly harping on Peter whenever he lied or kept a secret from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">despite constantly lying about her own aforementioned Kingpin deal</a>, ultimately turning into a full-blown selfish whiny brat. After Peter and Mary Jane were married, she was reintroduced and turned into a crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> who even physically threatened Mary Jane. After this period she finally went through some much-needed fixing, and for a good period of time, her character went back to the way she originally was. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a> happened, having her be arrested by the new Spider-Man and subsequently become a crime boss after getting out of prison, outright ignoring the fact that she was not wronged by Peter himself.
</li><li> This happens to a few characters during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BrandNewDay">Brand New Day</a></em> run. Thanks to having a rotation of writers, each writer seemed to have their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing">OTP</a>. Carlie Cooper, however, was the intended love interest, so that led to the derailing of several characters to make room for her. Michelle Gonzales, Pete's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> roommate, suddenly became verbally and violently abusive towards him, and Mary Jane, despite still apparently being deeply in love with him, becomes more distant and even turns into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipperOnDeck">Shipper on Deck</a> for him and Carlie. Bizarrely, even Black Cat, who was still in love with Peter even when she knew he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to Mary Jane, became an approver of the Peter/Carlie relationship, <em>despite never having met her</em>. However, once Dan Slott took over full time as writer, it took him less than a year to sink the Peter/Carlie relationship and brought Peter and Mary Jane much closer together as friends again.
</li><li> Happened during the '90s Howard Mackie/John Byrne relaunch, where Mary Jane became more bitter and angry at Peter for being Spider-Man, to the point where she left him for a long period of time. Then she was blown up in a plane (she got better). All of this was done to get Peter single again, so he could start dating other characters, most notably Jill Stacy (Gwen Stacy's cousin.)
</li><li> The aftermath of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> run? MJ and Carlie pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">Screw This, I'm Outta Here!</a> and leaving New York because they're fed up of being potential victims to anybody who has a grudge with Spider-Man (and MJ starts to date a firefighter, who is pretty much Peter without the powers, though she does see Peter yet again in the "Who Am I" mini-series which her influence restores an amnesia-ridden Peter's memories and he saves her life), and Black Cat pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">Woman Scorned</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and wanting to destroy Spider-Man (and become the next Kingpin) because Otto destroyed her life and now she is not going to take Peter's apology unless she pries it from his dead body (and considering one of the first things she does is <em>send Electro to kill Spider-Man</em>, she is either teetering close to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> or has passed it but it's imperceptible). All to promote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Silk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Silk">Silk</a> as Spider-Man's new love interest.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrangersInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrangersInParadise">Strangers in Paradise</a></em>: It was certainly <em>very convenient</em> that Francine's husband turned out to be having an affair near the end of the series, thus freeing her up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">finally</a> get together with Katchoo.
</li><li> Devin Grayson was a comic book writer who got to be in charge of the late '90s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Titans</a> run. So far, so good. There's a problem, though... her OTP was Barbara/Dick, but some writers preferred him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire">Koriand'r</a>. What was Devin's solution? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DieForOurShip/ComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DieForOurShip/ComicBooks">Bash the shit out of Kory by making her an absolute bitch to Dick, so he can run back into Babs's arms.</a> Dick and Kory had been long broken up since the end of Wolfman's run, but Grayson's character derailment simply made things worse, especially since the two agreed that they could simply be very good friends at the end of <em>The Technis Imperative</em> (a mini-series co-plotted by Grayson and Phil Jimenez that led to her run).
<ul><li> Further complicated by the fact that when Grayson was writing Nightwing's series, she'd clearly intended for him to propose to Barbara when she wrapped up her run. However, at the same time in Judd Winick's <em>Outsiders</em>, he portrayed Dick as having had a one-night stand with Kory to rekindle their relationship. The lack of communication between editorial departments further agitated fans of both pairing options and had the result of turning Dick Grayson into a two-timer (which the character's reputation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">couldn't quite recover from for a while</a>). Other writers like Chuck Dixon had also previously attempted to downplay Dick's past relationship with Kory as simply an ill-advised fling.
</li><li> A later Nightwing annual by Marc Andreyko further made the love triangle look worse when it was retconned in that Dick had slept with Barbara <em>the night before</em> he was due to marry Kory. It was also revealed that in an earlier point of their relationship, Babs went to deliver him flowers but instead bumped into Kory (who he'd just had sex with as his "first time"). These revelations were meant to explain why the engagement plot point became nullified in the "One Year Later" timeskip. Instead, it just complicated the issue and only gave fans further impression that Dick was an unreliable and indecisive cheater.
</li><li> What many writers don't seem to realize is that prior to the '90s, Dick and Barbara had never been a couple. This was mainly due to the fact that when he was Robin, Dick was still a teenager and Barbara was portrayed as in her mid-20's at least (she'd been in the US Congress). Dick had been pretty much eased out of the main Batman titles and eventually was with the Titans full time. Becoming Nightwing was done so he'd no longer be under the control of the Batman editors.
</li></ul></li><li> Some writers at DC seem to <strong>adore</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, as evidenced by the fact that many different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld">Elseworlds</a> either derail Lois Lane to get rid of the marriage or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheHypotenuse">kill her off entirely</a>. A stand-out example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAActOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAActOfGod">JLA: Act of God</a></em>, where a mysterious event de-powers every non-technological superbeing on the planet and made all magically powered heroes disappear, after which Lois breaks up with Clark <em>because</em> he lost his powers. Granted, the fact that Clark is busy being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">Angsty McWhineNCry</a> about the whole thing really didn't help matters, but still. And of course, Wonder Woman, despite being, you know, <em>magically powered</em>, is still around for Clark to lean on. And now, thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52">New 52</a> reboot, Clark and Lois have <em>never</em> been married, thus allowing DC to <em>finally</em> hook Superman and Wonder Woman together. Of course, this is lampshaded in the final issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueInternational" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JusticeLeagueInternational">Justice League International</a></em> when a time-travelling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> attempts to warn what's left of the team of something in the future, only to be interrupted by the two's first kiss and gawking in utter shock. Poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">Billy Batson</a> also gets this treatment in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanDistantFires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanDistantFires">Superman Distant Fires</a></em>, where he goes from a boy scout on par with Superman to a megalomaniac who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kills Diana when she refuses to get back together with him</span> and wants to take over the world.
</li><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingSlap">bitchslap</a> that sent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Sally Acorn</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkSue">Jerk Sue</a> territory has shades of this; after being a romantically entangled for many years, a supposed mandate came down ordering Sonic to not be in a permanent relationship, and the next thing readers knew, Sally was bitching out Sonic for not ditching his duties to be her consort, which led to him getting into a torrid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> with Mina Mongoose and Fiona Fox. However, after a change of writers, the love triangle was dissolved and Sally was made Sonic's one-and-only canonical love interest (at least, until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> happened).
</li><li> Similar to Chuck Austin, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> went this way with his <em>X-Men</em> run. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoeQuesada">Joe Quesada</a> wanted to break up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a>, so he told Grant to kill her off. Perfectly normal in a superhero comic, but instead of just letting her die in a good, heroic way or even stuffing her in a fridge as most writers do, he decided the best way was to derail Jean, Scott, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> in order to make a "love triangle" before killing off Jean so Scott can get together with Emma. To do so, he had Cyke, currently in a dark place following his merger with Apocalypse, seek therapy to deal with his issues, which Emma provides with her previously-never-mentioned Ph.D. in psychology. Then, she has psychic mind-sex with him to let him live out his deepest sexual fantasies that Jean would never do so while projecting the image of Jean. Jean at first is rightfully pissed at the two, especially Emma, but she receives no punishment since she 'did it out of love' for Scott, despite the fact the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">two had never previously had much interaction beyond the psychic sex</a>, and <em>Jean</em> is called out for having no sympathy for her. So, Jean forgives them all, only to be killed by Magneto despite being the Phoenix (and as such, immortal) at the time with Jean then pushing Scott beyond the grave to move on. So in short, who was supposed to be 'in the right' was emotionally manipulating a man and is rewarded with becoming the second in command, the <em>real</em> victim of the situation is made out to be a boring and dull prude, and the man in the middle is essentially mind raped when he needed therapy (which he never got, possibly explaining his own latent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a>) and ends up looking like a tool and a douche.
</li><li> In the 2017 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em> series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerPack">Julie Power</a> suddenly became pushy and unreasonable, demanding that Karolina leave the Runaways and move to New York with her, despite their relationship previously being portrayed as healthy and mutually supportive. A lot of fans suspect that this sudden change came about so that Rainbow Rowell could break up Julie and Karolina and have Karolina hook up with Nico instead.
</li><li> In his run on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoomPatrol">Doom Patrol</a></em>, Keith Giffen singlehandedly dismantled not one but two married couples that went back decades into a handful of divorcees. The minor example would be Mal Duncan and Karen Beecher (originally of the Titans), who after decades of having been married in comics were revealed to be suddenly divorced, but that doesn't even remotely compare to the <em>nuclear bomb</em> he dropped on Steve Dayton and Rita Farr, retconning Steve to have always been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert">Covert Pervert</a> abusing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">Power Perversion Potential</a> on her and having her put him in traction for it.

Johann is introduced defending June from humiliation, and is a dentist, enabling him to clean up her crooked, ugly teeth. He's also a former Marine, a Harvard graduate, a great guitar player, a male model, a pilot, and other things that make him absurdly perfect, and much better than loser protagonist Nate. But when June eventually becomes beautiful and starts going out with him, he turns out to be more or less a self-involved jerk. However, the extent of his jerktitude is a couple of selfish comments that offend Nate and June.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanOnTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanOnTop">Woman On Top</a></em> falls on the "informed flaw" side of things.

When Edward leaves in <em>New Moon</em>, Bella gets close to Jacob, who falls in love with her. When Edward comes back, in order to justify Bella staying with him rather than Jacob, the author has to make Jacob do some kind of drastic, out-of-character things, like forcing Bella to kiss him and threatening suicide to manipulate her. Then again, Bella already chose Edward as soon as he came back before Jacob started to behave badly, so it's more of a "justifying her decision not to change her mind and go with the guy who treats her like an equal and actually seems to have any feelings for her besides claiming that he loves her" than a "justifying her decision to go back."
<ul><li> Of course, given how Edward behaves in the relationship, one could just as easily assume that Meyer was trying to make Jacob <em>better</em> as love interest material, especially since Bella only realizes she loves him <em>after</em> the forced kiss and all.
<ul><li> This has been confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Stephenie Meyer</a> - the changes in Jacob's characterization was meant to make him a serious contender for Bella.

Then in the span of one chapter, he is that and more, all to push Alanna into the arms of the lovable rogue George and later Liam. Pierce had originally intended Jon and Alanna to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>, but it was while writing the third book that she came to believe they didn't work together — and if Jon does come across as cruder, some of the seeds for his behavior <em>were</em> glimpsed in the previous book, it was just played out in a more romantic light. Because Jonathan believed they were "fated" to be together, he took her assent to things as all but a given, which was exactly what infuriated her later on when the things in question were marriage and family instead of sex.

He stays in the story almost completely by one virtue: the fact that he's taking advantage of Zoey's low self-control over her new bloodlust to essentially roofie-rape her every time she sees him by cutting himself and triggering her compulsion to drink: an action that's both intensely arousing, energizing, and creates a mystical bond between them against her control. Then, of course, she realizes he's her soul-mate (one of them anyway) after he almost gets himself killed trying to win her back again, and all that is swept under the rug.

Audrey, who, in Season 5, is portrayed as the first girl to be Pacey's equal, suddenly turns from a lovable party girl into a screwed-up alcoholic who ends up in rehab the following season.

Toward the end of the show's first and only season, Cindy finally starts dating Sam, and they almost immediately learn that they have no common interests and don't have any fun together. The previously sweet-natured Cindy is also revealed to be (mildly) bitchy and manipulative, as well as a bit vapid and dull.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> After Chandler moves in with Monica, Joey's new roommate is a woman; he's attracted to her and they eventually get together. Then, she inexplicably turns out to be unable to stand Chandler and Monica, which leads to Joey breaking things off and the woman moving out.
</li><li> Paolo, Rachel's boyfriend in Season 1, is introduced as a dumb but harmless guy who enjoys being with Rachel... until he randomly becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> who tries to cheat on her. This was to make way for the Ross/Rachel relationship.
</li><li> Repeated <em>nine seasons later</em> with Charlie, Ross's girlfriend. She seems pleasant, intellectual, and well-matched with him. Out of the blue, she cheats on Ross with her ex-boyfriend right in front of him. And yep, this was to accommodate <em>another</em> Ross/Rachel hook up for the end of the series.
</li><li> Kathy, Joey and then Chandler's girlfriend in Season 4, is a very strange case. Although she does kiss Chandler while still with Joey, it was portrayed sympathetically as they'd genuinely fallen in love, while she and Joey are very casual. She eventually breaks up with Joey on good terms and enters into a proper relationship with Chandler, until eventually <em>Chandler himself</em> is the one who gets derailed. He sees her acting out a simulated sex scene with another guy in a play, and immediately assumes she much be having an affair with him. She denies this, but Chandler accuses her in such an immature and harsh way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">she DOES end up having an affair with the guy.</a> This a major wake-up call for Chandler and a turning point for his character as far as relationships were concerned, as he is notably a lot more mature with his next girlfriend (Monica) and they eventually end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with Gary, Phoebe's cop boyfriend who in season 5 was built up over several episodes as a nice, sweet person who Phoebe had genuinely fallen for. He rushed her into moving in with her, and she accepted even though she clearly wasn't ready. Instead of having them have a conversation about this and legitimately breaking up, their last scene together is them waking up together in their shared apartment and he shoots a crow through the window, completely out of the blue, for making too much noise.
</li><li> Barry, Rachel's fiancé from before the series. Initially, he was a nice, but boring guy whom she left at the altar because she didn't love him. Later its revealed he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> cheated on with her best friend throughout their engagement.
</li><li> David, to some extent. During his sporadic appearances in the first nine seasons, he's shown to be a kind and compassionate person with a successful career and genuine affection for Phoebe. In his final appearance at the end of Season Nine, he's suddenly a pathetic loser who can't even afford to buy a legitimate diamond ring for Phoebe.
</li><li> Specifically subverted when Richard returns in Season 6. When he asks Monica to leave Chandler for him, he's portrayed as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> he's always been: charming, intelligent, and, in Chandler's eyes at least, a much better prospect. The only problem is that Monica doesn't love him anymore, she loves Chandler, and there isn't anything he can do about it. This actually makes her decision to stay with Chandler much more heartwarming, as it becomes clear that she hasn't chosen him because she didn't have a better option - she's with him because he's the one she wants.
</li><li> Emily, another bump in the Ross/Rachel road. They have a season-long courtship. Everyone, except the jealous Rachel, really likes her and they plan their wedding in England. After being humiliated when Ross says Rachel's name during their wedding vows and making the somewhat reasonable demand to not see Rachel anymore if he wants the marriage to work, suddenly everyone acts as if they never liked her and she was being unfair.
</li><li> Taken to the point of self-parody with Elizabeth, a student in Ross's class that he dated for a while. She was consistently presented as smart, pleasant, and fun-loving. When he broke up with her, it had nothing to do with anything she did and was for the perfectly realistic reason that they were at very different stages in their lives and he didn't see a future together. Just as he's having second thoughts about the break-up, she sticks her head out the window to yell at him and throws a water balloon.

Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">The Bus Came Back</a> with him on board and he ends up apologizing to Rachel and is obviously still very much in love with her. However, she didn't care and got back with Finn. Rachel dates Finn on-off in the coming years, but after Finn's death, she marries a reformed and adoring Jesse in the end.
</li><li> Coach Beiste's husband is randomly revealed to be abusive. Granted, Dot-Marie Jones sold the storyline for everything she was worth and then some, but it came <em>completely</em> out of left field. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, really — people with abusive tendencies often take great pains to be nice and charming up until they can't hold it in any more or feel the other person is trapped with them.

<ul><li> Louis steadily becomes less sympathetic over the course of Season 5, as Chuck becomes a better person. This is lampshaded by Blair, as well as explained by the fact that Louis is well aware that in a competition against Chuck he'll lose no matter how nice and sweet he is, prompting him to become more underhanded in his desperation to keep Blair.

</li><li> A very strange and brief derailment of Jenny occurs in Season 2 when she seems to be on the verge of getting together with Nate. Nate writes a letter to Jenny telling her his feelings but Vanessa steals it before Jenny can read it. Jenny, having worked out the general idea of what Vanessa's up to if not the specifics, is persuaded to get her own back and humiliates Vanessa by tricking her into going to a ball in a see-through dress. Despite knowing full well what Vanessa did, Nate abruptly dismisses Jenny, telling her she's not the girl he thought she was, and...gets together with Vanessa instead. When Jenny immediately defends Vanessa to the mean girls, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">hard to tell</a> what Nate's problem is.

It came completely out of left field and was in opposition to all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> that Jake himself had gone through over the course of the show. It's especially egregious considering that the show did a special in Season Three involving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> with him, Miley/Hannah, and another love interest named Jesse, where fan vote decided who Miley would choose. The fans voted for Jake, and Miley rejected Jesse after realizing it was Jake she loved. The episode right after Jake and Miley broke up, they reintroduced Jesse as Miley's final love interest. This implies that the writers were always planning on breaking up Jake and Miley (which was the longest-running couple on the show, mind you) in favor of Jesse and were planning on using the special as an excuse to do it, only to scramble for another reason after Jake proved to be far more popular than they thought.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeAndAway">Home and Away</a></em>:
<ul><li> At first, Sam Tolhurst comes across as a sympathetic character, with a tragic backstory, (on the run from accomplices of her drug dealer husband) and is portrayed as a good match for Jack. Unfortunately, when they get engaged, and especially after getting married, she becomes a possessive controlling bitch, especially towards Jack's ex-wife Martha. At first, this is justified (specifically when she walks in on Martha wearing her wedding dress), but the writers derail her during her exit storyline. She murders a criminal who had been blackmailing her to force her to hide him, after which we learn that she had lied about her backstory — she was the ringleader in her husband's drug operation and was on the run because she'd allowed him to take the fall. After she's exposed, she kills herself and almost succeeds in framing Jack and Martha. The worst part is that the writers left several details out of this retcon, (the fact that she'd tolerated Shane's drug dealing up until she'd witnessed him killing someone in cold blood, and the fact that he'd been doing it to raise money for their terminally ill daughter). While it would have been entirely plausible by this point to handwave these as Sam's lies to Jack, they are unmentioned in the letter which reveals the truth, and Jack himself doesn't bring them up when he confronts her about it.
</li><li> Dexter Walker's girlfriend Steph Green started out as a caring and likable nurse, who supported him when he found out his brother-in-law was dying, brought out his relaxed side and even had the maturity to take a step back when he began to push too hard to make his family accept their relationship and tell him he needed a friend rather than a girlfriend. Then someone seemed to realise she was coming across as a better match than his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing">One True Pairing</a> with April Scott, so she abruptly became aggressive and controlling, pressuring him into having sex with her at work, then turned out to be neglecting her patients and making up results instead of doing the proper tests. She was promptly fired and reported Dexter's indiscretions with her as a parting shot.

</li><li> In the same episode that it was "revealed" Nick was overly sensitive, it was "revealed" that Victoria was a total slob at home, something that has never been hinted in her previous appearances and given her occupation as a highly-skilled pastry chef, it seemed rather unlikely. Thankfully, it was averted in the episode that she and Ted broke up where her being a slob wasn't what caused them to break up and Lily acknowledged that Victoria had valid reasons for breaking up with Ted because of Robin.

They spent 60% of the episode being sickeningly sweet to each other. All of Sam's attention was being spent on him, and it was causing problems for her friendships with Carly and Freddie. Also impacting on their webshow. Instead of Sam coming to realize that she can't spend all her time with him, or have Jonah realize the same and back off slightly, he suddenly tries to cheat on Sam with Carly, making all the potential issues moot when they wedgie-bounce the sucker for trying to cheat. Which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">actually made sense</a> after "iKiss" with a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">WMG</a>. In "iKiss", which happened after she dated Jonah, Sam says that she's never kissed anyone, meaning that Sam must have never kissed Jonah.

Adding insult to injury, the fact that her next boyfriend was killed off in two episodes indicates that this was done for no other reason than to make her have the same tragic, screwed-up love life that nearly everyone else does.
</li><li> This was forced on Will Griggs on <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Neighbours">Neighbours</a></em>, not because he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a>, but because the actor had left the show early and they chose to bring in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSubstitute">Suspiciously Similar Substitute</a>. At the time he was written out, Carmella was furious with Will for lying to her and hiding his real identity as Sebastian Barnes one of the richest men in the country, but he was still trying to get her to forgive him. Then suddenly he was gone, and his adoptive brother Oliver arrived to reveal that Sebastian's entire personality had been faked, and was based on Oliver. This led to Carmella and Oliver getting together, and apparently rendered insignificant Will's substantial number of good deeds, such as standing up to Paul's attempts at blackmail (his 2% share of Lassiters was enough to give Paul a controlling interest, and Paul used that to get Will's friend Ned fired); standing by Carmella when she was badly burned by her mentally unstable cousin, and thwarting an attempt by Janae's pervert of a boss to spike her orange juice. It got worse later in the year when Oliver's biological brother Declan was kidnapped, and Sebastian (offscreen) only agreed to pay the ransom if Oliver gave up his share in the Barnes hotel chain.

Others questioned how the show could arguably portray her as a villain for these actions but have Jim <em>abandon her in New York</em>, after they drove up together, just so he could drive back home and ask Pam out right away (though he acknowledges his behavior in the season four premiere).

</li><li> Before Andy, there was Gabe. His relationship with Erin was accompanied by some episodes showing them as being like a normal couple, but there were also several episodes which exaggerated him as being distant, insensitive, or just weird (particularly his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist">Nightmare Fetishist</a> level of love for horror movies) in order to show Andy as the better match for her.

Season 3 ended with Regina and Robin Hood falling in love and starting to date each other, but then suddenly Maid Marian (Robin Hood's wife who was originally dead by the present story-line of the show) is accidentally pulled out of time into present-day Storybrooke. Obviously, Robin goes back to her (since it's his long-lost wife and he made a commitment to her), making Regina furious at losing an actual love interest. One could infer that the writers wanted Regina and Robin to stay together (seeing as how quickly Robin and Regina hit back off when Marian becomes incapacitated at the beginning of Season 4), but with Marian present, they couldn't. In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Marian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">quite suddenly</a> turns out to be Regina's spiteful older sister Zelena (the real Maid Marian turned out to be dead after all)</span>, leaving <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Regina and Robin</span> free to continue their relationship without a hitch.

</li><li> Played straight in the BBC's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobinHood">Robin Hood</a></em>. Robin starts a relationship with Isabella, a seemingly intelligent, rational, and compassionate woman. However, halfway through the series, Isabella throws an inexplicable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">temper tantrum</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">goes insane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil">tries to kill him</a> after Robin tells her that his mission must come before her. This is apparently done so that the writers can kick-start Robin's love story with Kate. Oh, and if you're wondering where Maid Marian is during all of this, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was murdered by Isabella's brother last season</span>. Even more irritating was the fact that Robin cites his commitment to England and his inability to have a normal life as the reasons for breaking up with Isabella. Yet he hooks up with Kate two episodes later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">having completely forgotten his own reasons why it's not a good idea to be in a relationship</a>.
</li><li> Out of the blue, Tess on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roswell">Roswell</a></em> was revealed to have been repeatedly brainwashing their friend and conspiring with their enemies so they could break up her and Max.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SexAndTheCity">Sex and the City</a>'s</em> Alexandr is one of the best examples of this trope, going from an amazing, sweet, and sensitive guy to a jerk who ignores Carrie and proves to be completely self-absorbed before leaving for Paris.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SilentWitness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SilentWitness">Silent Witness</a></em>: Nikki and Harry's underlying mutual attraction was extremely popular with fans (and later, after Harry left, Nikki turned out to have exactly the same attraction with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Jack</a>) so, if either of them gets a love interest who isn't killed off, this is what tends to happen instead. A typical example is in the story "Safe" where Nikki begins dating a paramedic that she met at a crime scene. He initially seems to be the perfect guy, but she soon works out that he's cheating on a wife or girlfriend with her, and he turns out to have a short temper too. The last straw comes when he goes on a racist tirade against the mother of two murder victims, causing Nikki to finally wise up and dump him (much to the delight of Harry).

</li><li> Frequently used on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Operas</a>, in scenarios that play out almost exactly as in the page description.

<ul><li> A particularly good example is on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a></em>, where Jack dumped the manipulative, scheming Carly to hook up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> Julia. Fans clamored for a reunification of Jack and Carly, so within a year, Julia went from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a>, pulling increasingly horrific stunts that included attempted murder, kidnapping, and RAPE, giving Jack the perfect excuse to return to Carly — with whom he proceeded to have an on-again, off-again relationship that was just as unhealthy and destructive as their previous one (and included the sacrifice of even MORE examples of this trope for both of them) before finally marrying for good in the series finale.
</li><li> An almost identical example played out on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GuidingLight">Guiding Light</a></em> with Josh, Reva, and Annie.
</li><li> An interesting subversion on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GeneralHospital">General Hospital</a></em>, where rather than being an obstacle, the Derailing Love Interest was <em>part</em> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Fan-Preferred Couple</a> — the male half of the pairing was already in a happy relationship, and of course, it would make no sense for him to break up with a woman whom he adored. But rather than inexplicably ruining <em>her</em> character, the writers instead had him develop complete amnesia following an accident, leaving him with no memory of or regard for her, thus paving the way for his new relationship.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> has an odd case of a love interest being derailed for reasons unrelated to their being a love interest. In season 4, Dean meets Anna Milton, a fallen angel whom he quickly takes a romantic attraction to. Originally, she was going to replace Castiel (who was going to be killed by Alistair) as Dean's angel guide, however, this hit a snag when Castiel became the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>, with both fans and critics responding more positively to him than any character other than the Winchesters themselves. Thus, Castiel was spared and his role in the series expanded. This had the unfortunate side effect of making Anna redundant, however, and she was given only a few more appearances before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a> and deciding she needed to erase Dean and his brother Sam from existence. Then again, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">some people</a>, it <em>is</em> related to Anna being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">wrong love interest</a>.
</li><li> Charlie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UglyBetty">Ugly Betty</a></em> went from sweet, likable girl to jealous, two-timing harpy in no time. Then again, the show <em>is</em> partly a soap parody...

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em>: One episode involved Tori trying to help Beck get together with a girl he was interested, so he can get over his break up with Jade.

This causes Beck to leave her and get back together with Jade.

In the sequel, set ten years later, he is an alcoholic gambler who's blown his fortune, ignores his ten-year-old son, and is snippy with his wife.

</li><li> One of the biggest criticisms of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperThievesInTime">Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</a></em> is the unjustified retconning of Penelope Mouse from a smart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a> who begins dating Bentley at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sly3HonorAmongThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sly3HonorAmongThieves">Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSmartOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSmartOnes">because of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather">their similar traits</a>, into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">heartless</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> who exploited Bentley, giving him a reason to dump her.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Endtown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Endtown">Endtown</a></em>: Holly Hollister's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CharacterDerailment/Webcomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CharacterDerailment/Webcomics">Character Derailment</a> hit its most vicious point at about the same time the author introduced a new love interest, Kirbee, for which he himself has expressed great affection, holding her up as his favourite type of person (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">eternal optimist</a>). This is after spending the previous several years drawing large amounts of shipping art of Holly and her partner Wally before suddenly stopping around the time he had to go on a hiatus from the comic due to a bout of serious illness that threatened him with the loss of his legs. Notably, Holly had never previously lashed out at anyone close to her during her periods of infirmity (instead tending to flee and once attempting suicide), only doing so once plot circumstances meant it would handily push Wally away from her and into the arms of Kirbee, who had been made part of the main cast during the same rewrite that added the event that shattered Holly's remaining sanity.

<ul><li> Julie admitting in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10Omniverse">Ben 10: Omniverse</a></em> episode "Rules of Engagement" that she never liked Mr. Smoothies, only faking it in front of her ex-boyfriend Ben despite the fact that she is seen sharing smoothies with Gwen back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Alien Force</a></em> without any objections.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BobsBurgers">Bob's Burgers</a></em>:
<ul><li> When she was first introduced in "House Trap" Helen was a decent if somewhat unstable woman who had a budding mutual interest in Teddy. When she returns in "The Helent Hunt", she's impatient, unempathetic, and easily agitated with him. Considering her last appearance ended with the implication that she murdered her first husband, it's possible that her nice attitude before was just an act.
</li><li> Inverted with Gene's recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> Courtney Wheeler. She is introduced as a spoiled, self-centered, and arrogant girl who annoys the Belchers and pushes Gene into being her boyfriend. By her reappearance in Season 5, she is much nicer to everyone, including Gene, and although they compete, they end the episode in good terms. Subsequent appearances sometimes hint at a possible relationship between them as she is more often characterized as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet">Spoiled Sweet</a> girl who enjoys Gene's company. Subsequently, her father is now an antagonist due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a> tendencies.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Quagmire gets engaged to a calm and attractive maid. Throughout the episode, the relationship was loving and Quagmire even lost interest in other women. Peter and the gang's attempts to get Quagmire back to his old womanizing ways fail, up until the wedding reception, where Peter's actions with Lois remind Quagmire of what he really wants. Then his cheerful patient bride to be is revealed to be a self-destructive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> out of nowhere, therefore absolving Quagmire of getting out of the relationship. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> in this show, so the relationship was unlikely to survive the episode.
</li><li> Similarly, in another episode, Brian ends up dating an older woman - attractive, smart, a decent head on her shoulders despite her age (which isn't even really that old), and despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">entire family</a> laughing at her for it, Brian ends up proposing to her and it seems everything is going to be okay...until out of nowhere (this is where the trope comes in), she starts calling him for lunch far too early to be reasonable, complaining about her hip, and giving 'old-fashioned' names to things. This is, again, out of nowhere and doesn't match up with anything she'd done before, but as stated before, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> and the relationship would not have survived the episode no matter how you cut it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a>:</em> Season 6's "Proposition Infinity," which uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robosexual">human/robot relationships</a> as a metaphor for gay marriage, does this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Kif</a>. He's suddenly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderized</a> into such a wuss that he's afraid to watch cooking shows because they contain chopping, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsianAirhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsianAirhead">Amy</a> suddenly becomes utterly disgusted with him, when it was Kif's sweet nature that attracted her to him in the first place. All so Amy can wind up in a relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Bender</a> that doesn't last to the end of the episode, the last scene of which has her reconcile with Kif. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Apparently this was easier than just creating a one-off human love interest for Bender</a>, or using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">human/alien relationships</a> for the metaphor instead or something. It doesn't help that the Bender/Amy romance is (accidentally?) portrayed as being a pretty dysfunctional case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">All Girls Want Bad Boys</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> used this in an episode where, before they were married, Marge goes to college and leaves Homer for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Strawman Liberal</a> professor who is smart, worldly, and seemingly more attentive to her, while he actively sets out to make Homer's honest love and devotion look like pig-headed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">Stay in the Kitchen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawMisogynist">misogyny</a> (which could itself be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoking this trope</a>). Once they start dating, the professor suddenly becomes condescending, passionless, and passive-aggressively misogynist, the final straw being that he's anti-marriage. He'd been a pretty insufferable guy up to that point but became significantly worse once he'd got rid of the competition. Homer in fact lampshades it at the end; "don't worry, kids, she'd never have stayed with that professor... unless he'd been a <em>little</em> nicer to her at the beach!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show had a sort of version of this in the second season. Trent became jealous of Duncan and Gwen's friendship, which makes some sense, but also became a ridiculously-clingy stalker and, weirdest of all, out of nowhere developed a supposedly-longstanding obsessive-compulsive fixation with the number nine. Seriously. Different than many of these examples because Gwen did <em>not</em> immediately run into another man's arms, though the show keeps teasing the idea of her and Duncan getting in a love triangle with Duncan's girlfriend Courtney. Basically, the whole situation was badly-done.
</li><li> Add Courtney's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a> in <em>Total Drama Action</em> at the list, as well...
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> between Duncan/Gwen/Courtney is a fact in <em>Total Drama World Tour</em>... and eventually Duncan cheats on Courtney for Gwen (destroying their budding friendship) with no explanation or motive, with Courtney receiving further derailment. Enough for Heather to compare Courtney to crazy Izzy.
</li></ul></li><li> In Season 6 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Blaine cheats on Clover with Mandy</span> in a very out-of-character moment for him that seemed shoehorned in for the express purpose of getting <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clover</span> single again.
</li><li> Averted/subverted/played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em> after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade">the mutant revelation</a> and the series cut up most of its romantic plot threads:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Duncan</a> and Jean broke up because he acted like a jerk. However, he always was a jerk and Jean hadn't expressed a lack of interest in the relationship any more beforehand because of his jerkitude. Only now he told Jean he was willing to "overlook her problem" and she could use her powers to help him cheat on tests. He totally crossed the line when he began attacking mutants with guns and bombs!
</li><li> Scott and Taryn broke up in a slightly straighter example as while she was always nice, she apparently no longer wants anything to do with him, but then again she just found out he's a mutant who could accidentally smash <em>planets</em> with his <em>eyes</em>, and who knows what could've happened if given the chance to see beyond that.
</li><li> Kitty and Lance broke up because she just found out he was a jerk and a villain, but Lance himself had previously been both a jerk and villain only attempting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingCatwoman">to be with Kitty</a>. In some ways, their breakup made a lot of sense considering the fact that, before they broke up, he returned to 'villainy' alongside the Brotherhood and Mystique, and still had some contempt for the X-Men. And, just so he wasn't forgotten, he got an episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> later and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment. But, some would rather think he was always an ass or worse while others would rather think he was always a sweet guy with a troubled past and bad friends.
