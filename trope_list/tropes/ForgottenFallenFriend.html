An all too common way for this to happen is to have their friends and loved ones become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTarget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyTarget">Friendly Targets</a> and suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">Death by Origin Story</a> to kick start their quest.
</p><p>They will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">thrash and wail</a>, swear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">bloody vengeance</a> on their killer and go on a multi-season quest to avenge... who was it again? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAndBob">Bob? Alice?</a>
</p><p>This trope is about the tendency of a narrative to have heroes forget their fallen friends and loved ones with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpiphanyTherapy">worrying</a> ease. This is both mental and emotional; heroes will rarely reflect on these losses, or even use them in an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThisIsFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThisIsFor">And This Is for...</a>" speech, and the emotional impact of the loss is rarely ever shown afterward. (And not because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">they are bottling it up</a>.)
</p><p>This can manifest as a husband avenging his murdered wife who hooks up with the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a> he meets without the smallest bit of guilt, or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">orphaned son</a> who quickly puts his parents' smoldering remains out of mind to have fun with his new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveManBand">Five-Man Band</a>. The hero might even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">easily forgive</a> the culprit without batting an eye. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depends On The Writer</a>, especially on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long Runner</a> where there are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">loads and loads</a> of them; if the <em>writer</em> can't remember a character, there's no chance in hell that the <em>characters</em> will.

However, when the dearly departed's loss has all the emotional impact of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableWoman">Disposable Woman</a> dying, it can nudge uncomfortably outside of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a> Zone.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> played with this trope during the Conviction Arc. Guts remembered quite vividly what had happened to his comrades <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who were all killed by demons</span> during the Eclipse and especially to his lover Casca <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who survived, but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">brutalized</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation">insanity</a></span>. He used their fates as his motivation for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against Griffith, the man who betrayed them, and the Godhand. However, Guts was so embroiled in his hatred and the sadness and grief he suffered that he decided to suffer alone, often forgetting that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was not the only survivor of the Eclipse and that the only other survivor, Casca, was the one he loved the most, but he left her for two years, not sticking around to help or comfort her through the pain she had suffered (which was considerably worse than what he had been through)</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">Godo called Guts out on this</a>, and Guts realized that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> leaving Casca and forgetting about her pain</span> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure">his failure</a>.
</li><li> Zig-zagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ukita</span> gets killed on live TV, everyone on the investigation team sees it, but it is practically forgotten a few pages later, likely because Souichiro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarFu">rams an armored car into the TV Station</a> to get his hands on the Kira Tapes. However, his death is mentioned a few times in later episodes, as Aizawa feels as though he couldn't face his dead colleague if he gives up on the investigation.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em>, Ange's mother dies trying to protect her when her brother Julio outs her as a norma in public leading her to be sent to Arzenal. Later on, Julio reveals that he had their father executed offscreen for his part in protecting Ange. Neither of these two, nor even the fact he stabbed her in the back, made her life hell, and tried to have her and everyone else on Arzenal killed, come up in episode 13 when she finally turns the tables and is raring to kill him. Just the fact that he destroyed the place considered a living death trap for Norma, because somehow she liked living there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> Bancho Leomon pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> in an attempt to destroy Yggdrasil, it backfires.

You'd think that at least <em>one of them</em>, Hikari and Takeru included (as they <em>were</em> part of the team), would simply <em>wonder</em> where their friends went. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">played with</a> later on, as they start to show some concern over Ken at least due to his sudden reappearance as the Kaiser, while the others aren't even mentioned. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When Taichi and Daigo discover them being held in stasis along with the real Gennai, Taichi outright admits they had no idea they had even been captured.</span>

Lisanna's death is first mentioned in the Phantom Lord arc, and her siblings are seen going to pray for her near the anniversary of her death about 100 chapters later (not to mention <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her coming back</span>). Ur's death, which also happened in a back story, plays a large role in Gray's arc, and that she became part of the ocean at the end is actually a significant point <em>200</em> chapters later. And of course, the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Simon</span> comes up whenever Jellal is playing a large part in whatever is going on, even if it's usually pushed out of mind when Jellal isn't around.
</li><li> Weed of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GingaDensetsuWeed">Ginga Densetsu Weed</a></em> gets over the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his mother <em>extremely</em> fast</span>.

</li><li> Addressed in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin Series</a></em> where Tim finds Batman's "never looking back policy" annoying. Especially in regards to his fallen girlfriend Stephanie Brown (Spoiler/Robin IV) who didn't even get a memorial in the cave like Jason even if he understands the merit of not wallowing in grief and guilt over fallen friends and loved ones. He likes to take every opportunity to remind Bruce of those who have fallen as his allies—like Jason, Stephanie, Harold and Orpheus—despite Bruce's unwritten rule about never bringing any of them up.

As one of the main themes is 'there are no background characters', any death is treated very seriously and has long lasting effects on the other characters in intentional defiance of this trope. Most notably, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Starlight's</span> death in the G2 Apocalypse causing Patch to spend most of her life in denial over it and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sunset and Ranger's</span> deaths in the Shining Armor arc are continually brought up, grieved, and referenced even a few seasons later.

However, even the <em>writers</em> seem to have utterly forgotten about him when Season 3's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> episode came around and <em>no mention was made of his existence.</em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0zt75');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0zt75" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0zt75');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Granted, Jesse isn't the only casualty from "The Harvest" to get this treatment, but he's the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DrinkingGame/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DrinkingGame/TVTropes">Take a sip.</a></span> Jesse's form is also never assumed by The First, who worked really hard to dredge up memories of departed loved ones. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, his actor Eric Balfour was unavailable and Jesse was planned to come back to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hang a lampshade</a> over how his old friends had completely forgotten him. It's not until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">the Season 9 comics</a>, <em>years</em> after the show had come to an end, that Jesse gets a mention; when Xander helps Detective Dowling stake his vampirized partner, Xander recalls having to do the same to Jesse, and claims that to this very day, all he can see is the face of his friend, not the monster he became.
</li><li> Buffy's original Watcher, Merrick, killed himself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save Buffy from the vampire Lothos shortly before the series began. He's rarely mentioned at all outside of the prequel comics. Ironically, when Faith was introduced in Season 3, her Watcher's death <em>did</em> have a heavy impact on her... and shortly afterwards is <em>also</em> never mentioned again. We never even get her name.
</li><li> At the end of Season 1, Cordelia's boyfriend Kevin is killed with other students by a group of vampires. Although there's the implications that Cordelia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">dates lots of guys</a>, she had a conversation with Willow about how she was genuinely in love with this one, and is affected when she finds his body. She then never mentions him again in this show or its spinoff, <em>Angel</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Doctor's companion Nyssa has her father taken over by the Master in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> ending of <em>The Keeper of Traken</em>. In the following story, <em>Logopolis</em>, the Doctor meets Tegan, whose aunt the Master killed. Subsequently, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Master destroys Nyssa's planet and she discovers that he has stolen her father's body</span>. After <em>Four to Doomsday</em>, though, Nyssa never mentions it <em>at all</em>. Nyssa <em>does</em>, however, have a slight moment of shock and outrage in <em>Time-Flight</em> when she learns that the Master is there (having assumed he'd died at Castrovalva). The Doctor even <em>says</em>, "Yes, I'm sorry Nyssa," when she gives her response.
</li><li> Adric makes no direct mention of his brother following the latter's death in <em>Full Circle</em>, the closest he gets being the scene where he tells Romana: "One of my family's died for your lot already." Indeed, the only person to mention Adric's brother by name in any subsequent adventure is the Doctor in <em>Time-Flight</em>, by which time Adric has himself been killed. Apparently, actor Matthew Waterhouse was also upset about this not being brought up at all (his own brother had died by this time). However, there's a subtle hint towards the death for the observant viewers, seen in <em>Earthshock</em> — Adric, aware of his impending fate, is holding onto his brother's belt (given to him after Varsh's death) <em>like a security blanket</em>, as though to reassure himself in his final moments. It's not something everyone would pick up (given the belt looks like a thick rope), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">for those that do</a> ... Oh, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Adric</a></em>.
</li><li> The Doctor himself is prone to this. If you're not a companion, he'll be very upset to see you die, but probably have forgotten you minutes (or even seconds) after the fact. It's implied this is a coping mechanism for him to deal with the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet">everyone he knows</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">eventually dies</a>.
</li><li> Even when one of the Doctor's companions is permanently killed off, he or she is not exempt from this trope. Adric, for example, is only mentioned directly in a handful of post-<em>Earthshock</em> episodes, the last being Part Four of <em>The Caves of Androzani</em>, where the Doctor whispers Adric's name moments before regenerating into his sixth incarnation.
</li><li> Extreme example in "The Girl in the Fireplace" where the Doctor has an (allegedly passionate) love affair with Mme de Pompadour. By the next episode she's been forgotten, and is never mentioned again. In "Human Nature" he left Martha with instructions but never said what to do if he falls in love, implying he didn't consider it a real possibility though "The Girl in the Fireplace" was just a year ago. If "Deep Breath" is of any indication, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButForMeItWasTuesday">the Doctor barely remembers the events of the episode</a> (although this is more than 1000 years later from his perspective).
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em> characters who have been killed off have met this fate. They might be mentioned for a few episodes after their demise, but then never again. Understandable for the minor characters, but even Mark Greene, who'd been the central figure of the show for 8 seasons, got only a few referrals after his death.
</li><li> Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, after Crichton <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">finally gets back to Earth</span>, an assassin <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">tortures</a> and kills his two best friends</span> and is only mentioned once after that, when Scorpius asks his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Old Master</a> about the assassin's species and origin. Though it's clear that Crichton was having a something of a falling-out with said friends over his sharing of alien technologies. It's not even entirely clear that Crichton ever learned they died; the creature attacked his family shortly afterwards and the crew hightailed it off Earth after defeating it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> is normally good at remembering dead characters, even many episodes after their death. A few exceptions include:
<ul><li> While Robb and Catelyn are frequently mentioned after the Red Wedding and the surviving Starks and their supporters want to avenge their deaths, as well as the deaths of the other Northern lords killed at the Red Wedding, Talisa — Robb's pregnant wife — is never mentioned again. While it's true that many of the people she was friends with are also killed, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">justified</a> for the surviving Starks as they weren't even able to learn who she was, it's still relatively jarring for a major character. The one time a Northern Lord mentions Talisa posthumously, she's referred to as a "foreign whore".
</li><li> Rakharo, Daenerys' bloodrider, is also yet to be mentioned after his death in Season 2.
</li><li> Locke, a good friend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">Ramsay Bolton</a>, had successfully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">faked friendship</a> with Jon Snow and Jon's circle in an attempt to harm or assassinate Jon and his two younger brothers — Bran and Rickon Stark — and Locke is never mentioned again after what the Night Watch characters believe to have been a heroic death. It is justified because shortly after they return to Castle Black, they have other problems to deal with, such as Mance's army and the White Walkers. However, some of Jon's other friends die, and he mourns them. Locke also seems to be pretty tight with Ramsay, but after his death is never mentioned by Ramsay again. You'd think Ramsay would at least bring him up to mess with Jon, but nope.
</li><li> Benjen Stark has hardly been mentioned since his disappearance, despite one of main missions of the great ranging being to investigate the disappearing rangers. Jon fails to ask the wildlings about his uncle while gathering information as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defector</a> but the claim of his uncle's return is used on Jon by the Watch mutineers to lure Jon outside so they can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">assassinate him in a mutiny</span>.
</li><li> Subverted by Mycah the butcher's boy. While some viewers might only vaguely remember his unjust death in "The Kingsroad," Arya never forgets and his unjust death remains at the center of her hatred for Sandor Clegane. Arya even brings up Mycah during the Hound's trial in "And Now His Watch Is Ended" and the Hound uses it in his attempt to goad her in "The Children." Arya also remembers Lommy's death and takes revenge on his murderer, killing him the same way he killed Lommy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em> is also doing this with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">George</span>. He was a main character for five seasons, then after the first two episodes of Season 6, has only been mentioned twice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>: Caitlin who? Never heard of any Simone. Yaeko? Charlie? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Possible Lampshade/Subversion of Charlie's death in Season 4</span> Who are these people? Conveniently, with Simone dead, there's nobody to cry for Isaac.
<ul><li> Theres possible exception of <strike> Alixander</strike> <strike> Alejandro</strike> Dead Twin: the only people who knew of him on the show are Sylar (his killer) and Molly and Maya, the last two having been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>.
</li><li> The trope was lampshaded later by Sylar. It went something like this: "What was his name again? Ted...Ted something. Ted... It's on the tip of my tongue." A few moments later... "Sprague! Ted Sprague! That was his name."
</li><li> Matt Parkman reunites with his ex-wife after discovering he has a son, despite her history of infidelity, and apparently forgets all about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his deceased girlfriend Daphne Millbrook</span>, whose murder nearly led him attempt to exact <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">Revenge by Proxy</a> on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the girlfriend of Emil Danko, Daphne's killer</span> and basically sapped him of the will to live.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> had its share of such problems. While Duncan held rivalries with other Immortals ongoing for centuries, he rarely went after mortals. Regardless of what they did to him or his loved ones. From 1980 to 1993, Duncan's love interest was mortal Tessa Noel. A main character until early in the second season, Tessa was killed by a junkie over some petty change. Duncan never bothers to search for the killer. When Richard Ryan, a student of Duncan, managed to locate the junkie, Duncan refuses to lift a finger against him. Ryan eventually lets the guy go, once convinced the junkie has quit the habit and is now a struggling father. After that Tessa rarely gets mentioned. Similarly, a number of killed lovers or best friends such as Mei-Ling Shen, Brian Cullen or Nefertiri are greatly mourned in the single episode featuring them. Then never mentioned again, even in episodes summarizing the key moments of the character.
<ul><li> Actually, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a> features a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">It's a Wonderful Plot</a> in which Duncan finds himself in a world in which he had never existed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a> all characters live miserable lives or are evil, and Duncan wants to undo what has happened. Until he discovers that in this reality Tessa is very much alive.
</li><li> On the same note, several episodes have Duncan trying to get other Immortals to quit their quest of vengeance against mortals. With several of them having some pretty good reasons to seek revenge. Ceirdwyn going after the people who killed her mortal husband, Kamir killing the people who smuggled India's cultural treasures to American museums, Muhammad ibn Kassim targeting the dictator of his country, Katya of Greenhil struggling to avenge the murder of her adoptive daughter, Jacob Galati hunting the people who butchered his wife, William Kingsley wanting to punish whoever killed his wife and those covering for them, Ingrid Henning going after any would-be dictator and hatemonger in hope of preventing a new Holocaust, and Everett Bellian waging war against the rapist of his adoptive daughter. Apparently they should have all forgotten their foes and let go. Somehow, this would seem rather difficult.
</li></ul></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Archie Kennedy</span> dies a heroic death in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> episode "Retribution" ... then is never mentioned again for the rest of the series. Similarly, in the first episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Clayton</span> sacrifices himself to save Horatio's life; Horatio seems to remember him and mourn his death but Archie, his former shipmate, seems to forget him entirely almost immediately.
<ul><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieBamber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamieBamber">Jamie Bamber</a> character meets this fate. Matt Devlin of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK">Law &amp; Order: UK</a></em> is gunned down at the end of Season 5, and aside from the follow-up episode which focused on the search for and prosecution of his killer is never mentioned again. Quite glaring considering that he was a surrogate son to his grief-stricken partner Ronnie and in a later episode, when yet another friend of Ronnie's is similarly murdered, no one mentions how similar the two incidents are. The only slight exception is the mention that Ronnie's grandson is named Matthew, obviously in his memory (he was born the day Matt was killed), but even that fails to spark any discussion of him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KillingEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KillingEve">Killing Eve</a></em>: Villanelle's murder of Bill motivated Eve for probably a whole season and is even one interpretation for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stabbing Villanelle at the end of Season 1.</span> However, from Season 2 onwards, Bill's death is never mentioned and it never stands in the way of Eve and Villanelle's relationship.

However, those events are never so much as alluded to outside of Ellison holding a newspaper headlined "Chaos Under The Streets" in Karen's intro episode, or a shrine in the background when Frank is in Karen's apartment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>: Season 2 makes absolutely no mention of the events of <em>The Defenders</em>, and Jessica seems to have completely forgotten about the loss of Matt, who she had grown the closest with during <em>The Defenders</em>, except for an oblique reference to "heroes dying". Much of this has to do with the fact that Melissa Rosenberg had started writing <em>Jessica Jones</em> season 2 before <em>The Defenders</em> began its writing process, which explains why the show feels as if it took place immediately after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronFist2017">Iron Fist</a></em> season 1, and <em>The Defenders</em> never happened. Rosenberg also had to temporarily halt production of <em>Jessica Jones</em> to allow for production of <em>The Defenders</em>.

The events at Midland Circle in which Matt "died" are relevant, but more because of how Misty lost her arm there and is now getting adjusted to her new robotic right arm. There's a subtle reference to Matt, though, as Foggy Nelson appears in one scene and, recalling the costume Matt wore in the first season of <em>Daredevil</em>, suggests Luke wear a mask to maintain some level of anonymity. It later turns out comparing him to Luke is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> to the latter, which Claire finds out the hard way.

Curtis mourns her and then learns from Seth that his ability has been sold to an old Jewish man hoping to kill Hitler, leaving Curtis unable to help Nikki. She is never mentioned after that, and two episodes later Curtis gets a new love interest. It becomes egregious later in Season 3 when Seth gives Curtis the power of resurrection in order to bring back his dead girlfriend Shannon, and the latter seems to have forgotten that he also has <em>another</em> deceased girlfriend.
</li><li> Sheriff Graham in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> fits this to a tee.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em>, Captain Kirk suffers (in the first episode in which he appears) the loss of a friend he's had for many years, whom he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">himself was forced to kill.</a> Further along in the series, he also suffers the loss of his brother. And yet, the only death that seemed to affect him long term was the death of main, recurring character Spock (which didn't even stick). Although Kirk has had and lost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">many love interests</a> over the course of the show, he doesn't seem all that affected by their passing. (Granted, in at least two cases, he was made to forget that they had ever existed, but one would think he would at least remember and dwell upon Edith Keeler from time to time...)
</li><li> This happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings">Stranger Things</a></em> to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Barb, who, despite being searched for for the majority of the first season by Nancy, her eventual death was only mourned for a short moment, and she was never mentioned again</span>. This didn't go over well with viewers, for whom Barb had become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Ensemble Dark Horse</a>, so the writers had to address this in season 2. Nancy and Steve visit Barbs parents regularly and Nancys guilt over Barbs death leads to her breakup with Steve. Nancy leads the charge in getting justice for Barb by exposing the government agency responsible for her death showing that Nancy, at least, has not forgotten about her friend.
</li><li> A version of this occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>. As far as the main characters are concerned, deceased friends are often mentioned and grieved on the show. However, there are a huge number of one-episode characters who watch their family and friends die in horrible ways, are traumatised for the majority of the episode, and then miraculously recover toward the end. One particularly noticeable example is the body-swap episode, where two teenagers are partially responsible for the gruesome death of their best friend, but by the end of the episode are too distracted by their love lives to remember that his body is still lying in his basement.
<ul><li> The Winchesters do react this way in one particularly glaring instance regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostSibling">their brother</a>, Adam</span>. Ever since the fifth season finale he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABusToHell">rotting in hell</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being tortured by Lucifer and Michael</span>. Dean only mentioned him once but then seems to have forgotten about him completely. Apparently the Winchesters are perfectly content to leave him in hell for all eternity, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">despite their "family comes first" motto and both of them having been traumatized by their own trips to hell</span>.
<ul><li> This was <em>finally</em> acknowledged in the 200th episode, in which Sam and Dean assist in a musical adaptation of the in-universe book series based on their lives. In the finale, when the Winchester family sings "Carry On My Wayward Son", Sam fails to recognize a character and asks one girl who he is. She replies "Oh, that's Adam. John Winchester's other kid. He's still trapped in the cage, in Hell. With Lucifer." Sam and Dean immediately look at each other with discomfort. However, when the Cage is brought back in Season 11, Adam is still not alluded in any fashion.
</li><li> He's finally brought back in the final season though, now having agreed to share his body equally with Michael.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with when it comes to Jessica. Her death motivated Sam to go back to hunting, but after that, her mentions are few and far between.

Aside from the sheer number of classmates and recurring characters killed off unceremoniously, regular character Jenny lost her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">long-time best friend</span> in the third episode, never to mention her again. True to form, after spending a season trying to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">track down her long-lost father</span>, Jenny seemingly forgets he ever existed after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dear old dad dies after using the Book of Pure Evil (co-incidentally in the following season's third episode)</span>.

<ul><li> Stefan's "Uncle" Zach dies in the fifth episode. While Stefan mourns him in the episode itself, the character very quickly becomes a footnote in the series' history after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFakedForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFakedForYou">his death is covered up</a> without anyone finding out the truth. He isn't mentioned again until the <em>sixth</em> season where he is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revealed to have a daughter</span>.
</li><li> Subverted with Lexi. Despite only appearing in one episode, she is mentioned by Stefan several times since her death and she appears in almost every season of the show, either in flashbacks or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a ghost</span>. Stefan admits the reason he doesn't talk about her much is that it brings up memories of her death. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she and Stefan even end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">Together in Death</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">in a platonic way</a>)</span>.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Anna</span> dies at the end of the first season. She is then not mentioned again. In fact some people who started watching in the second season asked why Jeremy was so unfriendly to his uncle, because the fact that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> murdered his girlfriend never comes up</span>. What makes this more bizarre is that a season later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Anna returns as a ghost. After she passes on, Elena attributes Jeremy's downward spiral to Bonnie breaking up with him, apparently forgetting they broke up because he was still in love Anna who, as far as Jeremy knows, is still trapped totally alone in the ghost world, unwilling or unable to appear to him again</span>. Not that this is the only death where the dead person is quickly not mentioned again, but it's made particularly obvious because it happens <em>twice</em> to the same character.

Alys' death in <em>IV</em> is not only honored with an actual grave, her left-behind house and belongings in it and her entire <em>hometown</em> noting her absence, the people closest to her reference her death and the meaning of what she taught while she was alive, <em>and</em> one of the later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">possible</span> wise-mentor figures actually <em>uses</em> her image to manipulate her student. Nei's death hit <em>Phantasy Star II</em> and its fanbase so hard she became a legacy character whose name or image appears in every Phantasy Star game since then. And <em>all of them</em> were honored in a cutscene in the fourth game, specifically to remind Chaz of the worth of their cause.

</li><li> While "friend" is pushing the term, no-one on the Predacons seem upset at Scorponok and Terrorsaur's fiery deaths, much less mentions them afterward. Meanwhile, with the Maximals, Tigertron and Airazor are completely forgotten after they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">get teleported off-planet by the Vok</a>.
</li><li> Conversely, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em>, Optimus Primal spends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">way too long</a> mourning the loss of his allies.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em> when Grandpa Max <em>blows himself to nonexistence</em> in front of Ben. Ben protests the move beforehand but after the fact he basically says "Let's get on with the mission" and leaves it at that. They visit the effect of Max's death later, but only with Gwen; Ben doesn't seem to care at that point. Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">Max got better</a>, so it's ultimately moot.
<ul><li> It's arguably worse in "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" and "Grounded," each of which features one of Max's sons. They don't seem particularly concerned that their father supposedly died — despite the former episode's events being triggered in part by just that.
</li></ul></li><li> Heavily mocked on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em> with Ponce de Leon. What makes it more ridiculous is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">no one mentioned Poncey</a> <em>before</em> his death either.
</li><li> Spoofed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> when Captain Hero becomes friends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Popeye">Popeye</a>: after the latter dies of AIDS, Hero wants to mourn him by "winning" the AIDS awareness marathon (that is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">killing all other participants</a>). At the end of the marathon, Hero looks up in the sky, seeing an image of Popeye, and doesn't even recognize him.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Captain Hero</strong>: I did it Popeye. I did it for you! <br/><em>(Popeye's face appears in the clouds)</em> <br/><strong>Captain Hero</strong>: Who the hell is that asshole?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">Motive Decay</a>: Peter's favorite teacher from Junior High is fired after Peter convinces him to go off his medication. When Lois, running for school board, says she agrees with the firing, Peter vows to run against her in order to get his teacher's job back. Eventually though, Peter's competitiveness dominates the campaign, to the extent that when the teacher is brought up later, Peter doesn't remember him. Interestingly, a post credit sequence implies that the teacher did get his job back, but was then killed by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RoboCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RoboCop">ED-209</a> Hall Monitor droid Peter installed.
</li><li> In "Life of Brian", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the eponymous dog dies. The Griffins buy another dog, Vinnie, and they quickly find peace. Only Stewie is outraged, and he keeps Brian's memory alive by sharing his feelings with Vinnie</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoonaticsUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LoonaticsUnleashed">Loonatics Unleashed</a></em>, Ace and Rev supposedly perish in an accident, leading to Lexi to give a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a> and even shed a tear. It is directed pretty much entirely towards Ace.
</li><li> In the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PacificHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PacificHeat">Pacific Heat</a></em>, Maddie befriends a stripper named Angie who is murdered by the episode's villain, and she is upset when her teammates can't even be bothered to remember Angie's name. After that episode, Angie is never mentioned again.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Narti</span> ultimately falls into this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lotor kills her for being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a></span>, her teammates are visibly upset by this and apparently defect over it... Only, she's never mentioned again in the following seasons, and the rest of her squad <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">eventually goes back to following Lotor</span>.
</li><li> For five seasons, Kenny was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyKilledKennyAgain">Ever Forgotten Ever Falling Friend</a>.
<ul><li> Lampshaded in "Cherokee Hair Tampons", where Stan is weeping over the fact that Kyle will die if he doesn't get a new kidney. Kenny, aware of Stan's complete apathy to his own deaths, storms off offended and meets his usual elaborate death just a few steps prior. Stan completely ignores it and continues sobbing over Kyle.
</li><li> Also, when a character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> (such as Chef, Cartman's Grandma, Ms. Crabtree, etc.), they are often never referred to again after their death episode; people who hadn't seen the respective death episodes could assume these characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">just disappeared</a>.
</li><li> Parodied in "Kenny Dies", where Kenny dies of a muscular illness (in which he was originally intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>). Unlike previous episodes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">everyone is genuinely devastated and dumbfounded by his death</a>. This actually carries on for several episodes, though predictably the boys soon get over it, and even use callously their friend's death to manipulate people. A season later, Kenny returns, to the nonchalance of everyone.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Terra</span>, who died in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> at the end of Season 2 only to never be mentioned again by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her former teammates</span>. At least not until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her sudden return</span> in the show's final episode.
</li><li> Morph's death hits the other characters hard in the 2-part series premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, after which he's not mentioned again until the Season 2 premiere (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which reveals he was brought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a></span>).
</li><li> The team's reaction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> episode "Failsafe" when all of the Justice League are killed within the first 10 minutes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Of course, they knew it was only a simulation and not real (at least until the simulation goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a>).</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life  </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This may also be a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. It doesn't seem that unlikely that a crusade started for one reason may continue on its own momentum. See some people's feelings about the post-9/11 wars, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a>'s story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OurDumbCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OurDumbCentury">Our Dumb Century</a></em> where Archduke Franz Ferdinand was found alive and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> was called off as a result.
<ul><li> The actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrusades">Crusades</a> began when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ByzantineEmpire">Byzantine Empire</a> asked for Western help against the encroaching Muslim Turks. A little over a century later, the Fourth Crusade attacked and heavily damaged the Empire, and nowadays Turkey still controls Byzantium (Istanbul).
</li><li> Also, there's a pretty good chance that the person whose friend/relative/whoever died could be subconsciously using the crusade as a substitute for their fallen friend, which prevents them from feeling the full impact of the loss, or even thinking of the person at all, even though the bottled up grief will keep them going. Remember that keeping themselves occupied so that it gives them something to do other than mourn is a quite common occurrence among people who have lost loved ones.
