</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>:
<ul><li> The First Doctor would often gesture with his hands close to his face. Peter Purves, who played his companion Steven Taylor, said that this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamHartnell">William Hartnell</a>'s response to not being able to gesture broadly in the same way as you could on stage, because TV was "small" (i.e., it didn't capture all the action across the whole set all the time). He would also flutter his hands when trying to decide something. He also tended to <a class="urllink" href="http://images.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/The-first-doctor-timelords-270820_395_597.jpg">clutch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> at his <a class="urllink" href="http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101211235108/tardis/images/f/f1/William_hartnell_farewell.jpg">jacket lapels.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> He often ends sentences with a distinctive 'hmm?' and ful-fblu-I mean-flubs his lines (although never breaking character), even becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">The Unintelligible</a> at times, and tends to deliberately forget people's names as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousMisnaming">Malicious Misnaming</a>, particularly with Chesterton (stemming from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Throw It In!</a> of the actor's tendency to forget the character's name in the first few serials). His movements tend to be quite jerky, almost to the point of trembling, and his facial expressions tend towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSmiler">smirky</a>.
</li><li> The Second Doctor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PatrickTroughton">Patrick Troughton</a>) had a habit of <a class="urllink" href="http://i1192.photobucket.com/albums/aa323/ticktoast/TeamTwohastoomuchsexy_zps5120743c.png">wringing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://i1192.photobucket.com/albums/aa323/ticktoast/TwoandtheIceWarriors_zpse64a3692.png">his<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://i1192.photobucket.com/albums/aa323/ticktoast/teamtwohitsanuh-oh_zps37a4245a.png">hands<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> constantly. The Eleventh Doctor imitated this. If he couldn't wring his hands, he'd twiddle his fingers and drum them on things, such as his other hand. Also lots and lots of eyebrow quirking.
</li><li> The Third Doctor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a>):
<ul><li> He had a habit of saying, "Yes, well" to start his sentences, answering "Yes, of course", humming a ditty when tinkering on things, displaying a half-interested attitude when people try talking to him while he's working with lab equipment, and touting a very cheeky grin when he makes a clever joke.
</li><li> John Levene, who played Benton, pointed out in a DVD commentary that once Pertwee realized he had a habit of rubbing his neck, his conscious attempts to stop resulted in a habit of touching his mouth, and his conscious attempts to stop that resulted in a habit of rubbing his neck again. Occasionally he touches his ear, just to mix it up.
</li><li> He tends to speak with his hands on his hips or leaning up against things if he's in a happy mood, and has very dramatic, sharp movements.
</li></ul></li><li> The Fourth Doctor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a>) is <em>made</em> of these. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy">He even invented a lot of standard tics used by many later Doctors</a>:
<ul><li> He almost constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyePop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyePop">boggles his eyes out</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyBlueEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyBlueEyes">stares at things unsettlingly</a>. You will rarely see him blink on screen, even if you're looking for it. His eyes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadEye">don't quite point in the same direction</a>, especially when he's panicking, surprised or in a loopy mood.
</li><li> His distinctive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheshireCatGrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheshireCatGrin">grin</a> is a thing of pure horror and deployed generously. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherEccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a> borrowed a dead-eyed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero">Hurting Hero</a> version of it for his Doctor.)
</li><li> He tends to run his hand through his hair when he's about to concentrate on something. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidTennant">David Tennant</a> borrowed this for his Doctor too.) Occasionally fiddles with it if he's in a happy mood - see Peter Davison's impression of this, then being shocked at his new hair, in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E1Castrovalva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS19E1Castrovalva">Castrovalva</a>" for a really funny moment.
</li><li> He generally has the opposite energy level of everything around him. If people around him are stern and serious, he'll be in a wild, hyperactive hurry; if people around him are panicking, he'll be motionless and even somewhat bored.
</li><li> When really angry, he will snap in a surprisingly high-pitched voice compared to his usual tone.
</li><li> Saying "What!" whenever he heard something he didn't like.
</li><li> Cocking his head and going "Ah, <em>well</em>..." whenever he was about to deliver <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">technobabble</a>. (David Tennant deliberately invoked that last one with his Doctor too.)
</li><li> Cheeky little hand-waves.
</li><li> A lot of his gestures call attention to his unusually big and awkward-looking nose - tapping or pushing on the side for 'on the nose' or 'it's a secret', prodding it, pinching the bridge or the tip in frustration, stroking it in thought.... even the very few times he's being flirty he tends to do so by delicately touching his nose.
</li><li> He would often step on his scarf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">by accident</a>, which always makes him cross.
</li><li> When entering a corridor or entering a room, he always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEntrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEntrance">strikes a pose, rushes in flapping all over the place or enters in some other weird way</a>, with Tom Baker's aim being to 'never enter a room the same way twice'. This supposedly started from frustration with the lack of camera angle and lighting variation possible in most of the cheap sets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a> used and the stereotypical <em>Doctor Who</em> fascination with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Padding">substituting action</a> with running down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledSet">identical corridors</a>, and so becomes very obvious in the more claustrophobic and corridor-based serials, like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E1HorrorOfFangRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E1HorrorOfFangRock">Horror of Fang Rock</a>". Since the Fourth Doctor is a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">a ham to end all hams</a>, it works really well.
</li><li> He <em>never</em> looks at his hands when going for his pockets, so whenever he does he flails his hands around in a rather comical fashion before finding them.
</li><li> He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OralFixation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OralFixation">really likes having things in his mouth</a>. Whenever he's fixing, making or sabotaging some sort of device, he will inevitably put one of the tools or parts into his mouth to hold it while he works on it with his hands, even if it'd make more sense for him to just put the item down. If nothing's available he tends to chew on his thumbnail. (This is deliberately alluded to in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS34E1DeepBreath">Deep Breath</a>" when the post-regenerative-traumatised Twelve bites his thumb while contemplating how much he needs a really long scarf.) He also has a habit of licking his lips whenever he's excited. (David Tennant borrowed this one, too!)
</li><li> If there is a chair he has a standard routine where he will begin to sit on it, and then has a sudden flash of insight just before touching the seat and stands back up again. Particularly hilarious in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E6TheSeedsOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS13E6TheSeedsOfDoom">The Seeds of Doom</a>" where he actually brings a chair over from another room just to do this to it.
</li><li> If he's sitting down he tends to put his legs up on anything he can - other people's desks, and so on. Note particularly when he props his legs up on the top of Bessie's windscreen in his first story - something the Third Doctor would find unthinkable.
</li><li> Remember Sarah Jane's line in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E3SchoolReunion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E3SchoolReunion">School Reunion</a>" about the Doctor 'stroking' the TARDIS? This is the Doctor she was talking about. Note particularly the funny way the Sutekh-Doctor caresses the door switch open in the last part of "Pyramids of Mars".
</li></ul></li><li> Like with the First Doctor, the Sixth Doctor had a tendency to clutch his jacket lapels.
</li><li> The Seventh Doctor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy">Sylvester McCoy</a>) had his rrrolling Rrrs. He also flapped and fluttered his hands around ebulliently. He likes to twitch his eyebrows up and down rapidly when being deliberately funny.
</li><li> The Eighth Doctor (in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures">novels</a>, anyway) had a habit of repeating words five or six times whenever he was excited or upset. He would also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">stand right in people's faces</a>, totally oblivious to how uncomfortable they might be. And of course, he also had a tendency to kiss people without warning...
</li><li> The Ninth Doctor tended to do a big, toothy grin often accompanied with cute little hand gestures, directly lifted from the Fourth Doctor; the key difference being that Four looked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenSheSmiles">genuinely happy and adorable when he did it</a>, even if he was being alien and terrifying, and the Ninth manages to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyASmile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicallyASmile">just look alien and terrifying</a>. His genuine smiles are simultaneously both more toned down, and bigger and goofier. He seems to attempt to make his eyes bulge out Four-style too, but the actor just can't do it, instead compensating by raising his eyebrows up really, really high. When being serious, he tends to punctuate his speech with sharp little head-nods to draw emphasis to certain words. He was also found of doing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmFold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmFold">Badass Arm-Fold</a>.
</li><li> The Tenth Doctor:
<ul><li> He runs his hands through his hair when he's frustrated.
</li><li> He dramatically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGlasses">dons his glasses when it's time to look clever</a> (borrowed from the Fifth Doctor).
</li><li> He presses his tongue to the roof of his mouth when he's thinking or working on something.
</li><li> "...and my voice going all squeaky when I shouted, I still do that! I got that from you." ("You" being the Fifth Doctor.)
</li><li> Shoving his hands in his pockets when confronting enemies or antagonistic characters.
</li><li> Rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet while talking, especially to aforementioned enemies and antagonists.
</li><li> Pulling on his earlobe or rubbing the back of his neck when uncomfortable or embarrassed (usually brought on by Donna).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://s3.vidimg.popscreen.com/original/15/RkJnbjRQSUZ6eHcx_o_a-tribute-to-david-tennants-left-eyebrow.jpg">The Left Eyebrow.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> It has its own Tumblr page.
</li><li> The long, drawn-out "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/RssnpE9U6IU">Well...<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" when he's about to explain something (borrowed from the Fourth Doctor).
</li></ul></li><li> The Eleventh Doctor:
<ul><li> Drawing things in the air to arrive at epiphanies.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://cdn1.screenrant.com/wp-content/uploads/Neil-Gaiman-The-Doctors-wife.jpg">Wringing his hands<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> when nervous or when musing things over (See also; The Second Doctor down)
</li><li> Flapping his hands in a "what the heck do I do with <em>these?!"</em>-manner when kissed.
</li><li> Turning 270 degrees to the right to turn left (and the other way around). (This is why he's walking with a cane in 'The Time Of The Doctor'. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattSmith">Matt Smith</a> tore the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)">meniscus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in his knee doing this.)
</li><li> Randomly spinning in a full circle.
</li><li> Fiddling with his bowtie before embarking on a course of action and/or after arguing with someone.
</li><li> Repeating words over and over when flustered, often changing their tone each time "Yes yes yes of course yes of course!" etc.
</li><li> Snapping his fingers before pointing at someone or something, which he does before explaining something about said person or thing.
</li></ul></li><li> The Thirteenth Doctor:
<ul><li> Scrunching her face up when she's confused or frustrated.
</li><li> Bending her entire torso backwards when she's voicing said frustration.
</li><li> Pressing her lips tightly together in stressful or serious moments. (Fans have dubbed this the "Polite Thirteen"-face due to its resemblance to the <a class="urllink" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/polite-cat">Polite Cat meme<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
</li><li> She has two tics in correspondence to anger: the aforementioned face scrunching, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">an emotionless stare combined with very quiet and flat speech</a>, though the last is also used for moments of helplessness.
</li></ul></li><li> The tics of the first four Doctors are imitated by the Fifth Doctor in his state of confusion after having regenerated. Particularly amusing is when he goes to bury his hand into his curls Four-style, realises he has shorter, straight hair now, and <a class="urllink" href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1kottwTaq1qfigugo1_250.gif">has a puzzled, disappointed reaction<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> The impressionist Jon Culshaw is a big <em>Doctor Who</em> fanboy (admitting his taste for velvet jackets is stolen from the Third Doctor) and discusses these endlessly. There's a video <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MifZSkGWfvc">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of him discussing the main, defining Character Tic of each Doctor for the amusement of David Tennant. (In his words, and in order starting with the Second Doctor and skipping the Eighth: "a scowl", "very sharp" mannerisms, "eyes and teeth and the alien-ness", "hands in his pockets, must dash!!", "tends to enunciate... Hmm! Howveryinteresting!! Mmm!", "fingers and thumbs", "with his swagger and the jacket on", "another kind of eyes and teeth".)
</li><li> During Series 5, Amy would occasionally bulge her eyes and pucker her mouth — known to fans as the :I face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarenGillan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarenGillan">Karen Gillan</a> seemed to be making a conscious effort to stop this, as Amy didn't do this tic during the entirety of Series 6. She also has a habit of crying silently.

He flips his hair, strikes a particular pose with one hand on his hip and his leg forward, and does a very distinctive over-the-top full-body shrug. He also tends to grab his mouth and tap his foot while thinking, and scratch the back of his head. When freaking out he grabs his head with both hands and shakes.
</li><li> Barret loves pumping his forearm for emphasis.

</li><li> Sephiroth has a distinctive laugh where he will slump his shoulders &amp; laugh with such force that he started to shake, a laugh he shares with his father, Hojo. He would also raise and spread his arms, and look up at the sky while giving speeches.
</li><li> Hojo walks with his hands clasped behind his back.
</li><li> A rather odd example occurs when near the beginning of the game, Cloud has to engage in a contest with body builders, doing the most squats in a time limit without screwing up.

</li><li> While not exactly this trope, Sephiroth never blinks, and has extremely shallow breathing animations, even while tossing buildings at Cloud. He also has a distinctively light, acrobatic way of moving that he didn't in the game. He also never lets go of or sheathes his sword, which is odd, because he was always leaving it behind in the original game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>:
<ul><li> As in most other games, all of the characters have a defined pose they do when initiating/ending a fight which shows of their individuality. Squall will rest his Gunblade on his shoulder and swing it a couple of times and cooly turn his back against the opponent. Zell warms up before a fight and loudly celebrates shaking his fists in the air after winning. Quistis, being the elegant, collected one, lashes with her whip going into a fray and afterwards stretches and relaxes. Selphie, the spirited and spunky girl, throws her arms in the air before resting her Nunchaku on her shoulders and doing a sassy pose. Irvine, in keeping with his cool sniper façade, twirls his rifle around and cockily salutes with his hat, whereas Rinoa, the high-class rebel girl who is new to fighting, seems a bit nervous and sighs in relief then the battle is over. Pretty much every action each character does, like casting a spell or even sitting, will be animated in a particular way to showcase their personality.
</li><li> Squall adjusts his weight. A lot. Standing still on the World Map lets you watch him constantly adjusting his standing position. He also facepalms. A lot. He enters battle with his Gunblade resting over his shoulder and ends it by doing the same. Later on, in Dissidia, this becomes his default stance. As a verbal tic, "Whatever" and "..." comprise a sizable portion of his "dialogue". Finally, when Squall is in a critical situation such as facing a tough decision, he tends to throw his arm horizontally across his face VERY dramatically.
</li><li> Selphie tilts her head to the side several times, tends to dance in place, pumps her fist in the air and will occasionally pull up one leg, then the other, like she's checking the bottom of her shoes. She will also throw her arms down to her sides when arguing, and trust her to immediately lay down on the nearest bed available, spreading her arms wide like she owns the place.
</li><li> Rinoa has her trademark "Point towards the sky" pose. She also will brush her hair off her forehead repeatedly and tends to squat and almost hug her legs when feeling vulnerable. She's prone to "cute" gestures, such as dangling her feet when she sits.
</li><li> Zell shadowboxes. Like, a LOT, whenever he grows bored, which drives Seifer up the wall. He also punches the ground at times (which is actually one of his Limit Break finisher moves) and most of his gestures are very exaggerated to showcase his loud persona.
</li><li> Irvine, who tries hard to look like a cool, detached cowboy-sniper, will typically tend to strike cool poses, touch his hat and take aim at things with an imaginary pistol. He also sways his hands around, similar to Jack Sparrow.
</li><li> Quistis' gestures showcase her smart-elegant characterization. She will only laugh when putting her hand up to her face to cover he mouth, for example, and when she sits, she'll do it like her legs are glued together, the way a "proper lady" in Japanese culture would.
</li><li> Seifer, the cocky jerk anti-villain, will wave his Gunblade around at the first opportunity he gets and is always pointing at people with it. We're talking cutscenes, not battle here, mind you.
</li><li> Even characters who don't get as much screen time have them. Laguna has a limp that manifests itself only when nervous (usually around the object of his affections) and rubs the back of his head a lot, Kiros, a cool, reserved guy will cross his arms over his chest and Ward will wave his hand in front of his face to indicate something it's a bad idea, a character trait he shares with Raijin. His partner, Fujin, only speaks in one-word sentences, despite showing on occasion that she's capable of speaking normally. She'll also throw her hand to the side a lot.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>: All characters have their own poses and gestures, and Phoenix's dramatic finger point is among the most distinctive. The new prosecutor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</a></em>, Klavier Gavin, even <em>air guitars</em> when things are going particularly well for him.
<ul><li> This is actually a key gameplay mechanic in <em>Apollo Justice</em>; if you have no evidence to refute a testimony that is obviously false, chances are the witness is playing with her ring, or he's sweating profusely, or something similar; Apollo can "Perceive" these and call out these nervous twitches by way of an incredible talent to read people.
</li><li> Phoenix's most famous tic is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingSomeoneThePointerFinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GivingSomeoneThePointerFinger">Giving Someone the Pointer Finger</a> pose, but one of other poses is also very noticeable: his nervous one, where he's hunched over, eyes are half closed, teeth gritted and sweat going down the side of his face like a waterfall. He does it so much, it's even used more than his standard standing pose. The main reason this is notable is that in the sequel, Apollo Justice has his own versions of all of Phoenix' tics, including the nervous pose, but he doesn't do it nearly as much.
</li><li> Athena also has her fair share of tics, but one actually stands out as the developers have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>: whenever she enters a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>, she <em><a class="urllink" href="http://aceattorney.fandom.com/wiki/File:Athena_Cykes_-_breakdown.gif">covers her ears<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></em>. This is actually a known habit of patients with <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperacusis">hyperacousis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, AKA overly sensitive hearing, which they do to block out overbearing sounds. Her other tics include her playing with her earring when she's thinking, and rubbing her ponytail whenever she's embarrassed.
</li><li> Klavier Gavin, as mentioned above, air guitars. But much more present is his finger snapping. He nearly constantly does this, as if listening to an invisible beat.
</li><li> Kristoph Gavin, when contradicted or feeling aggressive, tilts his head forward so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryShinyGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryShinyGlasses">light flashes across his spectacles</a>.

</li><li> Manfred Von Karma from the first game folds his arms a lot, eyes closed and squeezing his sleeves while doing so. The first thing we see of his daughter Franziska in the sequel is the same exact pose, causing the first impression to be that of uncanny resemblance from her father. Phoenix also notices something else
<div class="indent"> "Of all the things to inherit from her father, why did it have to be that smarmy smile?"
</div><ul><li> Also used to great effect in the third game. In the first, Manfred Von Karma had another particular trait of sticking his arm out and wagging his finger obnoxiously. The third game has a case that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">takes place in the past, with Phoenix' mentor Mia being the Defense. The opposition is a younger Edgeworth, who has all his familiar poses and tics, and... his mentor's obnoxious finger wag, showing the great influence he had on him.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Von Karma also has one more significant tic: putting his hand on his shoulder when nervous. It seems like just another nervous pose until you learn that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he got shot in the shoulder from a gun that accidentally fired. He used the same gun to kill Edgeworth's father, but just so the evidence that he's the killer isn't found, he didn't remove it surgically and it remained lodged in his shoulder for fifteen years.</span>
<ul><li> When von Karma appears as the rival for the flashback segment of case 3 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">Gyakuten Kenji 2</a></em>, all of his animations are the same as game 1, with the exception of one: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his nervous sprite. It's the same as his original game 1 sprite, but he doesn't clutch his shoulder. The case is <em>before</em> the DL-6 Incident, when he got shot in the shoulder.</span>
</li><li> Franziska has a very similar nervous sprite. Though it's not as obvious at first glance since she grabs <em>both</em> shoulders.
</li></ul></li><li> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with the Phantom, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfDisguise">Master of Disguise</a> who can flawlessly impersonate anyone in the setting, right down their tics. It turns out that he does have one unique to himself, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which is reaching for his gun holster. This clues Apollo in that he was the shooter at the Cosmos Space Center</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> When taking or making phone calls, Seiji from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SpiritHunterNG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SpiritHunterNG">Spirit Hunter: NG</a></em> has a noted habit of stepping away from others, since said calls are usually of a morally dubious nature that he doesn't want to be overheard.
