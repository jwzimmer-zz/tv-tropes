In truth, he had already considered her a lost cause and was just humoring Beta. Turns out that direction was actually the location of the Diabolos cult base where Claire was held captive.

The apples from their garden would have been useless anyway, but meeting the mysterious old lady who wants to know what's in their basket, and giving her a snippish "Penises!" (your bowdlerization may vary) was an especially bad move. One guess what's in their basket when they arrive at the castle and how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">screwed</a> they are afterwards.

An agent of the Mesan Alignment informs resistance movements on a few planets currently being oppressed by the Solarian Office of Frontier Security that he's managed to get them support from the Star Empire of Manticore. The plan is that when they launch their uprisings, and the Manticorans fail to show up, the uprisings will be crushed along with Manticore's credibility. Unfortunately for him, the resistance movements manage to get word <em>to</em> the Manticorans. The Manticorans <em>do</em> show up, and not only do the uprisings succeed, but by the end of the novel, OFS has lost an entire sector. What was particularly stupid was that the Mesan agent in question actually told the resistance just how to contact the nearest Manticoran fleet, figuring that their admiral wouldn't move without orders from above. Apparently, he forgot that the RMN has a tradition of officers taking the initiative to launch operations without clearance from above, with the idea that if their superiors disagree, they can disavow what happened. This was rather stupid of him, as one of his previous operations failed in part because a Manticoran captain (Aivars Terekhov) did just that, and came out with a promotion and a knighthood.

You're still right, but explaining the double-switch is a problem.
