The hero or heroine of the series lives through his or her own version of Ebenezer Scrooge's Christmastime visitations from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em>.
</p><p>Comparable only to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em> as a well-known story which a series adapts to/parodies with its own characters. The original was by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesDickens">Charles Dickens</a>: it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">published in 1843</a>. When used in TV shows, characters from the show frequently fill the roles of the ghosts: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyWarning">Marley</a>, who serves to announce that the other ghosts are coming and serve as an illustration of the eventual fate of Scrooge's soul; the Ghost of Christmas Past, who shows the Scrooge character "You weren't always this way" (in which case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHatePastMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHatePastMe">I Hate Past Me</a> is common); The Ghost of Christmas Present, who shows them "Other people aren't this way"; and the Ghost of Christmas Future ("Yet to Come" in Dickens' original, often portrayed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Grim Reaper</a>), who shows the character "This is how things will turn out if you stay this way" (which can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureMeScaresMe">Future Me Scares Me</a>). Results in the character having a change of heart and turning away from whatever character flaw was being explored.

Expect one of these underlings to be a stand-in for Bob Cratchit. Bob Cratchit's counterpart is always a sympathetic character who bears the brunt of whatever bad the protagonist dishes out and takes it exceptionally well. Once we have these two roles filled and established, the audience can then wait with bated breath to find out who is standing in for Tiny Tim. Like the original Tiny Tim, the stand-in might be related to our version of Bob Cratchit, but doesn't have to be. However, you can reasonably expect him or her to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationallyDisadvantaged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationallyDisadvantaged">Inspirationally Disadvantaged</a>, poor, or otherwise so needy that he or she is automatically sympathy bait for the audience. Whichever way the Tiny Tim is in need, the protagonist is in a position to do something about it, but won't, or else has prevented him or her from receiving assistance, and it <em>will</em> be brought up to remind our Scrooge as well as the audience what a bastard he or she is.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Almost invariably (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a>'s Christmas Carol</em> for an exception) results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>. What Aesop is learned can depend, however. In the original <em>Christmas Carol</em> it was Scrooge being forced to confront what he had lost, and what the consequences of his current actions are and would be, that awakened the Christmas Spirit within him. Furthermore, the original had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">generally horrible person</a> Aesopped into decency, whereas some adaptations have resulted in a bizarre "You will be merry or else" lesson, where a character who simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrinch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrinch">doesn't like Christmas</a> is taught the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">error of their ways</a>. After all, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Scrooge</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitlerAteSugar">hated Christmas</a>... Also look out for adaptations missing the point of the emphasis on Scrooge's grave during the future sequence- the point is not "Shape up or you will die" (so being nice makes you immortal?), but rather "Shape up or, when you die, nobody will mourn you."
</p><p>In shows with established casts, a character often has to be handed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall">Conflict Ball</a> to make them abruptly meaner at Christmas, sometimes for no apparent reason; otherwise the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">Aesop</a> wouldn't make any sense. Alternately, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> character may learn a holiday lesson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">only to go right back to their old ways</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">in the next episode</a>. When this results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>, it can overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong">The Complainer Is Always Wrong</a>.
</p><p>Usually these are a type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, although sometimes a variation is employed that has nothing to do with the holiday season. It's also a very popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanfic">Fanfiction</a> trope, with most shows having at least one such plot in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWork">Fan Work</a>.
</p><p>Similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a>, but bound by the specific narrative structure of the Dickens novel.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em>:
<ul><li> A story collected in the 'Haunted Knight' trade sets the story at Halloween and casts Batman himself in the Scrooge role, his father as Jacob Marley, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PoisonIvy">Poison Ivy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>, and his own cowl-clad skeleton as the ghosts, to teach him a lesson about not sacrificing his Bruce Wayne life for his Batman life. It's ambiguous whether he was really visited by spirits brought about by a pendant owned by Lucius Fox, or some bad shrimp he ate at a Halloween party gave him nightmares.
</li><li> <em>Batman: Noel</em>. Once again, Batman is the Scrooge of the story, having lost his faith in humanity and taking some less-than-moral measures in his fight against crime. A vision of Jason Todd (the second Robin) serves as the "Jacob Marley", while the "ghosts" of the story are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Catwoman">Catwoman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> and the Joker as Past, Present and Future respectively.

The spirits almost succeed when they show him the future, where he's grown old and the Freedom Fighters still oppose him, until he sees he wins the final battle (even though he's destroyed everything else, and he ends up getting blown up by a bomb Sonic sent back to him in the present earlier, rendering his victory fruitless and short-lived).
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> comic did <a class="urllink" href="http://jeffoverturf.blogspot.com/2010/12/teen-titans-swingin-christmas-carol-tt.html">an issue<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> entitled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">A Swinging Christmas Carol</a>," involving a stingy junkyard owner, junk smugglers, and a young boy in need of a motorized wheelchair. The Titans work out what's going on halfway through and, entirely undisturbed, take the opportunity to play the ghosts.
</li><li> One spoof story from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichieRich">Richie Rich</a></em> comics featured "Jackie Jokers the boy comedian" as "Eversneezer Scroogie". In the end, he only "reforms" because the Ghost of Christmas Future shows him that Bob Cratchit borrowed money, started a rival business and drove "Scroogie" out of business, so he ends up a penniless beggar. The final punchline however is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the whole thing was staged by actors using special effects, and hired by Bob Cratchit</span>.

Paige, as the ghost of Christmas Past, is more concerned with herself than Jason (at one point showing him a Christmas before his own birth and crying "See how happy I was?!"). Peter, as ghost of Christmas Present, doesn't know what he should do due to only skimming the Cliffs Notes, and ate the feast associated with the traditional depiction of the spirit, remarking "I had (burp) a light lunch, OK?" Marcus, as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyNames">Jacob Marcusly</a>," gets weighed down with "the cables of the many video game controllers I selfishly clung to in life."

Quincy the iguana is an unspeaking ghost of Christmas Future; when he shows Jason his tombstone Jason freaks out because he died the day before the new <em>Star Wars</em> movie came out, and wakes up joyous at the fact that it's a school day.

After looking at the characters' tragic pasts and lonely presents, Vlad shows each their current futures; Bonnie is a drug-addicted model being abused by her manager (and a girl she would have been Secret Santa for in the present as part of a school initiative committed suicide because nobody reached out to her), Red-X dies and his long-lost sister is killed by criminals as 'payback' for his own actions, Vicky is homeless on the streets because she never applied herself to anything while relying on fear, and Valerie is so consumed by her fixation on ghost-hunting that she has no social life and hasn't even acknowledged that her father died a few months before the scene shown to her. After Danny and Vlad return to the human world, Clockwork shows Youngblood the results of their intervention; Bonnie begins trying to reach out to her family and gives the orphan girl her old teddy for emotional support, Red-X makes contact with his sister and begins a silent career as an anti-hero figure, Vicky starts apologising to others for her past treatment of them, and Valerie decides to focus more on maintaining her social life rather than focusing on hunting.

Stage 2: a ghost who's pure black and wearing chains made of assorted kinds of trash shows him the same area in present day, now utterly ruined by human waste and carelessness; Rick bitterly calls him "The Ghost of the Polluted Present" and restates that it's pointless to try to change things. And then Stage 3 kicks in with a ghost who, while not as pristine as the first, is a soft white with hints of green and shows Rick the area cleaned up by human action; Rick realizes that this ghost represents the Hopeful Future and awakens revitalized in his environmental protection actions.

The ghost of the recently deceased Natalie Buxton returned to Larkhall to teach Sylvia Hollamby the error of her ways by taking her through her past, present and not-so-pleasant future. By the end of the episode (and therefore, the series), Sylvia had finally turned over a new leaf, after 8 whole seasons of being a ruthless bitch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em> presented a Christmas special based on Dickens' original story — the twist being that the main character, Ebenezer Blackadder, started out as the nicest man in England and, following an inadvertent tour through his ancestral history and future, was inspired by the exploits of his namesakes (as well as a not very pleasant vision of what his descendants will become if he remains nice) to become a ruthless bastard instead.

</li><li> The Catalan sports comedy show <em>Crackovia</em> had a Christmas Carol-like story featuring Real Madrid chairman Florentino Pérez in the role of Scrooge, by caring only about money and driving away anyone who celebrated Christmas by giving them money. In his sleep, he's visited by José Mourinho, Josep Guardiola and Josep Pedrerol as the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet To Come, to teach him that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">only caring about money</a> would bring Real Madrid to its doom. Mourinho shows Florentino how he bribed schoolmates when he was young; Guardiola brings him to F.C.

Freddie is unable to go home to Arizona for Christmas, and all of her other friends have plans, so she asks Whitley if she could spend the holiday break with her. Whitley is very nasty towards Freddie and tells her no. Cue the ghosts. Marley is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her mother</span>. Christmas Past (Mr. Gaines) shows Whitley that she was a child who was given everything except her parents' attention. Christmas Present (Walter) shows her how mean she really is to everyone. Christmas Future (Jaleesa) shows her that she is dead and that everyone is in attendance for her funeral. Most notably, Dwayne and Freddie are happily married with 6 kids. The ghost explains to Whitley that when she refused to let Freddie go home with her, Dwayne took her home with him and they fell in love soon after. Dwayne gives the eulogy and explains that he cared about Whitley, but she died alone because she pushed everyone away with her horrible attitude. In the end, it appears that she's learned her lesson and tells Freddie that she's welcome at her house, but it's really because she does not want Freddie around Dwayne.

Instead, she's lonely spending her first Christmas away from her family and depressed over the recent death of a patient, named Marley. A character who died early in the series comes to serve as all three Ghosts. In contrast to other adaptations, the vision of the future is quite happy, showing her married with children and grandchildren, though she is left in the dark about who her husband will be. She recovers in time to celebrate the holiday and assist a young woman in giving birth—in a stable, of course.
</li><li> Perhaps surprisingly, the 2008 Christmas Eve episode of UK soap <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eastenders">Eastenders</a></em> had a slightly subtle Christmas Carol. Ian Beale played the part of Scrooge, with various other cast playing the roles of past, present, and future. While the episode played out with the usual 'realism' of the soap, the various 'spirits' made pretty rapid stage exits the moment Ian's back was turned at the end of the scene to clue in any viewers who may have been a bit slow on the uptake.

</li><li> This trope is used in the Christmas episode of the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em>, when Alex P. Keaton views the holiday season as "a silly sentimental farce" - and only has money on his mind. After he goes to bed, The Ghost of Christmas Past appears as his youngest sister, Jennifer. She takes Alex back in time by ten years, and shows him how much he used to love Christmas. Then The Ghost of Christmas Future appears to him as his older younger sister, Mallory. She takes Alex forward in time by thirty years, and shows him how the Keaton family have fallen on hard times - and became extremely poor. Alex did end up becoming rich, but is also fat and balding. While Alex is horrified by his balding head, he is also stunned and horrified by how callous his older self became. When he wakes up, he goes out to buy presents for his family - but he couldn't buy very many presents. It's interesting to note that this episode has some parallels to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>, which Michael J.

</li><li> The British series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle">Hustle</a></em> had a non-mystical version, focusing on their mark receiving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacDissonance">Amnesiac Dissonance</a>, and reforming as a result, making the protagonists uncomfortable with conning him. This was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, and like Dickens' original story, evoked sympathy for the hard-hearted businessman character by explaining how he had become this way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Martin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Martin">Martin</a></em> had the aptly-named episode "Scrooge", where Martin learned the true meaning of Christmas.

</li><li> Perhaps one of the earliest televised versions comes from an episode of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePaulWinchellShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePaulWinchellShow">The Paul Winchell Show</a></em> from the early 1950s, where Paul and his dummy Jerry Mahoney experience trips to both Christmas Past &amp; Christmas Future. The Future glimpse is a vintage example of early science-fiction visions, with metallic space suits and the like.
</li><li> The first season Christmas episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Popular" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Popular">Popular</a></em>. It played more as a tragedy exposing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">not-so-happy past</a> of the series's lead villain.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RadioActive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RadioActive">Radio Active</a></em> had an episode in which the students plan to use this to convince Ms. Atoll not to give them homework over the holidays. She survives their rather pathetic versions of the ghosts' visits - including a past in which she was black - only to wake and realize it was all a dream. When the students show up to start their plot she immediately takes back the assignments so she doesn't have to go through it again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> had the title character deciding to give up on Halloween pranks — and being visited by the ghosts of Halloween past, Halloween Present, and Halloween Future. They show that if she gives up the pranks, she'll turn into her mother (literally).
</li><li> The Nickelodeon sketch comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roundhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roundhouse">Roundhouse</a></em> spoofed this in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> with the Ghosts of Christmas Specials, who had to quickly lead the dad through the usual setup due to a scheduled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell">Saved by the Bell</a></em> appearance later.

</li><li> The fifth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon">Sanford and Son</a></em> featured an episode "Ebenezer Scrooge" which included the exchange:

The ghost in this version is the apparent ghost of his mother and Luthor sees a future where he's given up on ambition and lives a happy life with Lana. The lesson that he takes from this is that he should be ruthless, because in this good future Lana dies in childbirth, because Lex, having rejected his evil father, can't get help from him that might save her. On a larger scale, he declares that this doesn't just apply to Lana dying in childbirth, but also to everything in his life. He declares that he wants more money and more power, saying that "See, once you have those two things, you can <em>secure</em> everything else." Thus, Lex's status as the antithesis to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> begins. As a result of this deliberately dark ending and the way it sets up Superman lore, this episode was probably one of the few Christmas Carol remakes that can actually be called epic.
</li><li> The episode "Homecoming" also can be seen as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> variation, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">a reformed Brainiac</a> (now calling himself Brainiac 5 and an active member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>) showing Clark his past, present, and future in order to help him deal with his own personal demons and become the hero he's destined to be. Unlike most versions of <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, Clark's future is positive; he embraces the identity of Superman, is a successful reporter for the Planet and has Lois as a partner, confidante and lover. Also, his vision isn't a dream; his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFutureSelfAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyFutureSelfAndMe">future self</a> even recalls his past self's arrival in the future and gets him to rescue Lois while he himself prevents a nuclear reactor from melting down. (The episode got extra points for bringing back the actor who played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SmallvilleS01E02Metamorphosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SmallvilleS01E02Metamorphosis">Bug Boy</a>, Clark's first post-pilot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Freak of the Week</a>.)

Rocky plays both Marley and a combination of all three ghosts called "Ghost of Christmas Dance" showing Cece not only the reason behind the breakup but how much Georgea loves Jeremy and how miserable her life would become without him. Cece <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">finally realizes her mistake</a> and makes things right between her mother and Jeremy.

It featured London's talking mirror as not only the Marley but the one to show her the Past, Present, and Future. She learns less to stop hating Christmas and more to stop being so selfish about it (she's probably wealthy enough to buy a small country, but refused to spend a cent even on her closest friends).

</li><li> Also, in "Grift of the Magi," Mr Burns is visited by three ghosts on Christmas and decides to fund the elementary school. The gag is that it happens completely offscreen, and is only mentioned briefly during a montage in which we hear about various cliched Christmas plotlines which supporting characters experienced that year. ("And Moe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAWonderfulPlot">having been shown what the world would be like if he'd never been born</a>, took his head out of the oven and replaced it with a plump Christmas goose.")

Mr. Herriman, despite knowing the story better than Bloo, actually manages to get the "ghost's" message wrong and cancels Christmas instead. Hilariously, during the closing credits after Christmas has been saved, Herriman prays to the ghosts to spare him, and that he will try to cancel Christmas next year. To be fair, it wasn't entirely Herriman's fault; the way Bloo worded his message could have been taken either way. He said "not one present," which could be mistaken as meaning "not even one present." Let's not forget that Bloo's Ghost of Christmas Future is a robot. Mac lampshades the ridiculousness of this when he hears the story.

Mr. Spacely was even given a deceased business partner named Jacob <em>Marsley</em>. Mr. Spacely only decided to make nice out of self-interest, however. You see, since Astro had become ill from choking on a Spacely Sprocket, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come showed Mr. Spacely a future where the Jetsons had successfully sued him and gotten all his money. Of course, that's the only thing the Jetsons could sue him for. The origin of the plot was lampshaded when George, complaining about Spacely, commented that Scrooge was nice in comparison and that Spacely would end up scaring the ghosts away.

</li><li> A variation on the theme appears in the Christmas episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BackToTheFutureTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BackToTheFutureTheAnimatedSeries">Back to the Future: The Animated Series</a></em>, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BackToTheFutureTheAnimatedSeriesS1E10DickensOfAChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BackToTheFutureTheAnimatedSeriesS1E10DickensOfAChristmas">Dickens of a Christmas</a>", where Doc and family, plus Marty, travel back to 19th century England during Christmastime to escape some nasty summer heat. One of the B plots of the episode features Ebiffneezer Tannen, who forecloses on the owners of a toy shop the main characters met in the beginning and sends them to debtors' prison. Clara, who was in the shop at the time and refused Ebiffneezer's advances, is sent too. Marty, attempting to break Clara out, is told Ebiffneezer is a real "Scrooge," which inspires him to pull the Ghost act on the Tannen. Ebiffneezer is a hard sell, though — even after seeing stuff that "would make the Terminator cry," he refuses to change. It's only through Marty dropping and accidentally activating a projection movie system that he was watching on his hoverboard at the beginning of the episode that Ebiffneezer is inspired to change — the Tannen is terrified by the Godzilla movie and swears to be good. The episode may be unique in having the lesson also not STICK — Ebiffneezer reverts near-immediately to his nasty self once he sees Marty at the end and realizes he's not a ghost. There's an amusing bit of lampshading when Marty first appears as the ghost — Ebiffneezer asks him if he's "Past, Present, or Future," and Marty, being a time traveler, admits to being all three.

The three ghosts (or goats, when George misunderstands the word) then attempt to show George how horrible his life will be unless he <em>stops</em> celebrating Christmas. Additionally, since it was George's first Christmas, the "Goat" of Christmas Past is forced to make up a past Christmas from scratch.

The superhero of the comic book Rocko kept ordering Filburt to sell showed up to remind Rocko of how Rocko and Filburt used to be friends. Then he showed Rocko what the future will be if he doesn't repent. Rocko saw himself in the future mistreating a customer the same way Rocko's boss did at the beginning of the episode. Rocko and Filburt restored their friendship. However, when Rocko's boss returned, he ordered Rocko to fire Filburt since Rocko would be the only needed employee again. Rocko refused to fire Filburt, so his boss fired the both of them.

This time the Scrooge who gets the ghostly visits is a bossy Victorian theater owner/diva named Eden Starling (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">whose initials just happen to be "E.S."</a>). Interestingly, every major role goes through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a>—Jacob Marley is instead Eden's vain aunt (bound in mirrors instead of cashboxes) who raised her to shun the holiday, all three Spirits are women of different ages (which makes for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> Christmas Yet to Come especially), the Tiny Tim character (played by Kelly<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ow7g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ow7g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ow7g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Now known today as Chelsea.</span>) is a poor orphan girl (complete with crutch!), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">pretty much every other role</a> is combined into Eden's assistant Catherine. Also, rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> showing Eden dead, this version depicts her as a broke has-been, while Catherine, originally kind and sweet, has become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> herself.

This one presents the Ghosts of Christmas Past as a floating candlestick and Future as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShadow">Living Shadow</a> closer to their book's descriptions. It is a very faithful adaptation, up to the Ghosts' designs, an extended sequence of Scrooge being shrunk, and the chase scene with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. The weird thing is that it's trying to be a comedy at the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>:
<ul><li> 1979's <em>Bugs Bunny's Christmas Carol</em> was an ultra-condensed adaptation from the half hour Christmas special ''Bugs Bunny's Looney Christmas Tales. This riffed on the story with Yosemite Sam as Scrooge, Porky Pig as Cratchit, Tweety as Tiny Tim, and Bugs Bunny as a Fred Scrooge analogue who dresses up as a ghost to scare Sam straight. Much looser an adaptation than even most of the other works on this page, as there's only one ghost, he's a fake, he spends much of the cartoon simply spooking Sam with loud noises and ice cold bathtubs, and in the end gets him to change his ways by simply threatening him with a trip "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">down there</a>." Of course, it's an eight-minute short, adapting the whole story would probably have been impossible. In the special's framing sequences, Yosemite states he was just acting and that he's still greedy and then starts to get back everything he donated.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bugs:</strong> I'm going to take you to the man in the red suit. <br/><strong>Yosemite Sam:</strong> You mean Santy Claus? <br/><strong>Bugs:</strong> No, the OTHER man in the red suit.
</div></li><li> <em>Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas Special</em> is a 2006 animated straight-to-DVD movie starring the Looney Tunes characters. Granted, the story takes place in modern times (a Walmart-esque department store) instead of the traditional Victorian setting, but it follows the same formula, with Daffy in the role of Scrooge who makes "Bah, Humduck!" his catchphrase for the special. Sylvester is Marley. Granny, Yosemite Sam and the Tasmanian Devil are Past, Present and Yet To Come, Porky Pig is Bob Cratchit again (with his daughter Priscilla as Tiny Tim) and Bugs is sort of Fred as the character who refuses to let Daffy's cynicism get him down.
</li></ul></li><li> BKN's direct-to-DVD adaptation made the characters talking animals. Tiny Tim doesn't die in the Christmas Future segment, but instead grows up to be a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> who is exactly like Scrooge in every way, except while Scrooge was swimming in wealth and healthy in his old age, elderly Tiny Tim was broke and permanently crippled, causing Scrooge to not only see what he himself was, but also horrified that this child's innocence and promising future was destroyed because of his own greed.

Like the Disney version above, this was a semi-straight adaptation of the book rather than a use of its plot on an extant character. While many of the book's characters are played by established Muppets, the three spirits are original character designs in line with Dickens' descriptions. Originally they were going to use already established Muppets for the Ghosts, as in a Muppet book adaptation, but decided it would detract from the mysterious air they were supposed to have. While Miss Piggy and Gonzo (the first and third spirits) had their roles reassigned, Scooter—who would have played the second spirit—ended up not appearing at all.

</li><li> <em>Karroll's Christmas</em>, a made-for-TV comedy, puts a spin on the story by having the ghosts visit the wrong house due to an apparent clerical error.

They proceed to show Allen Rosecog's past, present, and future, and he realizes how much he can relate to the man. Afterward Allen proceeds to try to change his neighbor for the better himself. It works, and it's implied the ghosts didn't make a mistake after all.

Two out of three ghosts were people Eddie knew - the Ghost of Christmas Past was his dead father, and the Ghost of Christmas Present was also Jacob Marley. The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come wasn't someone Eddie knew <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because the "ghost" was someone not even born yet - he's the son Eddie could have if he reforms</span>.

This one should get special notice because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble">Relationship Writing Fumble</a>—Ebbie has better chemistry with Marley than with her lost past love. It's also one of few adaptations to feature the Scrooge character forced to watch both their sister and Marley die by the Ghost of Christmas Past (also shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scrooge1951" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scrooge1951"> Scrooge (1951)</a></em>) and witness their own death in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> (also shown in two other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> tv versions, <em>Ms. Scrooge</em> and <em>A Carol Christmas</em>, as well as the 1998 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">Wild West</a> retelling <em>Film/Ebenezer</em>.)

This Scrooge does have Christmas dinner—with his friend the madam of the local whorehouse. Marley is his old business partner Marlowe, Christmas Past is a First Nations woman, Christmas Present a Mountie, and Christmas Future is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ebenezer's long-dead father</span>. This version adds Sam Benson, a young rancher Ebenezer cheats out of his land before he could wed Marlowe's daughter Erica. The future scenes are expanded to show Scrooge ruthlessly gunning Benson down at high noon and dying while attempting to stop Erica from revealing how he cheated.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a> TV movie <em>Ms. Scrooge</em> features Cicely Tyson as "Ebenita Scrooge." This version features the character's past trauma as watching her father die in a fire, and in an uncommon trope for these remakes, Ebenita is actually made to watch her future self die. Also, instead of begging for another chance for herself, she asks that even if she can't change her own horrible fate, at least let her help Tim Cratchit.
</li><li> Hallmark Channel had one called <em>A Carol Christmas</em> in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210">Tori Spelling</a> plays a selfish trash talk show host.

Holmes deduces the entirety of the man's life except his name. This includes a hard childhood, a generous sponsor, a kindness towards children, and a loving wife. The doctor says it was his godfather who changed his life by aiding him in education and hospital visits though not before his godfather was converted following his claim that he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">could see see dead people</span>.

Rather than having Vegeta undergo a complete personality 180 like Scrooge, the story simply tries to explain why he chose to stick around on Earth after Freeza's defeat. Over the course of the story the Ghosts (played by Nappa, Bulma, Goku and even Freeza himself) show Vegeta that he <em>does</em> care about companionship no matter how fiercely he pretends otherwise, and that if he continues being a standoffish loner all he'd get would be an unmarked grave on some remote planet.

</li><li> <em>Hating Valentine's Day</em> is a romantic comedy version.
</li><li> The Christmas Edition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh">Sweet Valley Twins</a>, in which Jessica has been pulling numerous selfish stunts, most recently, sabotaging a celebrity lunch that her twin sister ELIZABETH was meant to have in order to garner said celebrity's support for a charity (Jessica could care less about the charity, she just wants to meet a celebrity). So she's not shunning Christmas, but is instead, completely focused on her own happiness and no one else's. While there's no Marley character, three ghosts are present. Christmas Past — shows how Jessica used to love sharing her toys and clothes with her sister. Christmas Present — shows how Jessica has become selfish and estranged from her sister. Christmas Future, who in true Dickens style, is a ghostly, shrouded figure—fast forwards to a teenage Jessica and Elizabeth. Jessica is unpopular and loathed by nearly everyone because of her cruelty and selfishness. Of course, she wakes up determined to change for the better.
</li><li> SFWA writer P. Andrew Miller's short story, "The Dude who Did in Dickens," is about a time-traveler so sick of <em>Christmas Carol</em> remakes that he goes back in time to kill Dickens before the story is written. Unfortunately, this just makes matters worse.

</li><li> A children's book, <em>Hanukkah, Schmannukah!</em> uses the basic storyline to show a Jewish guy named Scroogemacher (oy) the error of his ways. Interestingly, the three ghosts can be read as Orthodox Judaism (Hanukkah Past shows the history of the holiday), Conservative Judaism (Hanukkah Present looks at Scroogemacher's workers in turn-of-the-20th-century New York City), and Reform Judaism (Hanukkah Future is a <em>black woman</em>, and shows how even interfaith families can observe the traditions).

When the ghost of Marley appears, Linkara shoots at him and points out that there's no need to do a <em>Christmas Carol</em> episode, since he already loves Christmas (and comic books), but Marley says the Spirits are already booked. They show up periodically throughout the review, but he quickly dismisses them.

So she resolves to gain a social life. For the sake of becoming stronger.
