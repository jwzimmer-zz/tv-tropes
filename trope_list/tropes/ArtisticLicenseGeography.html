This form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">Artistic License</a> can happen in a number of ways. The most common seems to be setting a story in a particular city without consulting a map, thus placing locations that are nowhere near one another quite close by, underestimating the time it would take to get from one to another, and sometimes transplanting whole landmarks from somewhere else entirely.

</li><li> An ad for the U.S. Postal Service tying in with the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> 2</em> showed Spidey picking up a package at the main post office in Manhattan, swinging past the Queensboro Bridge, and delivering the package to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">a man</a> at the Ziegfeld Theater. Except the bridge is north and east of both locations — quite a bit east, in fact, as in the other side of Manhattan.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">1980s</a>, in a year when the World Science Fiction Convention was held in Brighton in Sussex, the announcement of it in magazines claimed Brighton to be "near London". Maybe it's because Britain is smaller than the USA, or because it has a higher population density (especially in Southern England), but the British don't regard a place 60 miles away as "near".

<ul><li> Actually, Koro-Sensei from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em> passed the Philippines the first time he crossed the world in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULWGpwuLbJ0">his drawing song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's Indonesia he crossed when crossing back to Dubai. This inaccuracy only exists in the anime adaptation.
</li><li> In S1E31 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakutenShootBeyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BakutenShootBeyblade">Bakuten Shoot Beyblade</a></em> series, the main characters are ditched in Southampton, England, on their way to Russia for a tournament battle. As the ship pulls into harbour, Southampton appears to have green mountains and picturesque brick houses. It's actually a large modern city and its docks are flat slabs of concrete far as the eye can see. Definitely no mountains. The show redeems itself only a little, relying mostly on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">Willing Suspension of Disbelief</a>. The scene suddenly jumps from Southampton to London, which means a distance of eighty miles. Kenny has previously mentioned that they have no money, and it's not said whether they walked, hitchhiked or anything else. However, their arrival on foot does suggest that they walked. Yet the sky is still bright when they get there, and the only thing to suggest that Southampton is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritainIsOnlyLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritainIsOnlyLondon">right next door to London</a> is Kenny's (vague) comment that seeing Big Ben reminds him of how much time they've lost.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em> went for the climate. At one point in the series, when Red Shield ship came to Vladivostok, the heroes transferred to a train. Among them, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMinority">Lewis</a> wore a hat. In the middle of the winter. Apparently, nobody told the authors that the winds at the time could lift an adult man off the ground, and temperatures routinely reached -25C (-13F) with precipitation of 400mm or 32 inches. You'd be lucky if you end up with <em>only</em> frostbitten ears in such conditions.
<ul><li> In one episode in Vietnam, Kai <em>walked</em> from Hanoi to a port and back in a day. Firstly, if you look at the map, Hanoi has no port, the nearest one from there is in Hai Phong, which takes 4 hours to travel by car (assuming it doesn't cross the speed limit), and another 4 hours to go back, and somehow Kai traveled back and forth between the 2 places on foot... in a day... before the sunset. And no, Kai is a human character in this vampire series, and for the vampire characters, only the Schiff variants have sonic speed power.
</li><li> Averted, though, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a> 2</em>, where they <em>did</em> do the research. Sure, the weather was shown to be a bit too balmy for a season, but warm spells <em>do</em> tend to happen around New Year and everything else was spot on.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> The most common one is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a> scene from the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>: although the city is said to be Sydney, Australia, the location that's shown is quite clearly New York (the Brooklyn Bridge is visible in the foreground, while what looks like the World Trade Center can be seen in the distance). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a></em> re-creates the scene, and this time gets the city's look right (including the iconic Opera House).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0080WarInThePocket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0080WarInThePocket">Gundam 0080</a></em>; Bernie, disguised as an enemy soldier and claiming to be from Australia, talks about how much it would snow in December. Minutes later, the soldier to whom he was speaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">realizes</a> that the Southern Hemisphere is in the middle of <em>summertime</em> in December, exposing Bernie as a spy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>, <a class="urllink" href="http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20101222063227/gundam/images/a/af/AmeriaMap.png">this map<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> places the Mountain Cycle near West Virginia and Vicinity Town in central Jersey. In the show, a group of teenagers is able to <em>walk</em> between the two locations in less than twelve hours. (Not even walking fast, either.) In general, the pace of movement between locations is far quicker than one would expect by looking at the map. In fact, the map actually makes much of the plot for the first half of the series nonsensical - the territory that the Diana Counter wants to colonize and are trying to negotiate for the right to settle in and the region they've landed in and whose leaders they are negotiating with are in totally different countries.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shinzo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shinzo">Shinzo</a></em> takes place 300 years in the future; apparently, geography has changed until New York is nowhere near an ocean and the Statue of Liberty is partially buried by the land. At the same time, Egypt is entirely covered by ocean, and you can reach it in half a day starting from the Alps while moving in a vehicle that goes about 30 miles per hour.
</li><li> Assuming Neo Domino City in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> is in Japan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">(and it probably is)</a> the Crashtown Arc makes very little sense. Crashtown, which seems to fall under the jurisdiction of Sector Security (seeing as they showed up to arrest the villains in the end) is a town resembling an Old West mining town in a desert resembling the American southwest, and there simply aren't any places like that in Japan.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>. New Zealand is a massive desert filled with monsters, which Excel kills and sells their pelts in order to get back to Japan. It could be the usual mistake of thinking New Zealand is Australia.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Rosette's journey from NYC to San Francisco to rescue her brother goes as follows: She takes a pilgrimage to the time-frozen Seventh Bell Orphanage in Michigan. From there she drives to Washington DC (roughly 500 miles the wrong way), where Satella destroys her car. Then she takes a train to Chicago (which gets hijacked and wrecked). From there, her superiors get tired of all the accidental destruction and charter a plane to take her directly to California. Since this rescue mission was the most important thing on Rosette's mind for the four years leading up to this trip, there are only two possible explanations for such a roundabout route: Either the mangaka forgot to plot the journey out on a map, or Rosette is incapable of cross-country navigation. Even with the story taking place 30 years before the creation of the interstate highway system, there <em>had</em> to be a more direct route than that.
</li><li> The novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADogOfFlanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADogOfFlanders">A Dog of Flanders</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">very popular in Japan</a>. This led to many anime adaptations of the story. Even though the story takes place in Antwerp, Belgium, some of these films depict the country in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfTulipsAndWindmills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfTulipsAndWindmills">a stereotypical version of a neighbouring country</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">The Netherlands</a>, complete with boys and girls on clogs walking in tulip fields.
</li><li> The ROD <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation">OVAs</a> start with a shot of the rolling, forested hills of Washington DC. The city was built in a filled-in swamp and has little greenery outside parks and the Potomac waterfront. It actually looks much more like Alexandria (which used to be part of DC and is across the Potomac) than DC proper.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em>, a sign shows the Kansas/Washington D.C. border. No points for figuring out the problem with that.

However, in "Heavenly Fireworks", Weather journeys on foot to Ayers Rock to research the likelihood of a spectacular meteor shower, a journey which appears to take a day at most. The Breadknife and Ayers Rock are over 1,000 miles apart, so to make that journey on foot would take over a month; the writers evidently decided to set the distance aside in the interest of having an excuse to depict Ayers Rock's visual splendour.

Possibly justified in that most of the old buildings in the movie's 2019 L.A. seem to have been given major vertical extensions, and the fact that it is a very cool-looking roof line.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, two ferries connect Michigan to Wisconsin across Lake Michigan: the S.S. Badger, which connects U.S. 10 from Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to Ludington, Michigan, and the Lake Express, connecting Milwaukee to Muskegon, Michigan. The latter (which only opened in 2004) is as close to a Detroit-to-Racine connection as you can get... <em>if</em> you consider that, plus three hours on westbound Interstate 96 and about 45 minutes on southbound SR-32 "close". Racine doesn't even have a dock that can handle a vessel of the size a ferry like that would be likely to be, and that it's a BC Ferry they're riding, from Tsawwassen (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vancouver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Vancouver">Vancouver</a>) to Swartz Bay (Victoria).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay">Independence Day</a></em>:
<ul><li> One of the alien saucer ships is parked above downtown Los Angeles, but Randy Quaid can see it from Imperial County? Yeah, okay, they're only <em>200 miles</em> apart. They also conveniently ignored the existence of the counties of San Diego, Orange, and Riverside, three major and about fifty minor cities, and five mountain ranges in the way. Even if he lived in Palmdale, which is actually in Los Angeles County, he still wouldn't be able to see it.
</li><li> Apparently, the aliens parked over LA, decided to move, got lost, and wound up over San Diego County's Laguna Mountains before they checked their map. The exterior shot of the trailer park shows the eastern slopes of the Laguna Mountains, and the ship appears to be centered above the tiny mountain town of Pine Valley (population 800), which is far, <em>far</em> away from Los Angeles. This really fails when the establishing shot of Will Smith outside his house <em>in LA</em> shows it <em>farther</em> away than the establishing shot of Quaid's trailer park.
</li><li> The "top-secret, not marked on any map" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51">Area 51</a> is both well-known and clearly marked on any map of central Nevada. Area 51 is Groom Lake Airfield, just one of the many widely-scattered facilities that make up the Nellis Air Force Base complex. You can see it from the perimeter fence, and <em>everybody and their dog</em> knows where it is. The movie shows it in the middle of an enormous salt flat with mountains on the horizon. The real one is indeed right next to a dry lake bed, but it's much smaller and the mountains are much closer. The Area 51 exteriors were shot around Edwards Air Force Base, in the western Mojave Desert of San Bernardino County, California. (along with the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah)
</li><li> MCAS El Toro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">(which was closed a year after the movie was released)</a> is located in a temperate coastal valley in Orange County, California, surrounded by suburbs, with the relatively-verdant Ortega Mountains to the east. It is <em>not</em> in a remote, arid desert surrounded by rocky hills and sparse scrub brush.
</li><li> On the other side of the world, a British commander sends a message to the Americans, telling them that Israel and Syria have prepared air-strike wings to take out one of the alien spaceships. He says the aircraft are being prepared in the <em>Golan Straits</em>. The straits nearest to the Golan <em>Heights</em> are about four hundred miles south, in the Indian Ocean.
</li><li> A news broadcast mentions that one of the ships has arrived over the capital of India, and is illustrated with a map that shows a ship over Bombay<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8hf52');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8hf52" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8hf52');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionalPeriodPiece">it was renamed Mumbai after the film's release</a></span> instead of New Delhi. (The War of 1996 viral site made for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDayResurgence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDayResurgence">the sequel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">does imply that both cities were attacked on the same day at the same time</a>, but it still doesn't add up).
</li><li> Of all people, the designers of the War of 1996 viral site did this five times with different locations:
<ul><li> One of the errors is that Yokohama was destroyed 6 hours after Tokyo: however, given the supposed radius (20 miles) of the spaceships' weapon, Yokohama is far too close to Tokyo to survive the first wave (the two cities are about 17 miles apart). Nagoya and Osaka are given as third wave and fourth wave targets, respectively; with Yokohama gone, Nagoya would more likely have been a second wave target, while Osaka would not even have survived the third wave. More reasonable fourth (i.e. intercepted) wave targets would have been Kyoto, Okayama, Kitakyushu, Niigata, Sendai or even Fukuoka. Hiroshima would be out of the question here as the ship that destroyed Seoul is supposed to have targeted it.
</li><li> The second error: the segment on the reconstruction of the world shows a destroyed Taj Mahal in Agra, India. Agra is over a hundred miles from New Delhi, and none of the ships in South Asia targeted it.
</li><li> The third error is Denver's supposed destruction. NORAD HQ is nowhere near Denver: it is actually in Colorado Springs, over 50 miles away. The wiki for Independence Day (eventually) got this right.
</li><li> The fourth error: Algiers, Algeria (a third wave city) and Casablanca, Morocco (a fourth wave city targeted by the same ship as Algiers). Casablanca is over 600 miles south-west of Algiers, yet the site has it at least 200 miles to the south-east. Also, the site thinks it's a rural desert location instead of a coastal city home to over 3 million people.
</li><li> The fifth error: There is no city called Pingxiang in Hebei province, China. There is a Pingxiang <em>County</em> in that province, but it is administrated by the government of Xingtai City, instead of being independent (most of the major cities in China are treated the same way as prefectures would be). The confusion must have arisen from that fact. The biggest locale in China by the name 'Pingxiang' is in Jiangxi Province, the closet major city to which is Changsha (in nearby Hunan).
</li></ul></li><li> A map of Russia in one news report in the movie shows cities in completely wrong places. Also, Moscow is shown to be covered in snow... in <em>July</em>. (And, for an added bit of fun, the map shown is that of the Soviet Union.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></em> features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaseScene">car chase</a> in Venice, <em>which has no roads.</em> A car chase in Venice is like having a yacht race in the Atacama Desert (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerEbert">Roger Ebert</a> made fun of this faux pas when he reviewed the movie on TV). Venice's canals are apparently also deep enough to accommodate a battlecruiser-sized submarine, and have bridges over them on the sixth floor of the buildings lining the canals, under which said submarine's fuselage (never mind the turret) can fit. There are also cemeteries with below-ground plots—in a city at sea level.
<ul><li> In addition, the climax takes place in Mongolia. The heroes and villains both supposedly reach Mongolia by sea, even though the country is landlocked with no rivers that go anywhere near the Pacific Ocean.
</li></ul></li><li> One scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LooneyTunesBackInAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LooneyTunesBackInAction">Looney Tunes: Back in Action</a></em> has Brendan Fraser chasing a villain leaving the Louvre... and somehow immediately reaching the Eiffel Tower like two seconds later. <a class="urllink" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Musee+du+Louvre+to+Tour+Eiffel">In real life, they're about 4 km apart.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> Amusingly enough, the three main characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeltaFarce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeltaFarce">Delta Farce</a></em> are State Military Reservists sent to Iraq (to the east of the United States) during the Gulf War due to a shortage of manpower, yet they somehow end up in <em>Mexico</em> (directly southwest-ish of the United States). The fact that they were living in the state of Georgia makes it that much more absurd.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OrangeCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OrangeCounty">Orange County</a></em>, Shaun goes to Orange County High School. There is no Orange County High School in California, though Orange County School of the Arts, in Santa Ana, was known as Orange County High School of the Arts until 2012. There is an actual Orange County High School in Virginia.
<ul><li> Shaun's brother tells him he can get him to Stanford University, located in Palo Alto, in three hours. He must really floor it, because driving from So Cal to the Bay Area usually takes twice that long.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfTheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfTheMask">Son of the Mask</a></em> This movie is set ten years after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMask">The Mask</a></em> and in Fringe City, which is 270 miles southwest of Edge City. Stanley Ipkiss tossed the Mask into the ocean at the end of the first movie, and at the start of the second, it's floating in a river toward Fringe City. So, not only did the Mask travel the wrong way up the river, it appears to be moving at about five miles an hour. In ten years it would have moved about 17,520 miles <em>away</em> from the coast. It's even more baffling because the first film ends with both his best friend and his <em>dog</em> jumping into the river to retrieve the Mask.

So where would you end up? Germany! Specifically, Berchtesgaden, where Hitler had his Alpine retreat. Furthermore, the actual Austrian-Swiss border is not mountainous at all, and actually lies along part of the Rhine. The real Von Trapps simply took a train to Italy for "vacation" and never came back; Georg had been born in a part of Austria-Hungary that was ceded to Italy after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, so he and his family could claim Italian citizenship.

Also, the statues depicted were at <em>Abu Simbel</em>, which is at the other end of the country, over a thousand kilometers away.</span>
</li><li> In the movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em>, the scenes supposedly taking place in Arizona are completely inaccurate. It is clear in the book that Bella's house is in Paradise Valley, a highly populated suburb of Phoenix known for its large houses and for being a valley. However, her house in the movie is clearly not in Paradise Valley, especially because it is <em>on a mountain</em>. Also, the scene when the Cullens and Bella are playing baseball there is a view of a tall waterfall. That falls is called Multnomah Falls on the Columbia Gorge. Furthermore, while Forks is 30 miles south of the Canadian border, Multnomah Falls is in Oregon. However, this might simply be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling">Oregon Doubling</a>, since Oregon is cheaper to film in than Washington, and filmmakers figured most viewers wouldn't know the difference.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> franchise makes several errors.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">2007 movie</a> has the characters go from the Hoover Dam in Nevada to what appears to be Los Angeles, California in a short space of time, when in actuality they're about a four and a half hour drive from each other. The film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">handwaves</a> this by referring to it vaguely as Mission City, only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">the sequel</a> to then refer to it as LA without explanation.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersRevengeOfTheFallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></em> acts as though Giza, Aqaba, Petra, and Luxor and their associated landmarks are within an hour or less of each other. Its depiction of Petra suggests that there are driveable roads leading up to Ad-Deir. In actuality, any visitor to Petra has to hike up a long trail (with regular steps) to get to it, unless you want to pay the Bedouins the exorbitant fee they charge to ride a camel or donkey up. The filmmakers also assiduously avoid showing you the rather large snack bar/gift shop complex that's right next to it. Also, the orangy-red desert that is represented as being in Egypt is recognizably <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi_Rum">Wadi Rum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in southern <em>Jordan</em> very close to the Saudi Arabian border.
</li><li> The whole scene where we are introduced to Jetfire is confusing. The opening shot is of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, located in downtown Washington, DC (never mind that the Space Shuttle and Blackbird are located in the Udvar-Hazy Museum, located just off of the Dulles Airport, some 40 miles away!). When Jetfire leaves the hangar/museum, Jetfire and the others find themselves walking around in a rural desert-like area. What happened to downtown DC?????
</li><li> Among its other inconsistencies with its depiction of Hong Kong, apparently <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersAgeOfExtinction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersAgeOfExtinction">Transformers: Age of Extinction</a></em> thinks that there's a suspension bridge connecting Hong Kong Island with Kowloon, when in fact the island is exclusively connected by either ferry or three cross-harbor tunnels. The bridge depicted is actually the Stonecutters Bridge crossing over the Kowloon Container Terminal (something that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">another movie about giant robots fighting in Hong Kong</a> managed to get right, even though that film didn't have any actual street scenes shot on location). Also, the sprawling landscape of Wulong Karst National Park is on Hong Kong Island for some reason, even though it would've probably taken up a quarter of the whole island.
</li><li> A scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersTheLastKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersTheLastKnight">Transformers: The Last Knight</a></em> shows Stonehenge has being isolated. A quick look at Google Maps shows the A303 within 200 metres from the monument. It also shows a character running down an alley in Oxford to get to a library, which is actually in the opposite direction, and also shows a library in London that is actually in Trinity College, Dublin.
</li></ul></li><li> Early in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeerHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeerHunter">The Deer Hunter</a></em>, the characters, who ostensibly live in Western Pennsylvania, go deer hunting in a wilderness where there are many bare-topped, snowcapped peaks, betraying the film's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling">California Doubling</a> (the film was shot in Washington).
</li><li> Bert I. Gordon's giant grasshopper film <em>Beginning of the End</em> is fairly good on Illinois geography, at least on paper. When it comes to filming, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois">who knew Illinois had so many mountains?</a>
</li><li> Cheapo '50s proto-technothriller <em>Radar Secret Service</em> is set in Washington D.C., but looks suspiciously like Southern California. Also, there's apparently a canyon near Washington.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> has a scene that takes place at an oceanfront restaurant in San José, Costa Rica, but San José is inland. The subtitles establishing this had to be redubbed for the film's Caribbean release, but remain uncorrected elsewhere. It also ends with the helicopters flying off from Isla Nublar towards the setting sun — due west out over the Pacific Ocean, where there's no land for thousands of miles...
</li><li> In <em>I am David</em> the titular character escapes from Belene camp (which is shown to be in a mountainous area) simply by running away when the electric fence is shut off. The real Belene camp was on a flat island in the middle of the very wide Danube river and could only be escaped by swimming for the river shore nearly a kilometer away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InnocentBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InnocentBlood">Innocent Blood</a></em> confuses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> geography. A character demands to know how one gets to the neighborhood called Shadyside, whereupon the action cuts to a very recognizable intersection in another part of town entirely. In another scene, characters drive along the same short stretch of highway about seven times, because that's all the highway there is and the makers wanted a longer car chase. In another instance, a vampire drives out of the Fort Pitt Tunnels and sees the sun rising directly in front of him, between two skyscrapers of the city. The Fort Pitt Tunnels empty out in a northeast direction. There's no way the sun could be coming up in front of him. Note the shadows on the traffic don't reflect the sun directly in front, either. During the latter half of the year, the rising sun would shine directly on the Fort Pitt Tunnel exit at a roughly 2 o'clock angle to the direction of traffic.
</li><li> In <em>Oxford Blues</em> the sculling race on the Isis (the Thames in Oxford) is all over the place, if you're familiar with that stretch of river. They even randomly skip to Pangbourne (about 30 miles away by river). The funny thing is that it appears they had enough footage of the right stretch that they could have put the clips together in a realistic order if they'd been bothered.
</li><li> In <em>The Boy In Blue</em>, the river that stands in for The Thames looks like no UK river at all.
</li><li> The John Ritter film from the '70s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Americathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Americathon">Americathon</a></em> (set in the near future) includes an opening montage/narration to get the audience up to speed about what has happened to America. One included bit of information is that "North Dakota has become the first all-gay state." This is accompanied by a picture of Mt. Rushmore, with one of the presidents wearing an earring. Mt. Rushmore is in South Dakota. The same film had Great Britain as the fifty-somethingth state of the United States, and Israel united with its Islamic-state neighbors as the "Hebrab" coalition. Who knows if the Mt. Rushmore reference was this trope, or just another political-merger joke?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMightyDucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMightyDucks">The Mighty Ducks</a></em> movies are set in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwinCities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwinCities">Minneapolis/St. Paul</a> area of Minnesota and frequently feature local geography. Which would be great if it didn't feature 13-year olds rollerblading to locations that are up to 60 miles away from each other in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> (and don't allow rollerblading in the first place).

The only problem? The highest point in Louisiana is only 535 feet (163 m) high, and is nowhere near the swamps. Worse yet: the description on the DVD cover (or at least the one on the Redbox vendor screen) states the movie takes place in <em>Wisconsin</em>, which is four states away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> has Connor and Duncan MacLeod being born in Glen Finnan, but Glen Finnan is not in fact within the MacLeod clan's lands.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeftBehind2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeftBehind2000">Left Behind</a></em>:
<ul><li> A shot labeled "Israeli-Syrian Border" and shows tanks driving over desert. The border of Israel and Syria, which is called the Golan Heights, is actually green and mountainous (and is a subject of dispute partially for this very reason).
</li><li> The film opens with a shot of Jerusalem, with the <em>morning</em> sun glinting off the <em>eastern</em> face of the Dome of the Rock, and the subtitle, "Jerusalem, 6:00 p.m." A moment later we see the title "Iraq, 6:03 p.m.", as Iraqi fighter planes stream west into the setting sun; and then, "Syrian-Israeli border, 6:03 p.m.", and flocks of helicopters and tanks with their shadows stretching out <em>in front of them</em> — except that Syria is east of Israel, so these helicopters and tanks appear to be invading <em>Syria</em> from <em>Israel</em> (Clark gave up after the next shot, "Mediterranean Sea 6:04 p.m.", which showed fighter planes with the sun directly overhead).
</li><li> Also, Iraq is an hour ahead of the other two countries. At the time the film was released, Iraq was still using DST (which was abolished in 2007). Whether it was summer or winter, it would've <em>always</em> been an hour ahead of Israel and Syria (both use DST to this very day).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Parodied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Parodied">Parodied</a> repeatedly in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">Austin Powers</a></em> movies. In the second, Austin and Felicity are driving through "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaliforniaDoubling">the English countryside</a>." As they pass palm trees, Austin remarks how it "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">looks nothing like southern California</a>." In the third, special effects were purposely used to put Mount Fuji (located specifically in Yamanashi Prefecture) in the background of every single exterior shot in Japan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em> the students go to "Old Orchard" mall, a well known mall in suburban Chicago. The mall shown in the movie is indoors (the scene was filmed at Sherway Gardens in Toronto), whereas Old Orchard is an outdoor mall.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyWiseau" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TommyWiseau">Tommy Wiseau</a> spliced in a slew of establishing shots of San Francisco in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom">The Room</a></em>, but the movie was filmed in LA. In addition to a very improbable scene of the lead character returning home from work on a cable car line that obviously could not exist, the rooftop scene is done using a "green screen". As the apartment building appears in the film, backgrounded by a postcard skyline view, the apartment building would have to be built out in the middle of the bay, or maybe on Alcatraz. It would look ridiculous to any San Francisco resident.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheXFilesFightTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheXFilesFightTheFuture">The X-Files: Fight the Future</a></em> movie, the government sets up its alien research camp in the desert just outside of Dallas, TX where the creature was found. Dallas and the North Texas area are located on the southern extension of the Great Plains, with the closest desert region at least 200 miles west of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Even worse, you wouldn't be able to see the Downtown Dallas skyline from that angle and distance. Too many hills and forests block the view. And let's not get started on those accents...
<ul><li> Not to mention all those mountains seen in the movie behind the Dallas skyline. Granted, Central Texas is known as the Hill Country, but that area starts approximately 100 miles south of Dallas - and there <em>is</em> a difference between <em>hills</em> and <em>mountains</em>...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RumbleInTheBronx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RumbleInTheBronx">Rumble in the Bronx</a></em> features shots of the lovely snow capped mountains for which the Bronx is known far and wide. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois">Oh, wait</a>... Also, many shots feature highly distinctive Vancouver landmarks in the background. And sometimes the foreground.
</li><li> Jackie Chan's <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrNiceGuy">Mr Nice Guy</a></em> features a chase sequence through central Melbourne, Australia, that features about two dozen sharp turns, two or three of which actually do exist in real life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCovenant">The Covenant</a></em> is particularly bad at this, if you know anything at all about the geography of Essex County, Massachusetts. Spencer Academy supposedly is in Ipswich, which is also the town where the party takes place near the beginning of the film. One of the characters mentions cutting across Marblehead to get away from the cops, which happens to be 20 miles away, down on the other side of Salem. Also, there are absolutely no cliffs along the coasts of Essex County. They are all either sandy or rocky, depending on how sheltered the coastline is, and how close it is to the mouth of the Merrimac River.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrinity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrinity">Blade: Trinity</a></em> is filmed in Vancouver, and local residents would notice that the characters seem to teleport around the city. The film is not actually supposed to be set in any particular city. The director purposefully included some Esperanto signs and even an Esperanto film (<em>Incubus</em>) to make the city seem somewhat foreign to everyone.
</li><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNakedGun">The Naked Gun</a></em> movie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeslieNielsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeslieNielsen">Leslie Nielsen</a> is picked up from LAX and taken to the Los Angeles Police Department Headquarters (presumably in Los Angeles). On the way, they pass the San Onofre Nuclear Power Plant, which is in <em>San Diego</em> County, just past the Orange County line but easily 75 miles from LAX. As this was a comedy and the power plant looks like two giant breasts (pointed out in this scene as a reference to one character's ex-girlfriend), the writers surely knew this. This is likely a reference to the short-lived TV show <em>Police Squad!</em> (which Naked Gun was based on). Even though the show took place in New York, you would frequently have backgrounds that clearly did not belong to New York City (i.e. when they are driving through "Little Italy" the background depicts the Roman Colosseum). The movie starts off with an LAPD detective running an undercover operation in the Middle East, so accuracy went right out the window from the word go.
</li><li> Two otherwise good war movies betray their locations: <em>Dawn Patrol</em> was set in Belgium but obviously filmed in Southern California (like every movie was at the time); <em>Dark Blue World</em> mostly takes place in southern England, but there are some conspicuous Eastern European mountains in the background of many scenes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenThousandBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenThousandBC">10,000 BC</a></em> the protagonist lives in a massive Ice Age mountain range, filled with tundra, glaciers, and mammoths. He then treks down from those mountains, almost immediately entering a verdant jungle with a transitional climate about ten yards across. On exiting said jungle and crossing another ten yard transition, he's in an arid desert. <a class="urllink" href="http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/fbv/bmbe/28660-10000-bc">Film Brain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BadMovieBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/BadMovieBeatdown">Bad Movie Beatdown</a></em> has a lot to say about the absurd geography in this film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Speed">Speed</a></em>, the freeway depicted as I-10 is actually I-105, which was already complete in real life, and the I-105 sequence was filmed on I-110, which actually was unfinished at the time. The bus also exits the east I-10 freeway onto Western (south) using a cloverleaf ramp that doesn't exist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, then goes from there to the I-105 in El Segundo (around 18 miles away) in <em>under a minute.</em>
</li><li> The opening freeway chase in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hancock">Hancock</a></em> is clearly filmed on a short one-mile stretch of the I-105 freeway in El Segundo, California (watch the buildings in the background). After the car is stopped on the I-105/I-405 transition, when Hancock carries it off, downtown Los Angeles is clearly shown in the background, even though it's 25 miles away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannonballRunII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannonballRunII">Cannonball Run II</a></em> is about a cross-country race from the West Coast to the East Coast of the United States. However, the entire movie was filmed in the outskirts of Tucson, AZ—even the finish line, which is said to be in Vermont, but there is a large saguaro cactus visible on the screen.
</li><li> The 2010 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyAdams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmyAdams">Amy Adams</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeapYear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LeapYear">Leap Year</a></em> is all over the place regarding Irish geography. The heroine's plane, traveling from Boston to Dublin, is forced to land in Cardiff, Wales due to terrible weather. She ends up hiring a boat to go to Cork for some reason; now even if we are to assume the storm blocks off Dublin Port, there are plenty of harbours closer to the city than Cork, which is on the southern coast of Ireland. Not that it matters, since bad weather forces the boat to put ashore in Dingle... which is not only west of Cork but right on the west coast of the country, and yet further away from Cardiff. Further, as in about adding about a third again onto her trip.
</li><li> In <em>Life-Size</em>, Casey Stuart tries to convince her father that Eve is a plastic doll come to life. Part of her argument is that Eve says she's from Sunnyvale, which is an obviously fake place that does not exist. Except that... yes, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnyvale">Sunnyvale is a very real location in California.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

When the sheriff shows up the next day to investigate a murder, his car identifies him as the Rawlins County sheriff. Problem is, there isn't a Rawlins County in Wyoming. There is a Carbon County, where Rawlins is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TakingLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TakingLives">Taking Lives</a></em>, somewhat unusually, rather than having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal">Montreal</a> stand in for some random American city, set the action in Montreal. Which they indicated with a big establishing shot of the Château Frontenac, the most famous landmark in... Quebec City (it's a little like establishing a scene in L.A. using a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnAmericanWerewolfInLondon">An American Werewolf in London</a></em>, there are no hospitals in Yorkshire. The nearest hospital is apparently 250 kilometres away in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritainIsOnlyLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritainIsOnlyLondon">London</a>. Might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>: the dialogue with the doctor after David regains consciousness suggests that he's been transferred to a London hospital because he's suspected of having some rare and exotic disease, which needs highly specialised skills and equipment of the sort that are usually only available in the more densely-populated south of England. The process of getting him to the nearest emergency room for an initial assessment and then down south for further treatment would still have been a significant undertaking however, probably involving a helicopter ride, but none of this is even touched upon in the film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrBeansHoliday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrBeansHoliday">Mr. Bean's Holiday</a></em>, Mr Bean accidentally takes a taxi in Paris from the Gare du Nord (in the North-East corner of the city) to the business district of La Défense (west of Paris). The taxi passes the Eiffel Tower (which is not even on the way) and then Notre-Dame de Paris (which lies to the East of the Eiffel Tower). Also, if the previous example could be explained, there is no way the Millau Viaduct is remotely on the way between Avignon (the station where Mr Bean was filmed escaping the police) and Cannes. But then, there is no way either a road trip in France can take more than ~10 hours, and that's if the motorways are really clogged. And if you cross the whole country. This film has some screwed up geography. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Maybe the cabbie was taking an extra screwy route to collect a better fare</a>?

There is also a lot of Spanish architecture, also indicative of a Mexican shooting location.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Charade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Charade">Charade</a></em>, a climactic ride on the Paris Metro is between clearly-labelled stations that are not connected by any single line; so it's important to the plot that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> never transfers from one train to another.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJackal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJackal">The Jackal</a></em>, Bruce Willis flees through a DC Metro tunnel from Capitol Heights to Metro Center stations, with Richard Gere in hot pursuit. Those stations are ten stops and a few miles apart. Never mind that the scenes are shot in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Montreal">Montreal</a> Metro, which looks nothing like the distinctive DC Metro architecture and has rubber tires.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Moonraker">Moonraker</a></em> has a particularly bad scene where Bond is fleeing down the Amazon River, then comes to Iguazu Falls (a distance comparable to Los Angeles-Chicago; to make matters worse, the Amazon doesn't end in a waterfall, and the Iguazu Falls aren't even in the Amazon watershed), for his meeting with Q, then somehow walks to the enemy base in a Mayan temple in Mexico, which is in a completely different hemisphere.
</li><li> The London boat chase in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldIsNotEnough">The World Is Not Enough</a></em> is full of this.
</li><li> The Rome car chase scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em> is a little strange if you're familiar with the local layout. Note that the cars turn right when they reach the Vatican, right again onto Via dei Corridori, then left onto Via del Mascherino...<em>away</em> from the Tiber. In order to get anywhere near the water, they'd have to immediately circle back towards Castel Sant'Angelo. Even then, the riverside sequence was shot by Ponte Sisto, which is further south.
</li><li> Speaking of Bond movies, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory">Very Loosely Based on a True Story</a> biopic of Bond author Ian Fleming showed how he was part of a secret WWII mission to recover some important German files located in "Halmstad, Norway". A quick research found the city of Halmstad in neutral <em>Sweden</em>, but this sort of artistic lisence is probably a Bond movie tradition.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NorthByNorthwest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NorthByNorthwest">North By Northwest</a></em>, Roger O. Thornhill is seen driving on a treacherous, winding coastal road along cliffs several hundred feet high in Long Island, New York. While there are some small cliffs in parts of Long Island, there is no scenery or road there anywhere approaching the type of landscape Grant was driving in, which was clearly modeled after the California coast.
<ul><li> Though in another scene the movie got it right: when Roger and his secretary are riding in a taxi from his Madison Avenue office to the Plaza Hotel, the rear-projected view through the taxi's back window is the actual route a vehicle would take between the two locations.
</li></ul></li><li> The war propaganda film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenBerets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreenBerets">The Green Berets</a></em> ends with a shot of the sun setting over the ocean. Only it's set in Vietnam, which has no western coastline, meaning the Sun would have to be setting in the east. There's also a suspicious lack of tropical vegetation and abundance of pine trees (it was filmed mainly in western Georgia).
<ul><li> Vietnam <em>does</em> have a west-facing coastline in the very south of the country, in Kien Giang and Ca Mau provinces. However, that would put the film's heroes in the Mekong Delta area, which has a rather wet and tropical climate  not one in which you typically find pine trees. Also, if it was filmed in Georgia, USA, where did they find a west-facing coast?

The English Channel is in the way (there's also the problem that Elizabeth's speech to the troops was not given before the Battle of Gravelines, but some days after; the troops were there to repel a possible invasion by the Duke of Parma, which never materialized). Any film about Elizabeth I that uses the phrase "golden age" non-sarcastically (her regime killed people at four times the rate of the Spanish Inquisition, and with much <em>less</em> fair trials) obviously doesn't care about historical details in the first place.

As long as they are keeping it real, one wonders why they felt compelled to move the University of British Columbia to the North Shore of Burrard Inlet rather than keeping it in its real location at the edge of the peninsula that forms the city of Vancouver.

He enters the Green Zone through the Assassin's Gate, which is located in the northeast side of the Green Zone. In the next shot, he's traveling East past the crossed swords toward the Monument of the Unknown Soldier, then he ends up at the Republican Palace. The problem is, the Republican Palace is in the southeast corner of the Green Zone and the crossed swords are near the northwestern border. To get to the Republican Palace from the Assassin's Gate through the crossed swords would require driving back and forth or around in circles. All he needed to do was stay on the same road south from the Assassin's Gate and he would have ended up at the palace.

In a flashback to said moment, they show Bogotá, a real-life city of nearly 7 million (at the time of filming) with a cool climate, portrayed as a small river-side town where the sun always shines, people listen to flamenco music and there's no need for clothes. To make things worse, a soldier speaks with a heavy Mexican accent. Even the actors said that they've never been to Bogotá, or Colombia, for that matter. Colombians were <em>so</em> not happy.

The movie portrays rural, ramshackle slums with open views onto the fabulous towers themselves. Kuala Lumpur looks <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/KL-Skyline_Night_HDR.JPG">like this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

The establishing shot shows snowy mountains and a beautiful lake surrounded by hills; the only problem is, although you can find a lot of cities that look like that in the southern part of the country, the real Villa Gesell is a beach city located nowhere near that area. The shot resembles the Argentinian city of Villa <em>La Angostura</em> where, according to legend, some Nazis hid away after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> with the help of President Perón.

Or rather, a small rural town that looks nothing like the actual, modern, skyscraper-encrusted college town that is the real Gainesville, Florida, but does look like a one-horse hick town in the middle of nowhere, which was probably the point. Apparently the producers wanted Kevin Lomax to be from a small rural town and picked Gainesville, Florida off of a map at random, not realizing that "small rural town" does <em>not</em> describe Gainesville, Florida, and hasn't for about a hundred years. The Civil War-era "courthouse" where the trial was taking place is actually in a one-stoplight town some thirty-two miles east of Gainesville, for example; the courthouses in Gainesville proper are all modern, multistory buildings.

The next scene they are out in the wilderness, and the scene after that they are in a diner in Utah. Boulder to Utah would be a 300+ mile hike, over the Rocky Mountains, and would take weeks even for seasoned backpackers.
</li><li> In <em>The Graffiti Artist</em>, one of the first scenes in the film is supposed to be set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Portland">Portland</a>, Oregon and has the main character getting on what is clearly a Seattle Metro bus at what is clearly 3rd and Pine, in the middle of downtown Seattle, as identifiable by the businesses around it and the appearance of the bus shelter. The disregard for the differences in geography between the two cities is in some cases justified because Seattle has better graffiti art (thanks to much more permissive laws), but there is no need for it in this scene.

At times, it looks suspiciously more like Hong Kong.
</li><li> The obscure American 1940 movie <em>Ski Patrol</em> follows a group of Finnish soldiers in the 1939 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union. The movie depicts the countries' border as a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.elitisti.net/web/public/captures/reviews/001750/001993-b.jpg">Middle European mountain range<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> — for reference, even the highest points of the countries' border don't rise above half a kilometre in height. Reportedly, the first panorama of this sight made the Finnish audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">burst into laughter</a>.

Kevin is seen taking a picture outside of Radio City Music Hall, which is in midtown Manhattan, and then at the Empire Diner in Chelsea. Next, he is shopping in Chinatown (which is in lower Manhattan), and then looking at the Statue of Liberty from Battery Park, which is all the way on the southernmost part of the island. After that, he heads up to the World Trade Center's observation deck, visits Central Park, and finally arrives at the Plaza Hotel. And Kevin somehow manages to do all of this <em>in just a couple of hours</em>, when it would at least take half a day to do so.

The female protagonist and her friends take a weekend trip to Puerto Vallarta from California (which would be a two-day drive if they took a bus), and the titular Chihuahua gets kidnapped and driven to Mexico City, however, some scenes are set in Guadalajara, which is six hours away from Mexico City. Going to all these places would have taken an entire week by car, yet, the film's time frame is set within three days. And, the most egregious example of all, in which both History and Geography fail in one scene, presumably all the Chihuahua dogs in Mexico gather by a Mayan temple in the state of Chihuahua, for a ceremony. The Maya civilization was set on the far South of Mexico and most of Central America, while Chihuahua, which borders on New Mexico and Texas, never housed a particular culture for an extended time. Also, the state is depicted as a jungle-heavy terrain, when it is mostly desert.
</li><li> In <em>Wild Orchid</em> a cab driver goes from Galeão Airport to what seems to be some beach in Recreio (a 55 km travel, at longest), but he was considerate enough to take the passenger to visit the Pelourinho, a beautiful landmark ... in Salvador, Bahia! A detour that turns a 55 km trip in a 1,624 km travel! The Pelourinho isn't even located in the same region of Brazil. To a Brazilian, or anyone who has taken one extended vacation on Brazil, it was a blunder comparable to a cab leaving JFK, taking a shortcut in Gateway Arch, in St. Louis, before arriving in the Bronx.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla1998">Godzilla (1998)</a></em>:
<ul><li> A major plot point about how Godzilla remains hidden despite his size is because he burrows into the New York subways and sewers. But these are only about fifty metres down at their deepest; Godzilla wouldn't be able to tunnel through them without leaving obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wormsign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wormsign">Wormsign</a> and easy detectable seismic disturbances (never mind the fact he definitely couldn't fit into them anyway).
</li><li> During the helicopter chase sequences, Godzilla and the copters are funnelled down labyrinth-like streets of squashed-together skyscrapers that all tower above Godzilla. It should go without saying that Manhattan doesn't remotely resemble that.
</li><li> During the military's second fight with Godzilla, there's an underwater naval battle between the monster and three submarines in the Hudson River. However, the Hudson is only about two-hundred feet in depth at its deepest (with an average depth of only <em>thirty</em> feet); Godzilla could stand on the bottom and his head would be well above the surface. In the film though, Godzilla is shown <em>diving</em> in the Hudson and the riverbed is still nowhere in sight.
</li><li> At the finale, the main characters lead Godzilla from the Park Ave Tunnel to the Brooklyn Bridge after stating its the closest suspension bridge over the East River to their location. It's actually the <em>furthest</em>: Manhattan Bridge and Williamsburg Bridge are both much closer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Godzilla2014">Godzilla (2014)</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are plenty of radiation sources in China and Japan far closer to the Philippines than the Kanto region, Yucca Mountain was never operational nor that close to Las Vegas, and all three creatures take the long way from their respective positions to end up in San Francisco. Within the locations however, the geography is quite good — Godzilla takes a reasonable path from Waikiki to the airport, the Female MUTO heads the right way on the Vegas Strip, and so on.
</li><li> Ford's son is evacuated to Oakland Regional Park (which doesn't actually exist, though Redwood Regional Park in Oakland does) by bus. Via the Golden Gate Bridge. Those familiar with the the layout of the city know the Golden Gate Bridge leads north while Oakland is in the east. To get there via the Golden Gate Bridge would take far longer. It would make more sense to head east via the Bay Bridge. A possible explanation though is that the city needed to be evacuated at all points due to the sheer amount of traffic trying to evacuate roughly a million people out of the city would create. It would make sense then to have some people evacuated to the north while others are evacuated to the south and directly to the east. It's still a stretch though.
</li><li> The Golden Gate Bridge itself is 220 feet above the water, which is an additional 360 feet deep. Godzilla is 350 feet tall, so standing it wouldn't even break the surface near let alone whack into the middle span, and could easily swim under it.

To their credit, they do their best to hide the fact they're in Chicago, such as dressing up the train in appropriate signage, but even so, you can see the station signs for Clark / Lake station as Spider-Man and Dock Ock are gaining their footing on the train roof.
<ul><li> On top of that, the elevated train is designated as an R train, which runs underground along its entire route.
</li><li> Not all of the fight was filmed in Chicago, though, as the scene where Spider-Man is thrown from the train, and is briefly dragged along the street was filmed under the Harlem Valley viaduct on the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line, one of the only two above-ground segments of track within Manhattan.

</li><li> The "Europe-Express" in <em>The Cassandra Crossing</em> takes a zig-zag path through Europe that's just outlandish. It's clear that the script of this film was written by Americans who didn't know anything about Europe and just lined up what few European cities they could think of. For example:
<ul><li> The train starts in Geneva, which is close to the French border. It could directly head for Paris via Mâcon. So why send it via Basel?
</li><li> A stopover in Paris is next to impossible or at least very difficult to carry out. All major stations in Paris are dead-ends, and there isn't a single mainline going through Paris, they all end there, each of them in one designated station (for example, trains from Belgium terminate at the Gare du Nord, trains from eastern France and southern Germany terminate at the Gare de l'Est, and trains from Switzerland and southeastern France terminate at the Gare de Lyon). Since the French mainline network is designed mostly in a hub-and-spoke fashion with Paris being the sole hub, sending trains to a different terminal would involve gigantic detours, at least one more change of direction and/or chugging along slowly on non-electrified branch lines behind a diesel. It was even worse in those days without the high-speed network.
</li><li> If a hypothetical train were to travel from Basel via eastern France, Luxembourg and Belgium to Germany (which in reality it wouldn't, see below), it'd leave Brussels out.
</li><li> Long-distance trains in general don't go through Amsterdam either. While it's technically possible, it simply isn't feasible, seeing as where Amsterdam lies. Whenever international trains coming from Germany did a stopover in Amsterdam CS, they terminated just a few miles further west at Schiphol airport station or in Hoofddorp, but they would <em>never</em> continue to Brussels. And trains coming from Brussels would always terminate at Amsterdam CS. For passenger rail traffic between Germany and Belgium, the way via Cologne is always the best.
</li><li> Trains from Switzerland to northern Germany or Scandinavia have never taken a route via France and Benelux, and they never would. They'd most likely go directly into Germany, down the Rhine, via Cologne and through the Ruhr Area. Either that or past Frankfurt eastward, up the North-South Line and via Hanover.
</li><li> The writers obviously didn't know anything about the Warsaw Pact either. The train is being re-routed through Czechoslovakia to Poland, both Warsaw Pact countries, with NATO armed forces aboard. The Soviet Red Army has sent troops and tanks into Warsaw Pact countries in reality for probably less than this. <br/>Even if the train did make it to the Cassandra bridge, it would leave behind traces of a top-secret biological weapon developed by the USA, so secret that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hundreds of innocents have to be killed</span> in a cover-up, but then ready to be picked up by the KGB.
</li><li> The train's destination is named Janov and located in southern Poland. If anything, it should be spelled "Janów" then.
</li></ul></li><li> In the German film <em>Zugvögel — Einmal nach Inari</em>, there are a few shots from inside a train that's supposed to approach the German island of Fehmarn via the Fehmarnsund Bridge on its way to Scandinavia. However, those familiar with the island can easily tell that the shots were taken from a southbound train that <em>left</em> the island. It was shot on location at least, but still.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsUpDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsUpDoc">What's Up, Doc?</a></em> was filmed on location in San Francisco, but a number of locations were intentionally changed into fictitious settings. The Hotel Bristol that much of the film takes place in was actually the Hilton. As for two locations specified by address in the third act, Mr. Larrabee's home at "888 Russian Hill" was actually 2018 California Street, while the jewel thieves' hideout at "459 Dirella Street" was actually Historic Pier 70 located around 22nd Street.
</li><li> Sheffield locals would be bemused at the ease that characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFullMonty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFullMonty">The Full Monty</a></em> could get a five-minute bus ride covering 30 miles from one side of the city to the other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AScannerDarkly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AScannerDarkly">A Scanner Darkly</a></em> gets a lot right about its Orange County, California, setting, to the point that the filmmakers have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>. However, there are a few nits. For example, when the main characters are in a car on Interstate 5 traveling south from Anaheim to San Diego, they break down at Culver Avenue in Irvine. The views outside their car show the proper landmarks for these locations. When they take a tow truck back home, they're traveling north, and we see them pass proper landmarks around the Marketplace shopping center and office park in Irvine and Tustin. However, people familiar with this stretch of highway will notice that they pass the same locations several times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackReacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JackReacher">Jack Reacher</a></em> takes place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> and was filmed on location. Except Reacher seems to teleport around the city during the same sequences. For example, one car chase involves him speeding through a tunnel for a good 20-30 seconds before slamming into water barrels on the other end and getting out. Any denizen of Pittsburgh will instantly recognize the Armstrong Tunnel, which is only 0.02 miles in length, and the street where the tunnel comes out, Forbes Ave, doesn't have any barrels at the end, since that would prevent traffic along the street. You also wouldn't expect to see a crowd of older people just standing at an intersection there, since it's the location of Duquesne University (true, people could be coming to or from a Penguins game, but no one in that crowd was wearing the team colors). And a key plot point about "<em>the</em> auto part store" makes zero sense, since there isn't one key auto part store that immediately comes to mind to Pittsburghers.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AGoodDayToDieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AGoodDayToDieHard">A Good Day to Die Hard</a></em>, McClane and Jack drive from Moscow to Chernobyl in what looks like a few hours. First of all, the two locations are in different countries, with about 530 miles separating them. And the roads there aren't exactly the well-maintained autobahn. In addition, you have two Americans crossing borders without passports in a stolen car full of weapons, with plenty of police and military checkpoints between them and their destination (which is located in a restricted area, mind you). They also somehow catch up to a helicopter that flew in that direction several hours earlier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troy">Troy</a></em> expects us to believe that Mycenae was located on a sea coast, when, in fact, the real city was about 12 miles inland.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonicTheHedgehog2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonicTheHedgehog2020">Sonic the Hedgehog (2020)</a></em>, when Sonic and Robotnik arrive in Egypt near the Giza pyramids, there's nothing but desert visible in all directions. The pyramids and the Sphinx are actually surrounded by roads, numerous other monuments, and city on three sides. In fact, there's a KFC/Pizza Hut combination restaurant <em>less than 1000 feet</em> from the Sphinx itself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesOfGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiftyShadesOfGrey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></em>'s poster. Unless Christian's office is located on a SHIELD Helicarrier, the skyline in the movie poster is being shot looking out of a building that physically does not and cannot exist in Seattle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArmyOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ArmyOfDarkness">Army of Darkness</a></em> is set in a medieval European kingdom that looks <em>exactly</em> like Southern California, deserts and all, and makes absolutely no attempt to hide this.

When leaving the Louvre, the main characters head to the American embassy, realize they can't get there, and head for Gare Saint-Lazare. To get from the Louvre to where they start making their detour, they would already have passed the American embassy. Teabing parks on the House Guard Parade, so he can see the Parliament and Temple Church. In reality, from that position, he would be able to see neither. Several buildings block the view, and there are no parks to look across, as claimed in the book. Brown also claims the church of Saint-Sulpice lies on the Paris meridian; as a sign in the actual church helpfully points out, it doesn't.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> early books were pretty bad on Chicago geography. Particularly notable was when Harry had a meeting in the massive parking lot outside Wrigley Field (in reality, it has about twenty spaces). He also moves the University of Chicago from Hyde Park (on the south side) to Lincoln Park (on the north side). Possibly he mixed up U of C with DePaul. Later on, after author Jim Butcher actually visited Chicago (and got info from fans who live there), he got better about it. This is lampshaded in the Tabletop RPG core book. The section on City Creation features, "For instance, let's say the local baseball stadium suddenly gains a parking lot..." Harry, who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">reading over the notes for accuracy's sake</a>, sardonically laughs about it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LeftBehind">Left Behind</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first novel, Buck is forced to make his way from Chicago to New York after the Rapture causes all manner of destruction. The timeline described is ridiculous, with Buck taking far longer using chartered planes and such to travel the distance than he would have simply by driving back roads. It culminates in a 20-mile bike ride along 13-mile long Manhattan.
</li><li> One of the later books describes huge ships on the River Jordan, which is actually very shallow and could not accommodate ships of any kind.
</li></ul></li><li> Rick Riordan (<em>Heroes of Olympus</em>) seems to think Mt. Diablo is like some kind of lowland Yosemite mixed with the Australian outback when truthfully it's just a gentle rolling brown hill with hardly any foliage on it. Anyone who actually looked at Mt. Diablo at even Google Maps could tell you the top is NOT a depression with eucalyptus trees, but rather a visitors' center, and there really aren't any cliffs like described. And while it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotPoint">Plot Point</a>, there are not enough—or any—eucalyptus trees surrounding the mountain, certainly not enough to be overpowering. Early morning in the middle of winter might not be freezing, but it's cold. And the Golden Brown Berkeley hills are just that, golden brown — during summer. They do, in fact, get green(ish) in the winter.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">The Lightning Thief</a></em> has a scene where Percy jumps from the top of the Gateway Arch into the Mississippi River. Considering that the Arch is a hundred yards or more from the river under ordinary circumstances, with some wide concrete walkways, a huge 64-step grand staircase, and a road in between, he'd need a hang glider to do that in real life. (See <a class="urllink" href="http://www.palmbeachbiketours.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/St-Louis-Riverfront-and-Arch-10-17-2004_5604.jpg">this photo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> for reference.) Even during flood season, the closest the river has ever been to the Arch is halfway up the staircase.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> is absolutely <em>terrible</em> about this. Author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer">Stephenie Meyer</a> seems to have confused the Olympic Peninsula with northern Alaska, since she represents Forks as almost consistently overcast (simply googling "Rainiest Town in America" is more or less all Meyer did by her own admission in the introduction) and, well, twilit, yet at the same time underestimates how cold it can get at night, even in summer. She also seems to have forgotten that, yes, the Pacific Northwest does have a summer. A very sunny summer. It could go all of July and August, and sometimes September, without being completely overcast. Do the Cullens go on a three-month camping trip every year? At another point "the west coast of Brazil" is mentioned. Anyone who did basic research would tell you that "West" is probably the one cardinal direction you couldn't really say that Brazil has a coast on. There are also multiple problems with Seattle geography: Lake Union is referred to as "Union Lake", and the shady part of town that Bella visits in the last book is vaguely reminiscent of some parts of Aurora Avenue but doesn't come close enough to any real part of the city to be believable. There is also no accounting for distance. The entire state of Washington appears to be significantly scaled down, as drives from Forks to places like Seattle and Port Angeles are described as taking far shorter than they would in real life. A drive from there to Alaska is also described as taking <em>16 hours</em>, which is simply not possible on land.

</li><li> In <em>The Terror of Blue John Gap</em>, the narrator at one point travels from the eponymous cave (which is a source of the semi-precious stone Blue John) to Castleton in Derbyshire, some 14 miles away.

It could be chalked up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicense">Poetic License</a>: Kipling was very well-traveled and knew geography very well; the bit about "thunder from China" is a simile (parsed "the dawn comes up like thunder outer China 'crost the Bay"), and specifying a bay makes it clear that he's talking about the east-facing coastline of the Gulf of Martaban. Specifically in Rangoon, which is also home to the "old Moulmein Pagoda" mentioned in the first line. So...
</li><li> Andrew Holleran admitted that he had written the part of <em>Dancer from the Dance</em> set in Washington, D.C., before ever setting foot in D.C. I could tell.

</li><li> The hero of a Heian Japanese tale somehow manages to be shipwrecked on the Persian coast while traveling from Japan to China.

In the book, the Joads are driven from Sallisaw due to the Dust Bowl ruining the land. The problem? Sallisaw is located in the eastern half of Oklahoma, commonly referred to as <em>green country</em>. It never experienced the Dust Bowl.

<ul><li> There's also the fact that he invents a South Carolina town out of the blue for the time-travelers to come from; it could have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> if it was just them, but the fact that one of the main characters is also from the town becomes an important plot point.

In the foreword for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWasteLands">The Waste Lands</a></em>, he notes that his New York readers will notice that he has taken "certain geographical liberties" with the city. In the later books, when he writes himself into the story, he distorts the geography of Maine (where he lives) because he doesn't want people harassing him in his home. The former becomes a plot point later on when Eddie finds out that Co-op City, where he's from, is in a different part of New York City on Keystone Earth than it is in the version of Earth he's from.
<ul><li> He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">discusses</a> this trope when talking about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em>.

One victim is found on a rock at Bachman Lake Park. The hero of the story, a paranormal investigator, is examining the crime scene with a local police detective. Their conversation is pretty standard for the genre—bloodstains, time of death, witnesses, &amp;c. What's missing from their exchange are the times when they would not be able to hear each other due to the jet airliners landing at and taking off every five minutes from the adjacent Love Field airport.

It starts in chapter 2, where he places the Lightning Creek trail on the wrong side of the valley (it's on the east side, since the creek runs up against the hillside on the west), requiring the characters to cross the creek when they turn east (in June, it's still in full spring flood, and crossing is best done another day's travel upstream) and proceed through a Douglas Fir forest (it's actually Ponderosa) that is remarkably mud- and snow-free. A character proceeds to map the area from a mountaintop, noting that Snowshoe Peak is visible "between east and south", that parts of Lake Pend Oreille are visible (this is true of only three peaks in the eastern Lightning Creek drainage, and all three are very nearly due west of Snowshoe Peak), and that mountains are visible in every direction except west (oops, all three have mountains to the west). By chapter 7, it's clear he's making terrain up as he needs it: the hills are a thousand feet taller than they actually are, the slopes lessened so that a character can reasonably climb straight up-slope, and the trees are removed from the ridgelines for improved visibility (and plot-relevant reasons later on); directions to reach a highly-secret middle-of-nowhere location place it solidly in the middle of the well-traveled Bull River valley. The climax of the story involves a fast-spreading crown fire of the sort only seen in late August of especially dry years but happens in late June when the forest is much too wet to burn.

Sinclair calls the land used by cattle ranchers in the west as "prime potential farmland" — however, in the West, cattle are run on dry rangeland that has insufficient irrigation to raise crops. In the fuel-starved area (which the western strip of the US was described as) it would only be harder, not easier, to irrigate those areas. Using cattle to convert grass into protein is actually the <em>efficient</em> use of the land.

<ul><li> Anastasia Steele drives south from Vancouver, Washington to Portland, Oregon to get to Seattle, Washington (which is <em>north</em> of Vancouver, Washington).
</li><li> In <em>Fifty Shades Darker</em>, Christian Grey says the following after disappearing for about eight hours:
<div class="indent"> "I heard the TFR was lifted a while back and I wanted to take a look. Well, its fortunate that we did. We were flying low, about two hundred feet AGL when the instrument panel lit up. We had a fire in the tailI had no choice but to cut all the electronics and land. He shakes his head. I set her down by Silver Lake, got Ros out, and managed to put the fire out.
</div><ul><li> A TFR is a Temporary Flight Restriction. There were no Temporary Flight Restrictions on Mount St. Helens for all of 2011, when this book is set. There were none for all of 2009, either, when E.L. James wrote the fanfic <em>Master of the Universe</em>. The last time that there was a TFR in effect around Mount St. Helens was in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.hillsboroflying.org/files/HfcNewsletter200812.pdf">2008<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> three <em>years</em> before the timeline of the book.
</li><li> According to the FAA, the minimum safe altitude for helicopters in a congested areacities, towns, settlements, or open-air gathering places like campgrounds, bandshells, arenas, stadiums, etc. is an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal radius of 2,000 feet of the aircraft. Grey said that his altitude—his AGL—was about 200 feet. In addition to Mount St. Helens being 37 miles from Longview, Washington, 43 miles from Vancouver, Washington, and 51 miles from Portland, Oregon—thus making this a congested area—guess what the highest obstacle in the vicinity of Mount St. Helens is? Mount Adams, which is about thirty-four miles east of Mount St. Helens. Mount St. Helens is 8,635 feet high. Mount Adams is <em>12,277 feet high.</em> If Grey didn't want to smash into <em>the largest active volcano in Washington state</em>, he should have been — at a minimum — 13,277 feet up.
</li><li> Silver Lake is part of has three hiking trails running through it, one of which is right next to the area where Grey allegedly landed and which encircles the entire park. Grey and Ros could have started at one end and gone all the way to the other; they were, at MOST, three miles away from help. And the GPS on their phones, which Grey mentions, should have told them this. Silver Lake is also adjacent to a state highway, an interstate highway, and a 475-acre campground, and has two Visitor's Centers within walking distance.
</li><li> Also the Forest Learning Center is on Highway 504, inside the blast zone of the volcano. That's operated by Weyerhaeuser Company, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and the freakin' State Department of Transportation. Oh, and it features HELICOPTER TOURS. Helicopter tours that leave every half hour from 10-6 daily. Gee, do you think that one of those 'copter pilots would have seen a private helicopter on fire and trying to land, or would have seen the flames on the ground? Do you think that info might have been relayed to <em>every pilot and ranger around Mount St. Helens</em>?

<ul><li> Apparently, among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a> caused the ice caps to melt and now everything but America is underwater. However, Manhattan and America's coastline are somehow completely fine. Furthermore, all of the countries and continents are rubble, destroyed during the war. Rhine mentions that all that's left are tiny uninhabitable islands and the continent of North America. All of this destruction has absolutely no ill effects on the ecosystem, weather, sea level, or anything else in America. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Sever</em> hints at this not being entirely true, however</span>.
</li><li> Antarctica is also included as a casualty. <em>Antarctica</em>. The one place where a nuke would be completely unnecessary under any and all circumstances.

In reality, exposed rock is visible along many areas of the coastline, and the ice tends to appear rose- or emerald-colored rather than white.
</li><li> In his Scientific American column "The Church of the Fourth Dimension" (reprinted in <em>Further Mathematical Diversions</em>), Martin Gardner speaks of "an imaginary visit" to London and the titular Church, during which "a mist was blowing in from the sea" as he exited from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLondonUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLondonUnderground">the Tube</a>. The problem here is that in the lack of definite identification as such (as is the case with a mist), something is only identifiable as being "from the sea" if the sea is only a few miles away (preferably above the horizon). The nearest seacoast to London is Brighton, about 60 miles away; a mist attempting to drift from there would almost immediately run into Shacktonbury Ridge, a tall and densely-wooded hill, and if it got past that would have to somehow survive passing over several towns — and Gatwick Airport.
<ul><li> London is much closer to the east coast than the south. The centre of the City of London is only about 25 miles from the sea, while the eastern-most tube station is Upminster on the District line, only about 10 miles from the sea. In addition, the Thames is tidal for almost its whole length through London, so it can reasonably be described as being the sea just about anywhere in the city.

Later on, they are told that they were seen by several Muggles in various places — including "Flying around the Post Office Tower". A few minutes with Google Maps shows that all tracks from King's Cross initially head towards the northwest, while the BT Tower (to give it its actual modern name) is <em>south</em>west of King's Cross. So essentially Harry and Ron must have said: "it's important that we follow the Hogwarts Express and keep it in sight, but before we do that, let's waste several minutes on flying in the wrong direction".

The journey taken in Episode One was observed to go round in circles, double back on itself, meander miles to the north and miles to the south of the assumed destination, leap instantly between locations as if the car was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Tardis</a>, and in one scene it appeared to visit a completely different town <em>sixty miles away</em> from Manchester.

A quick peek outside the door revealed rocky hills, scrub, and lots of dust. Viewers in coastal Virginia rolled their eyes.
</li><li> An episode of MSNBC's <em>To Catch a Predator</em> was set in Riverside, California, but all of the wrap-around shots were from Huntington Beach, which is 50 miles away from Riverside. This might be okay, except that several shots featured the Huntington Beach Pier. Riverside has several things between the city and the ocean, including several other cities and a mountain range.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho">Jericho</a></em> seems to forget that Kansas is bigger than Rhode Island. Throughout the series, characters see mountains from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMountainsOfIllinois">Central Kansas</a></em> (mountains are not visible from anywhere in Kansas), travel less than an hour to drive over 500 miles from Wichita to Denver and act like Topeka is next door. (There are approximately 140 miles and several towns between the two.)
</li><li> The made-for-TV Olsen sisters' film <em>Passport to Paris</em> had a huge blooper. An animation sequence showed their plane crossing over the Atlantic, flying over London, then over the Channel, then over France and the Mediterranean sea to eventually land somewhere in North Africa. The Channel is not the Mediterranean sea.

This was especially amusing when the towns involved were separated by several other towns.
</li><li> Hilariously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em> when scenes supposed to be in Pennsylvania were shot in a distinctive area of Ellicott City, Maryland. The characters mention every few minutes that they're in Whatevertown, Pennsylvania. (The show was filmed on location in Baltimore and was fairly popular there.)
</li><li> It happens from time to time on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em>, what with teams traveling all over the world and all, but never so gloriously as in the Season 16 premiere, when Jordan, despite constantly being reminded that they were going to Chile, proceeds to request tickets to Santiago, <em>China</em>.
</li><li> In British magician Derren Brown's one-off show <em>The Gathering</em> he performed a trick whereby he predicted which country somebody would think of out of all of the countries in the world. The "country" he predicted? <em>Africa</em>. He was correct. (Is this a failure on the part of him, or the audience member?)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a></em>. One example being a question about the smallest English county — expected "wrong" answer being Rutland, with the "correct" answer being the Isle of Wight, which apparently has a smaller area at the relevant tidemark. Unfortunately, in traditional terms the Isle of Wight isn't a county (it's part of Hampshire, and Rutland <em>was</em> the smallest traditional county), and in modern terms, both the reinstated Rutland and the IoW are unitary authorities — the smallest of which is Blackpool.
<ul><li> The traditional counties are counties which used to exist but don't necessarily still exist or have their original boundaries. A unitary authority, while being for most purposes a county in all but name, is still considered for ceremonial purposes to be part of a county. Hence the entities known as Ceremonial Counties, which are the current officially existing counties, which have the ceremonial institutions of a county such as a Lord Lieutenant and which may govern all their own territory, or alternatively some or even all of their territory may be under the control of unitary authorities. In any case, QI was wrong because the City of London is a separate Ceremonial County in its own right, not part of Greater London.
</li><li> In one episode, Welsh comedian Rhod Gilbert seemed completely unable to comprehend that Denmark and Norway are not the same place, repeatedly claiming Denmark gets no sunlight in winter despite being told multiple times that it doesn't by an increasingly annoyed Sandi Toksvig (who is Danish). Alan Davies cuts the tension beautifully when he tells the Welshman, "Denmark's the same latitude as Scotland. You know, where you're from!"

Then he went to Ottawa. Then he went to Brazil. So his father followed him to Ottawa on a vengeance mission. Apparently, Ottawa is some harbour-front dive-down, inhabited by rednecks in cowboy shirts. In order to enter Ottawa, you have to parachute out of a clunker aeroplane. And then, another character follows the father to Ottawa. By chartering a boat. <em>From Wisconsin</em>. While geographically possible, it still requires a detour through four lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway.

</li><li> Phoebe had a scientist boyfriend called David, who went to Minsk on a research trip. Minsk is stated to be in Russia several times, while it actually is the capital of Belarus.
</li><li> <em>Friends</em> seemed to live in a strange, compressed geography that takes its characters anywhere they need to go in about twenty minutes. This compression also seems to extend to other places. On "TOW The Girl From Poughkeepsie" Ross falls asleep on the train and wakes up in Montreal. He meets a young woman who says from there "it's only a two-hour ferry ride to Nova Scotia." Actually, it's another six hours to get to St. John's, Nfld., and THEN a two-hour ferry ride to NS.

Argentina's beaches are all on the Atlantic, and you're more likely to find pine trees than anything even slightly resembling Robin's flashback. This is probably to do with how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Ted</a> is telling it.

Evidently the HIGNFY writers (or one the newspapers they got the story from) didn't realize that the state name was <em>North</em> Carolina, and it wasn't a phrasing analogous to how you might say something happened in "north(ern) France". Perhaps their confusion was reinforced by the common North Carolinian habit of referring to that state as "Carolina".

Now, while Chelsea has many upper-class parts to it, there are also several working-class areas as well. There is <em>no way</em> that anybody could identify a "Dagenham accent" as opposed to any other working-class area of London. But just try convincing Henry Higgins of that.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15syka');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15syka" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15syka');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To be fair here: comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DudleyMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DudleyMoore">Dudley Moore</a>, a man not unknown in the USA, specifically created a comic character acting as a foil to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCook">Peter Cook</a>, who exaggerated his upper-working class origins — in Dagenham — for comic effect.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS">US version</a> of <em>Shameless</em> had a character drive from Chicago to Detroit to Toronto and then back to Chicago during the span of a single night. It takes about 910 hours to make that drive one way, not counting any delays at the border. The dialogue suggests that they thought that Toronto was just across the river from Detroit. It's not. <em>Windsor</em> is directly across the Detroit River from Detroit. Toronto is more-or-less across Lake Ontario from Buffalo, New York, almost 300 miles and four hours of non-stop, absolute-speed-limit driving further east from Detroit.

The Area that they head to is located in south-eastern Saskatchewan (known for being mostly flatland with some hills), yet features a huge Mountain range and obviously Japanese Flora. South-western Alberta might have been a better call on that one, what with the Rockies in all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheEvent">The Event</a></em> Vicky describes Murmansk as being in "Western Siberia." This could be a in-show mistake, but Murmansk is near the Finnish border in the most northwestern part of Russia, further west than Moscow (similar to saying Maine is in the Eastern part of the Old West).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note167u0d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note167u0d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note167u0d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Siberia isn't a well defined area, but everyone agrees that it is east of the Urals.

</li><li> 1967 western <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CimarronStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CimarronStrip">Cimarron Strip</a></em> was filmed in a variety of places, including Utah and Southern California — both of which look nothing like the Oklahoma panhandle, where it purportedly took place; where the real "Cimarron Strip" is flat and covered in prairie grass, the show's version is mountainous and sandy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TorchwoodMiracleDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TorchwoodMiracleDay">Torchwood: Miracle Day</a></em> has the main characters arrive in Venice, California on their way to a location in Los Angeles. When asked by the Gwen, the Welsh character where their final destination is, the American character Esther answers that it's technically in another city: Los Angeles while they're in Venice. Venice is part of the City of Los Angeles. It's also a plot point in <em>Miracle Day</em> that Shanghai and Buenos Aires are antipodes. According to Google Maps, that's about 150 miles off.
</li><li> Viewers who are familiar with Kansas can never watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em> without smirking at how much greener, hillier, and wetter the in-show Kansas is compared to the real-world Kansas, and how much the in-show Kansas looks like the Vancouver area. Metropolis is within visual range and an hour or two's drive from Smallville. It has a waterfront. The nearest ocean to Kansas is the Gulf of Mexico, over 400 miles away through Oklahoma and Texas. The nearest major water body is Lake Michigan, through Missouri and Illinois. It might be a large river, but there are none of those in Kansas, barring the Missouri, and the water establishing shots is pretty clearly too wide to be that. Oddly enough, Vancouver has docks as well. Even in the DC Universe this is artistic license. In the comics, Metropolis is in Delaware, which you might notice is nowhere near Kansas.
</li><li> On one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>, Harm's partner is kidnapped by gangbangers in South Central L.A. They tell Harm to drive back to Camp Pendleton, grab one of their members who has joined the Marines, and bring him back in one hour. Camp Pendleton is 90 miles from Los Angeles — even with no traffic it would be extremely difficult to make the drive down there in one hour, let alone back.
<ul><li> In several episodes they also drive awfully fast from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WashingtonDC">Washington, D.C.</a> to both Norfolk and Blacksburg in Virginia. Norfolk is in the southeast corner of Virginia, about 3 hours and change from DC without traffic delays. Blacksburg is near the western end of Virginia, about 4 hours from DC and even farther from Norfolk.

He says "what do they have going on there? Deer ticks?" In actuality, Newburgh is a city with almost 30,000 people and, at time, enough street crime to make Lenny appreciate his job in Manhattan. Justified, because the assumption that all of upstate is extremely rural and that life there is altogether uneventful is an entirely realistic depiction of the attitudes of people from the city.
<ul><li> On the other hand, Newburgh is located in Orange County, which has one of the highest rates of Lyme Disease of any county in the United States.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>, Picard sits in a cafe in Paris with the Eiffel Tower behind his table. He then gets up, turns in a different direction to look at the view... with the Eiffel Tower in the background. This could be somewhat forgiven as it takes place on the holodeck.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> has an attack that etches a swath of destruction 4000 kilometers long, stated to be all the way from Florida to Venezuela. 4000 kilometers would indeed reach all the way from the northwestern corner of Florida almost all the way across Venezuela, but it starts in lower central Florida and proceeds almost due south, which is accurately shown to cut across Cuba and Panama (and, by extension, well into the Pacific Ocean). Unless at least Columbia and Panama got folded into Venezuela, it's not exactly on the way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>:
<ul><li> Though set in San Francisco, this show was mostly filmed in Los Angeles. This was painfully evident in "Mr. Monk Is Up All Night" when Monk goes to a train station and it's obviously Los Angeles Union Station, not the Fourth and King Street Station. So one wonders just how far he wandered off into the night. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">It's a much nicer train station, but still...</a>
</li><li> "Mr. Monk and the Other Detective" has a body being dumped near the San Bruno Caltrain station. On screen, the body is found in a hilly wooded area. You couldn't possibly really hide a body near the real San Bruno Caltrain or BART stations, as they sit in the middle of very dense neighborhoods, on flat ground, with no palm trees.
</li><li> In "Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing," a house catches fire and a young woman is killed. Stottlemeyer says in the alleyway scene that the house is in the same area of the city as the alley dumpster where the fireman's coat and hat were found, which is said to be the Tenderloin. Except the house shown is clearly in a suburban residential neighborhood. The Tenderloin is a rough neighborhood of downtown San Francisco where there are single row occupancy units and apartment buildings, not nice homes.
<ul><li> Furthermore, the firehouse where Monk is blinded is said to be five blocks from the scene of the fire, but the buildings around the garage in the establishing shot clearly do not look anything like the Tenderloin region, which is also very hilly. In fact, based on the appearance of the surrounding area, it would be more realistic if the firehouse was in the Sunset District of San Francisco.
</li></ul></li><li> "Mr. Monk is On The Run" Part Two depicts Riverton, California as a small town. It's actually just an unincorporated community on US Highway 50.
<ul><li> In that same episode, you see Stottlemeyer receive a postcard from Monk, in hiding. The address shown on the card is for the city of San Francisco with the zip code 90019. That's actually a zip code for <em>Los Angeles</em>. The actual zip code for the address shown, after checking with the U.S. Postal Service website, is 94105.
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, in "Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert," there is no valley close to San Francisco inside the SFPD jurisdiction that would match the area where the concert grounds are. A nice aversion comes if you notice that there is a postcard in Greg Murray's trailer addressed to a postal box with an actual San Francisco zip code (94188).
</li><li> Monk's apartment in the series and in the novels is said to be on Pine Street a few blocks west of Van Ness Boulevard. However, the stock establishing shots show his apartment as being on the southeast corner of Taylor Street and Broadway, far removed from Pine Street.
</li><li> The cover art of the novel <em>Mr. Monk on Patrol</em> gets this. The novel starts in San Francisco, takes place primarily in Summit, New Jersey, but the police car on the cover art is clearly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> Police Department vehicle (Monk being positioned so as to hide the word "CHICAGO" on the car's doors).
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vegas2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vegas2012">Vegas (2012)</a></em> Sheriff Lamb establishes himself as a badass by throwing a suspect through a window in downtown Las Vegas (as indicated by the establishing shot of the Golden Nugget). However, the suspect lands near the sign for the Stardust, several miles away on the Las Vegas strip. It's probably best not to wonder why the casino even has windows on the ground floor in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> was notorious for getting various details about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio">Ohio</a> wrong. For instance, almost all the towns mentioned in the show are real places, and none of them are anywhere near each other even though characters leisurely travel from one town to the next all the time. The show is mainly set in Lima near the Indiana border; rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline is based in Akron, 154 miles away on the opposite end of the state. Then there are the boys from Dalton Academy in Westerville, a suburb of Columbus and 90 miles from Lima. The show implies that all these places are a short drive from each other rather than the all-day trip that they actually are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em>, set in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and filmed in Los Angeles, frequently shows palm trees and LA's surrounding mountains in the background in exterior shots (the title sequence is actual footage of Scranton, filmed by John Krasinski, and the show is actually quite faithful to the location otherwise).
<ul><li> In the episode <em>Employee Transfer</em>, the fact that Nashua is a seven hour drive from Scranton is a major factor in Michael and Holly's breakup, but Nashua is barely a five hour drive from Scranton, seven hours will get you all the way to Augusta, Maine, which becomes doubly amusing when they arrive at the halfway point (four hours) and it's an overgrown forest, whereas halfway between them would put the driver in the middle of Connecticut (Danbury is roughly halfway between Scranton and Nashua) and four hours would be nearly to Boston. Notable for the fact that the Office is usually pretty good about driving times.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER">ER</a></em> has a rather nebulous idea of the location of Cook County Hospital. Some exterior shots place it near the Chicago River where it intersects with Michigan Avenue. Others have it well south of the Loop. And the actual hospital is on the West Side, miles away from either location.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WizardsOfWaverlyPlace">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em>
<ul><li> Most things regarding New York locations. For example, in the episode with a flying carpet, they are badly superimposed over Manhattan, where they see Shea Stadium. Shea Stadium, when it existed, was very much in Queens.
</li><li> Not only that Waverly Place itself is about a two block street just off Washington Square by NYU, at least the portion that is east of Washington Square Park, and this portion is definitely nothing like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoCalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoCalization">SoCal-icized</a> location shown. It does continue west of the park, however, for several blocks well into the West Village, and the set depicted on the show appears to be a somewhat plausible fictionalization of Waverly Place in the West Village. Not overly so, but at the very least, it's probably intended that the Russos live on Waverly Place somewhere in the West Village, as opposed to the eastern portion of it, which in reality is bounded by nothing but NYU buildings and one or two non-NYU apartment buildings.
</li><li> The most egregious error regarding the actual depiction of Waverly Place is that it's shown as a pedestrian mall/walkway, complete with a <em>staircase</em> in the middle of it just before the entrance to the Waverly Sub Station. The real Waverly Place is a major thoroughfare for car traffic, like any other major street in a large city. Such a blatant error was probably done to make the set more friendly for television production.
</li><li> Additionally, the area surrounding the baseball field in the episode "The Supernatural" has a little too much fauna (and not exactly specific to Downstate New York) to be located anywhere in the five boroughs.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderSheWrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></em> referred to a character coming from someplace "twenty miles east of Sheboygan, Wisconsin." Which would place it in the middle of Lake Michigan. And no, there are no inhabited islands in the vicinity. (There is a Cheboygan—pronounced the same—MICHIGAN, almost directly opposite from the Wisconsin town. Perhaps the writers were confused by that.)
<ul><li> Doesn't help. 20 miles east of there would still be underwater, just in Lake Huron instead.
</li></ul></li><li> In the San Francisco season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRealWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheRealWorld">The Real World</a></em>, two of the housemates fly into Nashville and (apparently) rent a car to pick up Jon, who lived in Owensboro, Kentucky, so they can go to SF together. However, the next shot, shown before they get to Jon's house, makes no sense to anyone familiar with the geography of the western end of the state. The shot shows a sign on westbound Interstate 24 near Eddyville. Take your pick:
<ul><li> They took the wrong road out of Nashville, sending them northwest toward <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StLouis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StLouis">St. Louis</a>, with Owensboro about 100 miles north<em>east</em> of their then-current location.
</li><li> The shot was taken while they were on their way from Owensboro to SF — which makes even less sense, as anyone who would plan on taking that trip would almost certainly start by crossing the Ohio River into Indiana and then picking up I-64.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> is a regular offender with, e.g. characters driving from Washington, DC to New York City in under three hours.
<ul><li> In the episode "Ghouli," allegedly set in Norfolk, Virginia, a major port city, a few scenes show mountains on the horizon. The nearest mountain range, the Blue Ridge (part of the Appalachian chain), is inland, halfway across the state.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastWeekTonightWithJohnOliver">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>, in which John mentions a country, saying "a country you think about so little...", and then revealing that the map graphic he's using is highlighting the wrong country (exposing the viewers' unfamiliarity with such countries).

</li><li> The joke is repeated with Bolivia in the next week's segment on judicial elections, highlighting two wrong countries before moving to the right one and lampshading that it will always be funny.

It causes the occasional slip-up, like:
<ul><li> The warehouse where Matt holes up with Vladimir in "Condemned" is said to be at the northwest corner of 47th Street and 12th Avenue. That would be impossible as 12th Avenue at Hell's Kitchen is the West Side Highway, as opposed to a regular street. On the opposite side of the street from the buildings is the USS <em>Intrepid</em> Museum, which is not visible in any shots. The West Side Highway is also eight lanes at this point, not a two-lane road with buildings on both sides. This part of Hell's Kitchen is also primarily residential buildings, and no industrial warehouses.
</li><li> "Bang" opens with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkAndTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkAndTalk">Walk and Talk</a> of Matt and Foggy walking to work, ostensibly in Hell's Kitchen. However, a street sign for East 116th Street appears in the background, betraying the Upper East Side filming location.
</li><li> The location of Karen's hometown Fagan Corners, Vermont is never stated. The newspaper article on her brother's death in "Seven Minutes in Heaven" reports that he<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19qll4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19qll4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19qll4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">actually Karen. Kevin was riding shotgun</span> had been "heading east on Vermont Route 12 from the Hill Road exit ramp off Interstate 89". Vermont Route 12 is a north-south highway that runs parallel to Interstate 89 for much of its length, with the two highways only crossing at the state capital in Montpelier. There's also no direct off-ramp between VT-12 and I-89. There also is no Windler County in Vermont, as Montpelier is in Washington County. Some of this could be justified by the fact that Fagan Corners is a fictional town.
</li><li> Early in "Into the Ring," Foggy meets with Sgt. Brett Mahoney as Brett emerges from what is supposed to be the 50th Street station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line. The entrance signage on the stairwell is accurate, but the landscape of the surrounding buildings isn't. The area around 50th Street and Eighth Avenue in the show is depicted as low-rises that don't exceed five stories at most. In reality, this stretch of Eighth Avenue is primarily composed of highrises exceeding 20 stories. That is actually the entrance to Bedford Avenue on the BMT Canarsie Line with the real signs being temporarily replaced.
</li><li> In one episode, Matt tells Elektra that he's never been north of 116th street. Considering he has a degree from Columbia Law, he has to have been, at some point, at least a few hundred feet north of 116th Street.

They end up on the subway platform for Lower East Side — Second Avenue on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, which is a few miles and several stops away on the Lower East Side, and which is clearly being filmed on the PATH platforms at 33rd Street.

There's also a district in downtown called the "Near East Side", north of the Chicago River and east of Michigan Avenue. The songwriters (who, like Paper Lace, are British) said in interviews — most notably on <em>Beat-Club</em> shortly after the song's smash success — that they had never been to Chicago before that time, and that their knowledge of the city and that period of its history had been based on gangster films.

Saskatchewan is actually considered a prairie province and definitely isn't covered in ice. This, however, is making fun of people who think that all of Canada is a frozen wasteland as if the Great Plains stopped at the US-Canadian border for some reason...
</li><li> In the song "Uneasy Rider", Charlie Daniels sings about his left rear tire being "about ready to go" just as he crosses the Mississippi line on his way to Los Angeles. He limps along the shoulder until he gets to a bar in Jackson. This doesn't make sense no matter how hard you squint. If he had started in Nashville, Tennessee, or Muscle Shoals, Alabama, his best route would be I-40 through Memphis, not I-20 through Jackson. If he'd started in Atlanta, Georgia, then I-20 does make sense, but then he wouldn't go through Arkansas at all. In any case, he was really pushing his luck to drive on a bad tire and on the rim to Jackson — it's at least 130 miles from <em>any</em> "Mississippi line".
</li><li> There's still lots of debate over the chorus of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson">Robert Johnson</a> blues classic "Sweet Home Chicago": "Oh, baby don't you wanna go?/Back to the land of California/To my sweet home, Chicago." The consensus is that this wasn't a mistake on Johnson's part, but there are endless guesses as to why he wrote it that way. The song's supposed to be about a road trip from California to Chicago. Or he was combining two places that people in the Mississippi Delta wanted to move to. Or the song's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> doesn't know that Chicago isn't in California. Or Johnson was giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to friends/relatives who lived in the small California towns of Chicago Park or Port Chicago.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pavement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pavement">Pavement</a>'s "Box Elder" has the line "I'm gonna head to Box Elder, M.O." There are a few places in the United States called Box Elder, but none are in Missouri, the state with the post office abbreviation of MO; the band most likely meant to refer to Box Elder, Montana, which would be "Box Elder, M.T."
</li><li> Dan Fogelberg's "Run for the Roses", about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HorseRacing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HorseRacing">Kentucky Derby</a>, begins with the lines "Born in the valleys/And raised in the trees/Of western Kentucky..." Although Kentucky is indeed the epicenter of the American Thoroughbred industry, the horse farms are mostly around Lexington, locally considered to be in <em>Central</em> Kentucky, and far removed from anything that anyone from Kentucky would call "Western".
</li><li> "Rollin' Home" by Pirates of the Mississippi: "Picked up a load in San Angelene / Dropped a transmission down in New Orleans". There is no place anywhere in the world called "San Angelene".

Given that MC Vagina is a moron, it would probably be easier to list the stuff he gets <em>right</em>.
</li><li> Invoked by "Jack" to yank his friend's chain in the opening dialogue of the Arrogant Worms' "Bitchin' Camaro", when Jack claims his parents drove his new car (the titular Camaro) up from <em>the Bahamas</em> for him.
</li><li> In Jason Derulo's hit "Talk Dirty", he sings about how he's been all over the world and doesn't need to speak the local tongue to flirt with women. However, half of the places he name-drops are predominantly English-speaking (New York and London), and one of them has English as a required academic subject from age 8 onwards, with many schoolchildren starting to learn it much earlier (Taiwan).
</li><li> "Michael Row the Boat Ashore" has the line "[the] River Jordan is deep and wide". Today's River Jordan is neither of these things.
</li><li> Invoked in "Wagon Wheel", originally recorded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OldCrowMedicineShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OldCrowMedicineShow">Old Crow Medicine Show</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Covered Up</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DariusRucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DariusRucker">Darius Rucker</a>. When Ketch Secor wrote the lyrics, he knew that "west from the Cumberland Gap to Johnson City, Tennessee" was wrong (one would head <em>east</em> through said gap to get to Johnson City), but left it anyway because he thought "west" sounded better. (Although why he didn't just swap "to" and "from"...)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisTritt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TravisTritt">Travis Tritt</a>'s "Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde" also gets geography wrong regarding Johnson City. The song begins in that city, while the chorus has the line "It's a long way to Richmond, rolling north on 95". Interstate 26 is the main freeway through Johnson City (although at the time of the song's recording, it was part of Interstate 181, which ended south of town), and the most direct route to Richmond would be via Interstates 81 and 64. While I-95 <em>does</em> travel through Richmond, going from Johnson City to Richmond using I-95 would first require one to travel south to Asheville (again, keeping in mind that I-26 between Johnson City and Asheville had not yet been completed at the time of the song's writing) and then cut all the way across North Carolina on I-40.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Alabama">Alabama</a>'s music video for "Tar Top" shows an Interstate 40 shield with the state name of Alabama on it (at the time, many Interstate shields bore the name of the state through which the highway ran). I-40 never runs through Alabama at any point.
</li><li> "Hazard" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardMarx">Richard Marx</a> is set in Hazard, Nebraska, because he liked the name, but the real Hazard is just a village, not the town depicted in the song, and doesn't have a river.

(this line would subsequently become the title for an expanded reissue of the EP). Ireland is not even part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UnitedKingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and has <em>never</em> been part of England.
</li><li> "The Last Saskatchewan Pirate" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheArrogantWorms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheArrogantWorms">The Arrogant Worms</a> talks about a pirate on the Saskatchewan River, but also refers to "Regina's mighty shores," implying that the river flows through the city; it doesn't even come close.

Since the song is mainly about the improbable design of a ship the exact size and shape of Arkansas, this was probably just meant to add further absurdity to the premise.

<h2>Multiple Sports</h2>
<ul><li> Dallas' sports teams have it crazy.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">Dallas Cowboys</a> are in the NFC East with all Northeast teams, the closest of whom (the Washington Redskins) is more than 1200 miles away — 9 out 12 other teams in the Conference are closer than that. This was insisted upon during the latest NFL realignment in 2002 in order to preserve long-time rivalries.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueBaseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueBaseball">Texas Rangers</a> were in a division consisting of all West Coast teams until the Houston Astros were moved in 2013.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">Dallas Stars</a> were in the Pacific Division along with teams in California and Arizona between 1998 and 2013, until they were realigned (back) into the Central Division with teams in the same time zone (plus the Colorado Avalanche).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">Dallas Mavericks</a> get to be in a division with two other Texas teams, one in New Orleans, and one in Memphis.
</li></ul></li><li> Many American pro sports teams are not based in the cities they represent, but bordering suburbs. Justified to some extent as they're representing the metropolitan area as a whole, not just the city itself.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a> has several examples. The Washington Redskins currently play at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, and have their offices and practice facilities in northern Virginia. The New York Giants and New York Jets don't play in New York (the city OR the state) unless they're playing the Buffalo Bills on the road; their shared home ground at MetLife Stadium is in East Rutherford, New Jersey (this has led combative New Jersey governor Chris Christie to refer to the Jets as the "Jersey Jets" on at least one occasion). And, on top of that, both also have their offices and practice facilities in New Jersey. The Buffalo Bills play in the suburb of Orchard Park. The Miami Dolphins do play in a city with the word "Miami", but it's Miami Gardens. With the opening of their new stadium, the San Francisco 49ers now play in Santa Clara, which is closer to San Jose than it is to San Francisco. The Dallas Cowboys haven't played in the Big D itself ever since they left the Cotton Bowl in 1971 (Texas Stadium was in Irving, the current one is in Arlington).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueSoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueSoccer">Major League Soccer</a> has nearly as many examples as the NFL. The New York Red Bulls, like the Giants and Jets, play in New Jersey but have their own home stadium in Harrison. The Philadelphia Union play in Chester, Pennsylvania. FC Dallas plays in Frisco, the LA Galaxy in Carson, and Real Salt Lake in Sandy (although in the latter case, "Salt Lake" could refer to Great Salt Lake, Salt Lake City, or both). Sporting Kansas City technically averts the trope, since they do play in Kansas City, although the soccer club plays in <em>Kansas</em> whereas most pro teams in KC play in the larger Missouri city.
</li><li> Finally averted by the team now known as the Arizona Coyotes in the 2014 offseason. They had been playing as the Phoenix Coyotes in the suburb of Glendale since December 2003. (The Coyotes had played in Phoenix from 1996, when they arrived from Winnipeg, until moving to Glendale.)
</li><li> Speaking of the NHL, they've pretty much completely averted this trope. Now that the Coyotes have rebranded themselves as an Arizona team, there's not a single team in the league that bears a city name that plays outside its namesake city. The only other teams that play in unmistakably suburban cities either bear the city's name (Anaheim Ducks) or are named for their region (Florida Panthers, who play in the MiamiFort Lauderdale suburb of Sunrise).
</li><li> Zig-zagged by two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">NBA</a> teams:
<ul><li> The Cleveland Cavaliers originally played in the Cleveland Arena until it was torn down in 1974, then they played in Richfield, almost an hour south, for 20 years. However, Gund Arena (now Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse) was built in downtown Cleveland in 1994, and the Cavs have been playing in Cleveland proper ever since.
</li><li> The Detroit Pistons played in the city of Detroit from their arrival in 1957 until moving to the Pontiac Silverdome in 1978. From there, they went to The Palace of Auburn Hills in 1988.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24sw8b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24sw8b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24sw8b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They did play one 1984 home game in the city of Detroit due to a scheduling conflict, and in the 198485 season played 16 games in the city after the Silverdome's inflatable roof collapsed.</span> They returned to Detroit proper in 2017, sharing Little Caesars Arena with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHockeyLeague">Red Wings</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Also zig-zagged by the San Jose Earthquakes of MLS. They started out playing at Spartan Stadium (now CEFCU Stadium) on the campus of San Jose State University. After the 2005 season, the team left for Houston (becoming the Dynamo), but left their history behind for a new ownership group that emerged in 2007. When the Quakes resumed playing in 2008, they played most of their home games in Santa Clara, with occasional big games in other Bay Area cities, but none in San Jose proper. Finally, in 2015, they returned to their namesake city with the opening of Earthquakes Stadium.
</li><li> The Atlanta Braves' 2017 move to the Cobb County venue now known as Truist Park played with the trope. While the Braves no longer play within the city limits, the new stadium has an Atlanta address. Not due to any shenanigans by the Braves; it's simply that the part of Cobb County that's home to the stadium is next to the city of Atlanta and has always been served by an Atlanta post office, since Cumberland is presently not a formally incorporated city.
</li></ul></li><li> American sportscasters love to refer to cities either by cliched nicknames that very few locals actually use ("Beantown" for Boston, "Frisco" for San Francisco) or by famous areas of the city that are nowhere near the actual venues used by pro sports teams. One of those, "South Beach" for Miami, was popularized by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeBronJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LeBronJames">LeBron James</a>, even though the arena the Miami Heat play in is actually located on the <em>other</em> side of Biscayne Bay from South Beach. It also gets applied to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">Marlins</a> (who play even further inland) and the Dolphins (who play many miles northwest in Miami Gardens). Similarly, no Los Angeles pro teams actually play in Hollywood.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OlympicGames">Olympic Games</a> are awarded to a city. Despite this, there are usually some events - usually Association Football and Sailing - that take part many miles away from the host city. This is justified, though, by the football stadia needing to be above a certain capacity (which the host city rarely has) and that sailing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">needs a decent expanse of water</a>, and the host city is rarely a coastal city.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>American Football</h2>
<ul><li> The NFL, up until the 2002 realignment, was an exercise in geographical insanity. Of the five teams in the NFC West division in 2001, three of them (New Orleans Saints, Atlanta Falcons, Carolina Panthers) were <em>Southern cities</em> while the Arizona Cardinals of the NFC <em>East</em> were the westernmost team in the NFC after the San Francisco 49ers. There are still a few oddities present today (the Indianapolis Colts of the AFC South are farther north than the Baltimore Ravens of the AFC North; also, prior to the Los Angeles Rams' re-relocation from St. Louis, they were east of the NFC East's Dallas Cowboys but in the NFC West), but for the most part, the current alignment makes a lot more sense.
<ul><li> <em>Somewhat</em> justified, as the Cardinals had moved from St. Louis in the late '80s, and when the Panthers came into existence in 1995, the NFC West had an open spot, having only four teams to the other divisions' five. And when the AFL and NFL merged, the new NFC alignment <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%93NFL_merger#The_merger_agreement">was drawn out of a hat.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Cowboys remain in the NFC East solely because of their longtime rivalries with the Washington Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles.
</li><li> NFL geography has been somewhat jacked up since 1953, with the Baltimore Colts joining the Western Conference. It got worse with the 1967 realignment into four divisions, with teams going all over the place. Oddly enough, one 1967 division remains intact (and geographically reasonable) to this day: the Central Division, which became the NFC Central, and since 2002 has been the NFC North. The division has had Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, and Minnesota the entire time (adding Tampa Bay from 1977-2001).
</li></ul></li><li> The Carolina Panthers are considered a regional franchise, representing both North and South Carolina<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25yvky');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25yvky" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25yvky');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">They play at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. Portions of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_metropolitan_area">Charlotte Metropolitan Area<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> extend into South Carolina, the Panthers hold their training camp in Spartanburg, South Carolina on the campus of Wofford College (of which the Panthers' founding owner Jerry Richardson is an alumnus), and the team played their first season at Clemson University in the South Carolina city of the same name</span>. One time, Nike accidentally printed T-shirts <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/blog/eye-on-football/22744089/nike-yanks-geographically-incorrect-nc-panthers-shirt">with South Carolina identified as North Carolina<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Association Football</h2>
<ul><li> Despite having Grimsby in their name, Grimsby Town actually play their home games in the neighbouring town of Cleethorpes and have done so since 1899.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">FIFA</a> and its affiliates have a few.
<ul><li> Australia was tired of winning the Oceania qualifiers only to lose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">The World Cup</a> playoff, so they moved to the Asian confederation.
</li><li> Kazakhstan is also in Asia but switched from the AFC to UEFA in 2002.
</li><li> Given that Suriname and Guyana are already odd countries in South America and culturally identify closer to the Caribbean (plus the other teams are much stronger), they play in the North/Central America zone. French Guyana is also a member of CONCACAF, but not FIFA as they are still part of France (thus they can't go to the World Cup).
</li><li> As many of the Asian members refuse to acknowledge the existence of Israel, they play the European qualifiers instead in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup">FIFA World Cup</a>. The winner of the 1958 CAF/AFC (Africa and Asia) qualifier for the FIFA World Cup, for example, was Wales, which decidedly is not in either of those continents, as everyone else in the final round had refused to play Israel and thus a European runner-up was brought in instead, as FIFA refused to allow a country other than the host and defending champions to qualify without playing a match.
</li></ul></li><li> The famous blunder of soccer player Andreas Möller when asked about his new team: Milan or Madrid as long it's Italy (it's the former, by the way).
</li><li> The New Saints, the most successful football club in the Welsh Premier League, are based in Oswestry, which is near the Welsh border, but definitely in England. It turns out that this arrangement is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>in 2003, Oswestry's former club, Oswestry Town, voted to merge into TNS. The merged club chose to play at Oswestry's larger ground. Making it even more justified is that Oswestry Town, despite its English location, had long played in the Welsh league system.
<ul><li> On a similar note, six Welsh clubs - Cardiff City, Colwyn Bay, Merthyr Town, Newport County, Swansea City and Wrexham - play in the English leagues (Cardiff and Swansea both competed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague">English Premier League</a> in the 2010s). Teams from counties on the English side of the England/Wales border also used to be allowed to take part in the Welsh Cup<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note267jge');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note267jge" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note267jge');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although, in the event of one winning, they werent allowed to enter the European Cup Winners Cup; that place went to the best placed Welsh team</span>. This stopped happening in 1996, when the Welsh FA banned them from taking part.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the football tournaments in England and Wales is the EFL Trophy, which is currently open to teams from Leagues One and Two and is further divided into Northern and Southern Sections. It is not unknown for Cambridge United to be placed in the Northern Section and Peterborough United in the Southern Section — despite Peterborough being north of Cambridge.
<ul><li> Scotland has a similar competition to this, which, since the 2018/19 competition, has featured eight guest teams - two each from England, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Wales.
</li></ul></li><li> The Copa América is a 12-team competition consisting of the CONMEBOL<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note27kxth');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note27kxth" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note27kxth');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the South American football confederation</span>. As there are 10 members, it follows that the other two countries are from outside South America. Prior to 2019, all invitees were from North America with one of them always being Mexico; since then, every invited team has been Asian or Australia, straining the definition of "América."
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Baseball</h2>
<ul><li> The annual championship series of North American-based Major League Baseball played since 1903 between the American League (AL) champion team and the National League (NL) champion is called "The World Series" — though in fact one or two places other than the United States and Canada exist in the world, and some of them even play baseball. Averted by Little League Baseball, whose World Series tournaments all feature teams from around the world.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28cds5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note28cds5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28cds5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the flagship tournament, the Little League World Series (for players 12 and under), 16 teams play. Eight are U.S. regional champions. Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Australia send national champions. The lineup is filled out with four larger regionsthe Caribbean (restricted to islands in that area), Latin America (apart from Mexico and the Caribbean), Europe and Africa, and AsiaPacific and Middle East (excluding Japan and Australia).</span>
</li><li> From 1969 until Major League Baseball expanded and reorganized divisions in 1994, the Cincinnati Reds and the Atlanta Braves were in the National League West division, while the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs were in the NL East. This was solely to ensure the Cubs and Cardinals were in the same division due to their rivalry. Why they couldn't have both gone to the West and made things much easier is anyone's guess — the stated reason was that the Cubs and Cardinals, by being placed in the NL East, would get more games against the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Mets, which would result in a more lucrative schedule (whether that meant more fan interest against the big cities of the Northeast where baseball was most strongly-rooted or an easier schedule in a division with a Phillies team whose history is dearth of success (at that point, the Phillies had won two NL pennants and zero World Series in 81 years of play) and a seven-year-old Mets team whose best finish up to then was 9th place out of 10 is not clear — it could be both). Outside of that, the league also had competitive balance concerns about placing the top three NL teams from the 1968 season (the Cubs, Cardinals, and San Francisco Giants) in the same division (only division winners played postseason baseball — the Wild Card would first be used in 1995).
</li><li> Here's a fun one from Major League Baseball: the Angels started off as the Los Angeles Angels (named after the city itself) and actually played in Los Angeles. Just before moving to a newly constructed stadium in the suburb of Anaheim, they changed their name to the California Angels, which was less specific but had the advantage of being true for both the remainder of their time in LA and after the move to Anaheim. But then Disney bought the team and extensively renovated the stadium, with the City of Anaheim putting up some of the funding ... and contractually obligating the Angels to incorporate the city name in the team name. So they became the Anaheim Angels. Then a new owner realized Los Angeles was a <em>much</em> bigger market and the team was renamed the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, honoring the contract in the letter if not in the spirit. That's still the official name, though in practice they're generally just called the Los Angeles Angels.
</li><li> In 2015, the official T-shirts for MLB's division champions included a silhouette of the team's home city skyline printed on the front. The AL West Champion Texas Rangers received shirts with the Dallas skyline printed on them. This did NOT go over well with the people of Arlington, where the team has played since moving to Texas in 1972; such a snit was raised that MLB chose not to make any more shirts after the original shipment.
</li><li> In 2018, the Augusta Greenjackets of the Single-A South Atlantic League moved into a new ballpark in North Augusta, South Carolina, a suburb directly across the Savannah River from downtown Augusta, Georgia.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Basketball</h2>
<ul><li> In his first press conference after being drafted by the Utah Jazz, Karl Malone told the Salt Lake City media how happy he was to be in "the city of Utah".
</li><li> When the Dallas Mavericks faced the Utah Jazz in the 2001 NBA playoffs (the Mavs' first playoff in 11 years), Dirk Nowitzki caught flak for saying how Dallas was going to the "city of Utah". True, Nowitzki is German, but he'd been in the league three years at that point and the Mavs and Jazz were in the same division at the time.
</li><li> The Big East Conference, which was originally comprised of all Northeast schools, really went to hell with this after the turn of the century. In an attempt to expand their base (and status as a football conference), they added the University of Louisville, Cincinnati, Chicago's DePaul University and others to make up for the departing Boston College and University of Miami, then they started going after Texas teams like TCU (who eventually went to the Big 12 instead), SMU and the University of Houston and even further west with Boise State and San Diego State (both of which ended up staying in the Mountain West Conference). They had enough teams to make East and West Divisions and put Philadelphia's Temple University in the West while Louisville and Cincinnati were in the East. All this led to longtime members West Virginia, Syracuse, and Pittsburgh bolting for other conferences, and then seven schools in the conference (dubbed the "Catholic 7"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note29nfdx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note29nfdx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note29nfdx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> four of them are the Founding Schools of the Big East Conference in 1979 </span> due to them sharing that denomination) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">got fed up</a> in 2012 and all left to form their own conference altogether, winning the rights to the Big East name in the process.
</li><li> As for the conference that the Catholic 7 left behind, which became the American Athletic Conference, they're playing with the trope. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy">Navy</a> joining the league for football only in 2015, they split into East and West divisions for that sport and started playing a conference championship game. Navy specifically asked to be in the new West Division, despite being located on the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. (Since Navy has a national following and also uses its national schedule as a recruiting tool for the future Navy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Marine</a> officers it trains, geography isn't as big a factor for them as it is for most other schools.)
</li><li> Speaking of Syracuse and Pittsburgh, in the midst of the conference realignment, both schools settled in the Atlantic Coast Conference, which, as the name suggests, is a conference that consists of schools near the Atlantic coast of the US. While New York, the state that Syracuse is in, is on the Atlantic coast, Pittsburgh is on the wrong side of the Appalachians from that coast. Adding to the madness are the more recent ACC additions Louisville and Notre Dame. Even if one stretched the definitions of Atlantic and coastal, neither school's location (central Kentucky and Indiana, respectively) in the conference makes sense geographically.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Hockey</h2>
<ul><li> The NHL had quite a bit of it once changed into Western and Eastern conferences: the Pacific Division had Phoenix (like in the eponymous NBA division, where the Suns are the only non-California team), and Dallas, <a class="urllink" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1478230-nhl-realignment-problems-that-must-be-solved-and-mistakes-that-must-be-avoided/page/4">closer to most eastern teams than California<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; and the Columbus Blue Jackets was also in the Western Conference (Detroit being the West was justified by both its location and the rivalry with Chicago). Then came <a class="urllink" href="http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/000/765/132/img21767981_original_original_original.jpg?1363329751">the realignment<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where a division consisting mostly of Northeastern US/Canada teams has also the Florida ones (though at least it's been renamed from the "Northeast" to "Atlantic" Division...<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note307jlr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note307jlr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note307jlr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which many complained was also a misnomer: Boston and Florida border the ocean, but most are instead around the Great Lakes — Buffalo, Detroit, Montreal, Ottawa, and Toronto — while Tampa Bay is near the Gulf of Mexico</span> which forced the hitherto "Atlantic" Division to be renamed the "Metropolitan".).
<ul><li> Their woes began from the very moment they expanded beyond the "Original Six" teams. To make sure people would tune in to the Stanley Cup—and to guarantee an O6 team would be in said finals—the Eastern Conference was composed of Boston, Toronto, Montreal, Chicago, New York, and Detroit, and the Western Conference was Oakland, Los Angeles, Minnesota, St. Louis...and <em>Pittsburgh and Philadelphia</em>, two cities that are further east than some of the Eastern Conference teams.
</li></ul></li><li> Two teams in the minor league ECHL, the Atlanta Gladiators and Kansas City Mavericks, do not play in their namesake cities. The Gladiators play in Duluth, Georgia whereas the Mavericks play in Independence, Missouri. The two teams originally averted the trope, originally named the Gwinnett Gladiators and Missouri Mavericks respectively; the two changed their region identity to reflect the metropolitan areas they play in.
</li></ul><p></p><h2>Auto racing</h2>
<dl><dd><ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> track known as the Charlotte Motor Speedway is not in Charlotte, North Carolina, but instead in Concord. which is not even in the same county as Charlotte. Its location in Cabarrus County puts it just across the county line from Mecklenburg County, the county that contains Charlotte. Not only that, but the Charlotte city limits are only a few miles away. As Charlotte is by far the more well-known city, well...
</li><li> Similarly, the Milwaukee Mile is neither located in the city of Milwaukee (although West Allis, where the track is actually located, is still in Milwaukee County) nor is it a true mile.
</li><li> Indianapolis Motor Speedway is not located in Indianapolis, Indiana proper, but an enclave within the city known as Speedway. Given that the city of Speedway is <em>surrounded</em> by the city of Indianapolis, this example splits hairs somewhat.
</li><li> Talladega Superspeedway is a lot closer to Lincoln, Alabama and Interstate 20 than it is to the town of Talladega, Alabama. Its name still makes sense as it is located in Talladega County.
</li><li> Atlanta Motor Speedway is not in Atlanta, Georgia, but in the town of Hampton in Henry County, two counties away from Fulton County where Atlanta is located. Henry County is still part of the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, so the name still fits.

Still:
<ul><li> One supplement infamously placed Oxford within easy walking distance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritainIsOnlyLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritainIsOnlyLondon">central London</a>, despite being nearly 60 miles away.
</li><li> Auckland is located in Australia — and Australia's capital is Sydney.
</li><li> New Orleans apparently has a subway system. Near the Gulf Coast. Below sea level. To put things in perspective, most houses in southern Louisiana lack basements precisely because they'd become indoor pools before long.
</li><li> No one lives between Vancouver (Canada) and the Rocky Mountains, which is weird considering how much of that space would be great for farming, mining or logging.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em> somewhat esoterically treats Europe (and the American seaboards) this way in its Vampire installment. It's explained that vampires don't want to risk driving even to the nearest city from their own, because it might end up with them stranded with not enough time to make it back to their own city. This makes sense in the middle of the US or Canada, where it can take hours to drive to the city limits of the nearest city and more to drive to the centre and the same amount of time back. In Europe and along the coast, few cities outside Scandinavia are more than an hour from their nearest neighbours.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Lexicon</em>, the geography volume of Bard Games' Atlantean Trilogy, can be forgiven for re-drawing the map of Earth to make their ancient civilizations more interesting. However, referring to salt-water straits as "rivers" merely because they're wet and narrow would surely have been a boo-boo even in the Second Age of Atlantis!
</li><li> As pictured above, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Risk">Risk</a> redefines the borders of many countries by incorporating smaller ones into their larger neighbors or by grouping them together to form geographic regions in order to simplify the game and to make the map more legible. However, the game mistakenly refers to one region in Central Asia as "Afghanistan" despite not incorporating the country at all; it's instead a part of the neighbouring "India" region.
<ul><li> Interestingly, larger countries such as the USA and Russia get broken up into smaller territories. This is likely for the sake of game balance.
</li></ul></li><li> The game <em>Outburst</em> is playing by giving a team a category and seeing how many of the 10 examples of things within that category they can name within a short period of time. Somewhat like <em>Family Feud</em>, but without taking turns. Each card will feature at least one answer that is factually incorrect or just plain off-the-wall, on the basis that someone is likely to say it anyway. One edition had a card listing "Cold Countries", with "Siberia" as one of its answers. Siberia is a region of Russia, not a country unto itself. So a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlobalIgnorance">globally ignorant</a> player who pipes up and gives this response may end up winning the round for their team.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> adventure taking place in Bogotá describes the landlocked mountain city as having a port.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> has been accused of this, accurately and inaccurately.
<ul><li> The Italian Errors — None, actually, as the accusations are based on the accusers' own error.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwoGentlemenOfVerona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwoGentlemenOfVerona">Two Gentlemen of Verona</a></em>, the character of Valentine takes a ship to go to Milan from Verona. In the sixteenth century, Verona and Milan were connected by a canal, allowing Valentine to make his trip by boat to Milan from Verona.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTempest">The Tempest</a></em>, Prospero, Duke of Milan, and Miranda, are put forth from Milan on a "bark", or boat, and are taken "some leagues to sea" to "a rotten carcass of a boat" (Act I, Scene 2). Milan's Grand Canal (Naviglio Grande), still around today, linked Milan to the Ticino river, which in turn empties into the Mediterranean Sea, some leagues away from Milan.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheTamingOfTheShrew">The Taming of the Shrew</a></em>, Tranios father was a sailmaker from land-locked Bergamo. Bergamo is the nearest large city to Lake Iseo and close to Lake Como, creating a Bergamo boat-making and sail-making industry which started long before the 16th century and continues to this day.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em>, Romeo is exiled and goes to Mantua — Mantua is within a reasonable distance of Verona.
</li></ul></li><li> The Bohemian Errors — Shakespeare was actually criticized for them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">while he was still alive</a>, but they depend on what is meant by "Bohemia": is it the original country itself, or the entire kingdom of Bohemia? Also, what exactly is a "desert" to an Elizabethan man?
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale">The Winter's Tale</a></em>, Shakespeare gives Bohemia both a coastline and a vast desert.
</li><li> This was also present in the original text that Shakespeare lifted the plot from, so it may be that Shakespeare doesn't fail geography, he just doesn't check the source material.
</li><li> Originally "desert" simply referred to wilderness rather than the more specific modern definition of a very dry region (usually hot and sandy/rocky), so Bohemia having a "desert" might not be as bad as it sounds. At least to Britons and Americans who think that most of Central Europe consists of steppe.
</li><li> King Ottokar II (r. 125378), King of Bohemia, extended his rule to the Adriatic Sea by inheriting Carinthia and Krain (which however did not become part of the Kingdom of Bohemia) in 1269. As Shakespeare's King Polixenes of Bohemia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheWintersTale">The Winter's Tale</a></em> vaguely parallels the life of King Ottokar II, some think that it is admissible to speak of a "Bohemian coastline" with reference to the tiny part of the Istrian coast that belonged to Krain (most of that coast was Venetian), but it really is only as legitimate as referring to the White Cliffs of Dover as part of the Scottish coast after the accession of James I to the English throne. Not to mention that Ottokar lost Krain as well as his life after a grand total of nine years' possession.
</li><li> The Habsburg ruler Rudolf II (15521612) became king of Croatia and Hungary in 1572, then became king of Bohemia in Germany in 1575 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Emperor</a> in 1576, effectively creating a personal realm with an Adriatic Sea coastline and Bohemia combined. But the Hungarian-Croatian coastline was not regarded as "Bohemian", even if Rudolf did make Prague his main residence.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MeasureForMeasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MeasureForMeasure">Measure for Measure</a></em> is a play with a Duke named Vincentio, his deputy Angelo, a nun named Isabella, her brother Claudio, his lover Juliet, and their friend Lucio... set in <em>Vienna</em>.
<ul><li> It was hardly unusual in Shakespeare's era for noble families to not be ethnically of the country where they were living (nobility from one country routinely married into the nobility of other countries), or to choose names borrowed from a more prestigious language than the one the local common folk were speaking (and in that era the prestige language was Italian). And "Isabella" is an especially weak example: although it is Latinate in origin, it was already a well-known and very common name in German-speaking countries in Shakespeare's day — there had already been several Isabellas in Austria's nobility ranks by the time Shakespeare was even born.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TimonOfAthens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TimonOfAthens">Timon of Athens</a></em>, his description of the Athenian countryside sounds nothing like Greece, but like so many of his other plays depicting foreign parts more like a generic culture with a generic wealthy society.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello">Othello</a></em>, he puts Venice only a day away by sail from Cyprus. Venice is over 1,100 nautical miles (2,000 km) from the Cypriot coast; in Shakespeare's time it could take up to three weeks <em>if</em> the winds were right to sail from one to the other.
<ul><li> Especially bad because in act 1, everyone seems to fully expect Othello to arrive in Cyprus before the Turks do, despite having to travel a much longer distance. Luckily a storm manages to sink all the Turks' ships anyway so it doesn't matter.
</li><li> While the events of the play span three days, they occur in two periods: a time period of one day in Venice leading up to the departure in Act I Scene 3, and then the arrival in Cyprus in Act II Scene 1 starting another time period of two days in Cyprus, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingAtTheSpeedOfPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TravelingAtTheSpeedOfPlot">an unspecified period of time</a> between the two periods. Thus the actual length of the journey between Venice and Cyprus is never specified in the play itself.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Macbeth">Macbeth</a></em>. A witch says she'll keep a woman's ship-captain husband from making port in Aleppo because she wouldn't share her chestnuts. Aleppo is some distance from the sea, located near Euphrates River which empties into the Persian Gulf.
<ul><li> Shakespeare would have had easy access to the account of one Ralph Fitch, who in 1583 set sail on the <em>Tyger</em> bound for Tripoli and Aleppo in Syria. Aleppo's seaport in the late 1500s was located on the nearby Euphrates River. It was a seven-day journey according to Mr. Fitch. Mr. Fitch arrived back in London in 1591, with plenty of time to write <a class="urllink" href="http://www.archive.org/stream/ralphfitchenglan00rylerich/ralphfitchenglan00rylerich_djvu.txt">his description<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> before Shakespeare read it.
</li><li> If Mr. Fitch claimed to have made port at Aleppo, he was either sorely mistaken or lying. The Euphrates flows, in fact, into the Persian Gulf. In order to make port there, a ship from England would have needed to circumnavigate Africa. Furthermore, Aleppo is in fact roughly 50 miles from the banks of the Euphrates, and cannot be said to have a port. It is more probable that Fitch made port at Tripoli, on the coast of the Levant, and subsequently traveled overland to Aleppo.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The final act of Puccini's <em>Manon Lescault</em> is set in the deserts of Louisiana, with the heroine eventually dying of dehydration right outside of New Orleans. (The original novel makes the same mistake.)
<ul><li> As already noted elsewhere on this page, "desert" did not have the same "vast expanse of sand" meaning in the era that <em>Manon Lescaut</em> was written as it does today, but referred to any large tract of wilderness at all. New Orleans was nowhere near as highly urbanized in the 1700s as it is today, so it's hardly an "error" for a person lost in the wilderness to die of dehydration.

At one point, Georges's mother comments on the construction of the Eiffel Tower, across the river from the island, when in reality the tower is more than a mile away and around a large bend in the river.

The most egregious one being the distance between Tombstone's landing site to their objective. The Marines land around the Central Business District located at the mouth of the Singapore River and make their way towards Chinese-controlled Changi International Airport, which in reality it is at least 1215 kilometres east, from the southern tip all the way to the extreme eastern part of the island nation (notwithstanding urban jungle in-between).

</li><li> In <em>World Driver Championship</em> for the N64, one of the tracks is in Sydney, Australia. The start/finish line is at Sydney Airport. Most of the lap runs through the city of Sydney... and then towards the end of the lap, you get off the Sydney Harbour Bridge and find yourself driving through the Barkly Tablelands, in the Northern Territory, before arriving back at the airport. Google Earth approximates a 34-hour drive from one to the other. A good car in the game should be able to do an entire lap in, give or take, 1 minute 40 seconds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OgreBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OgreBattle">Ogre Battle</a></em> has Kastro Valley. According to the town of Almalyk, the Kastro Valley is, quote: "580 baums long, 75 baums wide, and 1.8 baums deep" and a baum is: "the distance an adult walks in 1500 minutes," or 25 hours. Assuming an average speed of three miles an hour, that gives us dimensions of 43,500 miles long, 5,625 miles wide, and 135 miles deep. Assuming an earth-like planet, that's a length nearly twice the circumference and depth enough to go well into the mantle. It's roughly one hundred times the area of the Amazon basin. Dividing the size of a baum by ten still gives us a problematic (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaveable</a> depth) but a much more reasonable, Amazon-basin-sized area.

</li><li> Strangely enough, given that Penn and Teller specifically made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PennAndTellersSmokeAndMirrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PennAndTellersSmokeAndMirrors">Desert Bus</a></em> to be "stupefyingly like reality," the shape and length of the road from Tucson to Las Vegas, while stupefying, are not entirely "like reality." The road is not entirely straight, and it's more than 360 miles long.
</li><li> The map of Europe and North Africa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval II: Total War</a></em> is accurate enough. However, once the player finally acquires the technology to cross the Atlantic they will find that the land on the other side does not match reality at all in either location or scale. It also doesn't help that the turn-based system results in an Atlantic crossing that takes about 20 years of game time.
</li><li> <em>Super Hang-On</em> has you driving on cross-country highways to tour entire continents. Except the highways never have junctions, definitely do not curve in accordance with real-world geography, and are far shorter than what they would be if they were to scale.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OutRun">OutRun</a> 2019</em> has Stage 3, "Around The World", with each route representing a country; the closed network of roads can take you through Sicily, the Mediterranean coast, Hong Kong, Antarctica, and various other corners of the world without your car ever having to ride a ferry or take more than 10 minutes to make the entire trip. Granted, your car can drive up to 692 mph<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31bsqw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31bsqw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31bsqw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in the North American version; other versions of the game alter the units so that it's 692 km/h or 430 km/h</span>, but even at that speed it would still take a few hours at the least just to travel across a modestly-sized country in real life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CriminalCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CriminalCase">Criminal Case</a>: World Edition</em> has a pretty fluid idea about how far the areas are from each other, and takes a lot of liberty to make the player go back and forth between the locations as if they're just a few minutes away when they are not. For example, when the player is told to go to India, they are sent to New Delhi, but the actual crime scene is in the Taj Mahal, which is in Agra — 180 km away from the capital city. And one of the suspects is a kid who offers elephant ride from the 108-feet Hanuman Statue, in Shimla — which is even farther away (557 km from Agra).
</li><li> The original version of Microsoft Train Simulator had six default routes, based on real-life lines, but didn't exactly look like the real world counterparts.
<ul><li> For instance, the original Marias Pass route<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note32e63t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note32e63t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note32e63t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a depiction of the BNSF Hi-Line Subdivision from Shelby to Whitefish, Montana via Marias Pass</span> didn't accurately portray any of the many high trestles on this portion of the route. For instance, Goat's Lick Trestle near Essex is depicted as a small ditch rather than as a high trestle over a ravine. Same goes for the trestle at Java Creek, which is depicted as an ordinary bridge rather than a trestle.
</li><li> Consequently, third-party users have made a point of going in and making modified versions of the default MSTS routes, altering the scenery and tracks to better resemble what actually exists there.
</li></ul></li><li> Notably averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueCrime">True Crime</a></em> games. These games use actual maps of Los Angeles and New York City, so distances between points are roughly accurate. However, locations of actual places in the game? Not so accurate.
</li><li> This is also the case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em>. The maps are completely randomized apart from few specific Council Missions and some DLC missions, and only a handful have small changes depending on location. This means that you may stumble upon a research facility surrounded by a pine forest. In India.
</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, you can't travel to Earth, but you can travel to Earth's moon, where Earth will be visible above the horizon. Although you have to look hard to see through the clouds, once you make out the landmasses it becomes obvious that the image is backwards. The Gulf of Mexico is apparently west of Mexico and east of Florida.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Forza">Forza Horizon 3</a></em> takes some major liberties with Australian geography. For example, Surfers Paradise and Byron Bay are separated by Victoria's Great Ocean Road. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that they are fully aware of the inaccuracies and that it was done in order to fit as many different biomes onto the map as they could.
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>'s story mode, a character drives into Rio De Janeiro on an ATV, picks up two other characters - one of whom is unconscious and presumably dying - and drives off. The next time we see them, they're crashing that same ATV through a window... in <em>London</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> notwithstanding, the obvious implication is that they somehow drove that ATV several thousand miles northeast and across an <em>ocean</em>, and did so fast enough for their incapacitated passenger to be in the exact same state she was in when they left Rio. In a game revolving around superpowered martial artists, this may be the strangest thing that happens, which is saying something.
</li><li> On the map accompanying the Tower Bridge stage of <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pang">Pang</a></em>, Tower Bridge is shown as being somewhere in Lancashire — over 200 miles from London.

However, the defining feature of tundra is permafrost, which prevents trees and tall grass from growing. And while Whiterun doesn't have many trees, they do grow throughout the hold along with tall grass, meaning that it's impossible for the region to be a tundra.
</li><li> Even though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Demonbane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Demonbane">Arkham City</a> is located in Massachusetts according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">the Mythos</a>, it's moved to the west coast in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsUX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsUX">Super Robot Wars UX</a></em> to make crossovers with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Heroman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Heroman">Heroman</a> easier.

Plus, the games frequently get topograhical features wrong, particularly by placing mountains and hills in what is really flatlands, but this was likely to spice up the map and make it more interesting, given that much of the US is notoriously flat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry">Flyover Country</a>.

</li><li> In "30 Minutes Over Tokyo" several Japanese landmarks are depicted being within a short distance of one another.
</li><li> "The Regina Monologues" acts as if the United Kingdom still has the death penalty, which is acted out in a medieval fashion by ordering beheading in The Tower Of London.

This couldn't be further from the truth — not only are there hardly any truly medieval buildings left in Munich, but the Mariensäule is in front of the <em>new</em> Town Hall building <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tropicalisland.de/germany/bavaria/munich/images/MUC%20Munich%20-%20Marienplatz%20with%20Old%20Town%20Hall%20and%20Mariens&lt;!--E4ule--&gt;20or%20column%20of%20the%20Virgin%20Mary%20at%20its%20center%203008x2000.jpg">a hundred meters away from the old one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (and all three buildings are on the central Marienplatz square, not on some intersection), while the Sendlinger Tor is almost an entire kilometer away from the Marienplatz. Obviously, Family Guy's Munich was just a setpiece for yet another '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGermansAreNazis">All Germans Are Nazis</a>' joke. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Some Germans actually took offense to that</a>.
</li><li> <em>Family Guy</em> is also inconsistent in showing the correct shape of Rhode Island, despite the fact the show is set there and its creator went to college in Providence. Some maps <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/familyguy/images/5/5c/Newport.png/">are pretty close to reality<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with only some minor inconsistencies, while others - as in the <em>Animaniacs</em> example above, forget to include islands in Narragansett Bay, annex chunks of Massachusetts or make the <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/familyguy/images/e/e2/Rhode_Island.png">east of the state<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> much bulkier than it actually is.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> animated special <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2009ASDreamland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2009ASDreamland">Dreamland</a></em> opens with an establishing shot of the "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.sfreporter.com/uploads/2009/11/drwho_roswell.JPG">New Mexico Desert, June 13, 1947<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>". Aside from the roadsign itself being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a> (due to neither the style of sign, nor Interstate routes, existing in 1947), it places the (not-yet-existent) I-25 within "35m"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note34j7yk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note34j7yk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note34j7yk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">modern US roadsigns either spell out "MILES" in all-caps, or have no unit indicated as miles are assumed; the lower-case "m" shown is used to indicate <em>meters</em></span> of Roswell. The real-life I-25, built along the path of US Route 85 (which <em>did</em> exist in 1947), runs over a hundred miles west of Roswell.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> has the Mayor give the geographic coordinates of Townsville (the intersection of Lincoln and Main, specifically) as 32 degrees north, 212 degrees west. Degrees of latitude and longitude only go up to 180, but even if you wrap around the globe past that mark, going 212 degrees west of the Prime Meridian puts you in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Japan. Of course, this was likely deliberate to avoid pinpointing any specific place and having to deal with the repercussions of that.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> episode "Uh Oh Canada" depicts Boomhauer meeting up with a French-speaker in Guelph, Ontario, very improbable in real life, and them kayaking with mountains in the background. As anyone who has been to Ontario will tell you, mountains are nowhere to be found in the province, especially not in Guelph.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies">Totally Spies!</a></em> episode "The Getaway" has the spies going to a volcano research lab in Iceland, which is covered in ice and snow, but it's actually Greenland that's covered in ice.
</li><li> In "Friends in the City" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TootAndPuddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TootAndPuddle">Toot &amp; Puddle</a></em>, Toot and Puddle visit the Statue of Liberty on the final boat of the day and observe it amidst a beautiful sky filled with stars. But given the bright lights of New York City, that shouldn't be possible, and the version of New York City that they visit appears to be just as filled with tall buildings that would surely be lit up at night.
</li><li> The episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MisterT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MisterT">Mister T</a></em> entitled "Fortune Cookie Caper" is set in New York City and, apart from it being a strange, alternate-universe New York that has neither traffic nor parallel-parked cars (and where there are rickshaws in its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtlas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodAtlas">Hollywood Atlas</a> Chinatown), the plot relies on street addresses that turn out to be clues. All of the addresses are impossible and would send anyone seeking them deep underwater in either the Hudson or the East River, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheAgonyBooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheAgonyBooth">The Agony Booth</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/Mister_T/Fortune_Cookie_Caper.aspx">had some fun pointing out.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It would be one thing if it were just code, but actual buildings are shown with the addresses in question.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS14E3MedicinalFriedChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS14E3MedicinalFriedChicken">Medicinal Fried Chicken</a>" features Cartman visiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KentuckyFriedChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KentuckyFriedChicken">KFC's</a> original home of Corbin, Kentucky to visit with Colonel Sanders. Corbin, a small town on the western edge of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Appalachia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Appalachia">Appalachia</a>, is depicted as being in a tropical rain forest. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, as the scene parodies a key plot point from the 1983 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983">Scarface</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>: In "Dethwater", Nathan Explosion states he wants to record the new album in the deepest, blackest part of the ocean: the Marianas Trench (near the Marianas Islands in the Pacific Ocean). However on a globe, he points to a spot just southwest of Portugal (almost on the other side of the world).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder23');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder23" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the United States Interstate Highway system, east-west highways are assigned even numbers and north-south highways are assigned odd numbers. This numbering system holds true even if the local direction of the route does not match the compass directions.
<ul><li> Interstate 94 is an east-west highway from Billings, Montana to Huron, Michigan. However, from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Lansing, Illinois (just south of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a>), a distance of about 117 miles, the highway operates on a north-south alignment as it follows the west shore of Lake Michigan. Here, signs for "east"bound I-94 translates to "south", and "west" translates to "north". To a lesser extent, Interstate 94 runs roughly north-south between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit">Detroit</a> and Port Huron, Michigan, though the 22-mile stretch between New Baltimore and Marysville is northeast/southwest.
</li><li> Interstate 90 is this trope through the parts of the Chicago area where it overlaps with Interstate 94 (the Kennedy and Dan Ryan Expressways). In fact, it has a second segment where it operates on a north-south alignment even though it has an east-west designation: from about Portage, Wisconsin to Rockford, Illinois.
</li><li> Interstate 95 is the east coast highway from Maine to Florida. Through Connecticut, though, the highway has more of an east-west routing to follow the north shore of the Long Island Sound.
</li><li> Through Virginia, Interstate 64 runs almost exactly the wrong way in the Hampton Roads region, where sections that once were labeled "east" running almost due west have had these labels removed due to confusion in the Norfolk, Virginia area.
</li><li> While in many cases, this is due to relatively short deviations, compared to the overall routing of the highway, it is not always the case. For example, Interstate 26 from Kingsport, Tennessee to Charleston, South Carolina is labeled east-west as its number suggests, but it carries a more generally north-south routing (the Tennessee portion of the route was originally designated Interstate 181). Interstate 24 from Pulley's Mill, Illinois to Chattanooga, Tennessee by way of Nashville has an east-west designation but a more northwest-southeast routing.
</li><li> Diagonal highways can end up with either an odd or an even number. For instance, there is a 145-mile section of overlap between east-west Interstate 20 (which runs between Kent, Texas and Florence, South Carolina) and north-south Interstate 59 (between Chattanooga, Tennessee and New Orleans, Louisiana) from Meridian, Mississippi to Birmingham, Alabama. The overlap segment runs on a northeast to southwest diagonal.
</li><li> Though on a north-south alignment, Interstate 25 has a 45-mile segment where it runs on a northwest-to-southeast diagonal between Santa Fe and Las Vegas, New Mexico, where it crosses Glorieta Pass.
</li><li> Extra confusion can be had when two highways run concurrently. For example, there is a stretch in Virginia where you can simultaneously drive southbound on I-77 and northbound on I-81.
</li></ul></li><li> Auxiliary Interstate highways can get this trope since the last two digits of their designation come from the parent Interstate highway that they branch off of. Thus, a spur from an even-numbered (east-west) highway can travel north-south (like I-380 in Iowa) or vice-versa.
</li><li> Some interstate highways are located out of their proper place in the Interstate grid. Normally, the Interstate highways increase in number from west to east and south to north. However, exceptions occur:
<ul><li> Interstate 71 is a north-south highway from Cleveland, Ohio to Louisville, Kentucky via Columbus and Cincinnati, Ohio. The Ohio section of the route (which constitutes the majority of the highway's miles) is east of the higher-numbered Interstate 75.
</li><li> Interstate 85 south of Atlanta, Georgia runs west of the lower-numbered Interstate 75.
</li><li> Through the south Chicago suburbs and northwest Indiana west of Lake Station, Interstate 94 is situated to the <em>south</em> of Interstate 90. This is a justified example, as Interstate 90 operates over the entire length of the Indiana Toll Road within Indiana. Originally, I-94 operated over the western part of the Toll Road and the Chicago Skyway and switched to the Borman Expressway at Lake Station, while I-80 and I-90 operated over the Borman Expressway west of there (I-94's current route) and switched to the Toll Road at Lake Station. In 1965, I-90 and I-94 were switched to eliminate the confusion of the three Interstates all switching roads at Lake Station. As a result, I-90 operates entirely on the Toll Road, I-94 stays on the Borman, and I-80 is the only highway to switch between the Borman and the Toll Road.
</li><li> Interstate 99 is a notorious case, as its route number was written into the law that authorized the route's Interstate designation, as opposed to being assigned by AASHTO, even though it runs west of Interstate 81.
</li><li> Long tied up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>, Interstate 69 is a strange case. As the original route was extended through Michigan on freeways already planned as upgrades to the existing US-27 and state routes, the portion between Lansing and Port Huron would actually be <em>signed</em> east-west, with the changeover from north-south coming at the northern end of its concurrency with Interstate 96 (which itself runs north-south for the entirety of its concurrency with I-69, although I-96 remains signed east-west due to the rather short length of the concurrency). The under-construction future route of I-69 from Indianapolis to the Mexican border takes it west of I-65, I-55, and several other lower odd-numbered Interstates in the South.
</li></ul></li><li> Sometimes, you'll see highways that have control cities that they never actually go into. Others omit select control cities.
<ul><li> Interstate 65 is the main highway for travel between Indianapolis and Chicago. As a result, Chicago is the control city on northbound signs north of Indianapolis. However, I-65 doesn't quite go all the way to Chicago. It terminates at Interstate 90 and the Indiana Toll Road in Gary, Indiana, 26 miles southeast of Downtown Chicago, and you have to take the Toll Road to get the rest of the way to Chicago (or take Interstate 94 via the Borman, Bishop Ford, and Dan Ryan Expressways if you'd rather shunpike).
</li><li> Although Interstate 55 does use New Orleans as its southernmost control city, it terminates at Interstate 10 in Laplace, twelve miles and two parishes away from Orleans Parish.
</li><li> North of Baltimore, Maryland, there are some signs on I-95 that use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity">New York City</a> as a control city instead of the closer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> or Wilmington.
</li><li> Interstate 275, a western bypass of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Detroit">Detroit</a>, has a control city of Flint. It is possible to use the route to get to Flint, but this requires going west on I-96 and then north on US-23. It's signed as Flint because the route was originally planned to end at I-75 near Holly, just south of Flint, but the route was never completed due to local opposition.
</li></ul></li><li> Zig-zagged with highway M-123, a highway that runs through the eastern portion of the Upper Peninsula. The route runs north-south from just north of St. Ignace to the small community of Paradise, turns east-west, then turns north-south again to run through the community of Newberry to its final end at M-28. While the signage directions change at Paradise to keep the north-south alignment correct through Newberry, this also means that "north" or "south" M-123 for the leg in between is often times going more east-west.
</li><li> Depending on the state, and sometimes even the highway, the numbering convention for exits on the highways can vary. On those that use sequential exit numbers, Exit 15 means that this is the fifteenth exit on the highway starting at the state line (if you enter the state from the other side, the fifteenth exit you encounter could potentially be Exit 33), while on those that use distance-based exit numbers, Exit 15 is the exit that is found at the mile 15 marker on the highway (again, counting from a state line), and since the next exit is twenty miles away, there is no Exit 16.
</li><li> Map makers make deliberate errors on their maps, putting streets or towns that don't exist on their maps as trap streets, designed to catch people who try to copy them.
