If the two of them wind up getting married, it's even worse — chances are that the Love Interest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowedAtTheWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowedAtTheWedding">won't even make it to the honeymoon, or even through the ceremony!</a> Often a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge">women in refrigerators</a>.

If the show has any amount of spy intrigue, there is at least a 50% chance that the new love interest is working for the other side and/or milking the relationship for intel; on intrigue-heavy shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em>, this probability approaches 100%, and odds are good that the hero will be required to personally contribute to his or her sweetie's demise.

</p><p>The reason for all this romance being cut short (besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroesStaySingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroesStaySingle">an authorial inclination for their heroes to stay single and available</a>) is the fact that many villains just can't resist tormenting the hero however they can, particularly by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo">going after friends, family and loved ones (and even the Team Pet!) of the hero</a>. It's little wonder that many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">Celibate Heroes</a> (who have likely been through this multiple times) have an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">It's Not You, It's My Enemies</a>" speech handy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet">Doom Magnets</a> suffer this by definition, but it isn't limited to romantic relationships — <em>anyone</em> who gets close to them is doomed.

Some authors would rather leave a character to deal with their struggles on their own to show how hardened they are, rather than using love to deal with these issues because they have a sweetheart to go to that can make it all better. However, if the character is enhanced by the presence of their beloved, the opposite can happen, where they really are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>, usually after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">drawn-out period of toying with the idea</a>, and the two go on to have children who have their own challenges ahead of them, thus breaking the curse.
</p><p>In TV series, this is often caused by the closely related trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalAttractor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalAttractor">Fatal Attractor</a> is a variation of this, except that the love interests in question usually survive, but prove to be woefully unsuitable for the hero in some way, if they don't turn out to be bad guys. Sometimes the two of these are combined, making for a character who <em>really</em> can't catch a break in the romantic department.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerHeartWillGoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerHeartWillGoOn">Her Heart Will Go On</a>, a variation where the love interest is killed off to show how strong and empowered a female protagonist is. Expect the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingWidower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingWidower">Crusading Widower</a> to have new potential love interests die to not distract them from their vengeance, or grow disgusted with the edgy nature of the character and ultimately be turned off of him.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a></em> seems to have this problem: all the women he loves either die, are already spoken for or, in one case, change their identity to male after a complete hysterectomy.
</li><li> Lelouch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> has three love interests (the main ones, at least; there are many more). Shirley dies and Kallen tries to kill him. In the end, though, it doesn't matter, because he can't be with any of them anyway. Also Nunnally and Euphemia, who were both childhood crushes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">despite being his sisters.</a> He caused the death of Euphemia and the apparent death of Nunnally. <strong>If</strong> one counts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> Lelouch has with two guys in the series, it's not much better: Rolo is the one who kills Shirley, had plans to off Nunnally <em>and</em> ends up pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> for Lelouch, and for all effects Suzaku has secretly assumed the identity of Zero by the end of the series... while everyone else believes he <em>is</em> dead.

But, after becoming the next Devil Hunter in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassFamily">the Mano Family</a> line, anyone she takes a romantic interest in either dies or ends up possessed by demonkind, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">to ensure she never has children, so she won't be able to continue the bloodline.</a>
</li><li> Jun of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DevilmanLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DevilmanLady">Devilman Lady</a></em> suffers this trope. Only one of her male love interests whom she doesn't end up with is immune.
</li><li> Terry Bogard in the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a></em> suffered from this. His first love interest, Lily McGwire, is killed by his nemesis Geese during the first TV special, while his second love interest, Sulia, ends up sacrificing herself to defeat her brother in the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Motion Picture</a>.

</li><li> Masaru Katou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gantz">Gantz</a></em> has really bad luck with women, as in all the girls that show interest in him tend to die. Might be why he prefers to cultivate his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>, particularly his bonds with his best friend.
</li><li> Shu Ouma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GuiltyCrown">Guilty Crown</a></em>, both of his love interests wounded up dead via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. While he had three, though the third was rather ambiguous and she survived at the end.
</li><li> Almost any woman who falls in love with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> pilot is doomed to die.

She was cut out simply to ease the things a bit. In the Tomino's original novels the character's ended up as Amuro's <em>wife</em> after all.

</li><li> Nor is it even limited to protagonists either, as two of the examples above involve antagonists: Carta Issue and her love interest are both antagonists, while Lalah is simultaneously this for both protagonist Amuro AND antagonist Char.
</li><li> Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Jerid</a>, to whom this happens <em>at least twice in the same series</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em>: Given that the lack of continuity for this series/franchise means that <em>none</em> of the characters ever have a long term relationship, all five characters qualify. In this series, Love Interest means potential corpse. The only exception is Fujiko and Lupin's relationship. This curse is probably the reason Lupin will never get what he wants from her, though.
<ul><li> Jigen stands out from the group as having the highest body count of dead lovers. Not just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>, they're likely to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsDramatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsDramatic">dramatic death scene</a>.

Apart from the survivor, only one of them was still alive at the end of the episode he/she was introduced in. Two of them died shortly after Madlax agreed to go on a date with them, but before the date could actually happen.
</li><li> Likewise, Tsunade of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> also seems to suffer from this, ranging from her brother Nawaki to her lover Dan and finally to Jiraiya.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Anyone who genuinely falls in love with Usagi tends to die a lot. Mamoru/Endymion how many times now (though he always gets better). Prince Diamond/Dimande/Demand. And even Seiya is killed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a>... Seems the only person who ever got spared for liking Usagi even the slightest bit was Umino who later moved on to Usagi's Best Friend in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a>, and filler character Ali/Ail/Alan (but in his case, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">sister/love interest</a> commits a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> in order to save him, so he very nearly missed the mark there...).
</li><li> And to further drive the point home, Mamoru himself also seems to have his share of dead love interests... Usagi/Serenity, Beryl, Fisheye...it just goes on... Lucky for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Usagi and Mamoru</a> that <em>they</em> aren't allowed by the story to <em>stay</em> dead, otherwise they'd have never lasted long enough to actually get together.
</li><li> Ami/Sailor Mercury of the first anime has Urawa (Greg in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiC">DiC</a> English dub), who transfers to Juuban at the start of the episode and moves away by the end. He does get a second appearance for one episode later in the season, where he and Ami actually go on a date, but after the first season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, he's never mentioned again. In the finale, he was only seen as an illusion cast by the enemy to distract Ami and kill her.)

He ends up killing her in a showdown as Joe the Condor being unaware of her identity and is heartbroken when she doesn't show up later for a race they had planned. Just to rub it in further, it is revealed much later in the show that the woman was the fiancee of his priest childhood friend Alan.
<ul><li> Another woman accompanies him on an endurance race in one episode.

And Meliodas will feel inevitable heartbreak ad infinitum as long as the curses prevail. Worse, his sanity is on the decline from the instances where he's been killed, and the last time one of the Elizabeths died, he snapped from all the repeated losses and wiped out an entire kingdom in one massive outburst of rage, leading to his self-imposed branding as the Sin of Wrath.</span>

Shortly after Yoko Littner and Kamina kiss, promising to begin their relationship after the upcoming battle... Kamina dies. In fact, <em>both</em> characters who kiss Yoko die shortly thereafter, though in fairness the second one (Kittan) went on a suicide mission knowing he'd die (Well there is a reason why she is nicknamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Doombitch</a>...)

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean Grey</a> does not count, since the relationship never really got anywhere (despite what some insist), save for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse">Ultimate Universe</a> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em> universe.

To be fair that wasn't his fault, he thought she was Wolverine. She was trying to commit "suicide by cop"; she sneaks up behind him while he's still freaked out from fighting Wolvie. He spider-senses her, and instinctively punches without looking.
</li><li> The secret it seems is to stay away from him for the rest of your life. One comic has Wolverine called by a woman he knew, and fell in love with, 50 years before. They go on a mission together, and several pages later she's lying dead in the wreckage of their plane.
</li><li> It seems every other year, Logan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">discovers</a> another dead Asian wife.

When she was young, her best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DriventoSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DriventoSuicide">was driven to suicide</a> and blamed Alex for it in her suicide note. The girl's mother, in a fit of grief-stricken rage, cursed Alex with something called a Neren Hex at her funeral, which functions as a <em>literal</em> Cartwright Curse. Anything she expresses even the slightest bit of affection for is instantly <em>pulverized.</em> Apparently, she's terrified of getting close to people in case she slips up and something horrible happens to them.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire">Starfire</a> doesn't catch a break in her romantic life since every love interest she had other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Dick Grayson</a> died:
<ul><li> Her first human boyfriend before Dick was an undercover H.I.V.E. agent ordered to spy on the Titans, but he was executed due to genuinely falling in love with her (though Starfire never found out the truth about him).
</li><li> She would be widowed twice, and both times with Tamaranean men: the first one was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with Prince Karras forced by her sister Blackfire to secure a political alliance, which caused no small amount of angst due to both Kory and Karras being in love with their own someone else. Even though they were married, Starfire returned to Earth to be with the Titans with Karras' approval and he would later die fighting his sister-turned-evil. Later on, she married General Phy'zzon and their union worked out a little better in no small part to her relationship with Dick being severely shaken, but he would sacrifice his life to save countless others.
</li><li> Though Dick Grayson remains alive of all her love interests, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarcrossedLovers">the ever cruel fate works to keep them apart</a> since they were engaged and nearly married once before the ceremony was interrupted by Trigon possessing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Raven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Raven">Raven</a>.

And if you don't die in that issue, then you'll die in the next issue you show up. Somewhat funnily, one of the two women who escaped this fate is the only one Hex married (she left him; the other was as hardened and skilled a gunfighter and bounty hunter as Hex and could take care of herself).

This reasoning comes to a head when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sam is left tearfully telling the seemingly-dead Daniel that she loves him after he's apparently sacrificed himself to save the world, privately vowing as she cries in his office that Daniel will be the last man she lets herself have feelings for, only to do a complete 180 when Jack reveals that Daniel isnt dead</span>.

His actual girlfriend Digger is murdered by the peacekeepers shortly after he gets home. Three years later (when he's almost nineteen) he has a couple of dates with the local tailor's seventeen year-old daughter but she breaks up with him for his drinking and then is reaped into the games anyway as a way of tormenting him.

You can be his friend, his surrogate daughter, or his friendly antagonist. You can even fall in love with one of his friends. But if you fall in love with The Duke himself, your chances of death are upped considerably. Your chances only improve if 1.) You and the Duke are an estranged couple, looking for reconciliation, 2.) You're played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaureenOHara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaureenOHara">Maureen O'Hara</a>, or 3.) You marry another character, thus giving the Duke something else to angst about. John Wayne appeared in so many movies that there are actually many aversions, including some of his best-known films like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stagecoach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stagecoach">Stagecoach</a></em>, <em>Angel and the Badman</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RioBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RioBravo">Rio Bravo</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElDorado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElDorado">El Dorado</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hatari">Hatari!</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShootist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShootist">The Shootist</a></em>.

Why else would anyone marry James Bond if not for the experience of the honeymoon? Even Dominique Paradis, the first girl in video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nightfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nightfire">NightFire</a></em> gets kicked off a roof for her trouble. Generally speaking, it's best to be the second woman Bond hooks up with during the course of a mission, or possibly the bit character he has a fling with before the mission even starts and is only present in that one scene. More often than not, the first woman he sleeps with is killed while the second survives. As an overall statistic, as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spectre">Spectre</a></em>, sleeping with Bond brings with it a 30.51% (18 out of 59) of dying before the end of the movie. Of course, the death rate varies from Bond to Bond:
<ul><li> Connery: 25% (4 out of 16)
</li><li> Lazemby: 33.33% (1 out of 3)
</li><li> Moore: 26.32% (5 out of 19)
</li><li> Dalton: <em>0%</em> (0 out of 4, but Felix gets married in <em>Licence To Kill</em> and guess what what happens to her)
</li><li> Brosnan: 30% (3 out of 10)
</li><li> Craig (as of <em>Spectre</em>): 42.86% (3 out of 7, and the first survivor wasn't until his third film. Ladies, don't kiss him unless your will is in order).
</li><li> It was implied Leiter's wife was an ex of Bond and there were still feelings. Which means even Dalton's survival rate is &lt; 100%, if you count pre-movie nookie.

Sometimes within 30 seconds (depending on what you consider dead). Lampshaded by Jack in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd">third movie</a>, who refuses a kiss. Once is quite enough, indeed.

It's not that he's jealous, he's gay and shares his bed with young men. He just wants to torment her, and/or prevent her lovers from gaining any political influence. It is implied that he orders the young men to start an affair with her in the first place. The Queen herself is a kind woman, and mourns the fates of her lovers, but is unable to do anything about it, as if she complained, she would be the next person found dead.

<ul><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em>, we have Jack Bauer. Let's go down the list: Teri died, Nina was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, Kate dumped him, Claudia died, Audrey was made to believe <em>Jack</em> had died, Diane broke up with him when he got back together with Audrey, who was then tortured to insanity, and Renee got sniped off less than an hour after sleeping with Jack. Geez, this guy can't catch a break.
<ul><li> It extends beyond just Jack. Tony had also been in a relationship with Nina, then had Michelle divorce him, then get murdered shortly after they remarried <em>and she became pregnant with their son</em>. Every president that is shown with an on-screen spouse ends up divorced after one season David Palmer after Season 1, Charles Logan after Season 5 (though he first appeared late in season 4), and Allison Taylor after season 7, and David Palmer had a later girlfriend break up with him due to an inability to handle the limelight of being involved with the president. Audrey Raines was on the verge of reconciling with her husband when he died from injuries sustained when he took a bullet for Jack, <em>the man she'd been involved with during her separation from him</em>, then is led to believe Jack is dead, then finds out he's alive just before he gets taken prisoner by the Chinese and never really learns otherwise due to the aforementioned torture she gets after going to China to look for him. Even Kim had this for a while, as her first boyfriend was incarcerated, her second broke up with her after losing a leg as the result of her actions, and her third broke up with her after she was led to believe that her father died and may or <a class="urllink" href="http://24.wikia.com/wiki/Chase_Edmunds#Background_information_and_notes">may not have died offscreen a few seasons after his final appearance.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> She at least finally gets a happy ending, getting married and having a daughter at some point between seasons 6 and 7.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Audrey, after finding Jack was alive, gets taken out in the last episode of the mini-series. </span>
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much the entire cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/The100">The 100</a></em> suffers from this. Not including casual hookups and crushes that don't go anywhere, by the end of Season 3 there have been 11 romantic relationships involving Regular characters, and 7 of them have ended with one of the characters involved in the relationship dying. Of the remaining 4, 1 ended with an offscreen breakup due to the actor for one of the characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">getting fired between seasons</a>, and 3 are still ongoing as of the Season 3 finale. Of note is that all 3 of those ongoing relationships started sometime during Season 3. Clarke, however, has it especially bad. She has had 3 love interests: Wells (who loved her so much he was willing to get sent down to Earth with her, although she saw them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFriends">Just Friends</a>), Finn (whom she had a relationship with when they first landed on the ground), and Lexa (whom she grows closer to in season 3 and finally has sex with in "Thirteen"), and all of them ended up dying.
</li><li> This happens a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Skye/Daisy: First love interest compromised a classified data feed to a HYDRA subsidiary, and got dumped and abandoned thousands of miles from his actual home. Second love interest turned out to be a HYDRA mole, who caused problems for the team for a good season and a half after being exposed before he was killed. And then his corpse was taken over by an ancient Inhuman boogieman, who would continue causing problems for another half a season. Third love interest made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to kill said boogieman, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt">Survivor's Guilt</a> of which still haunts her two seasons later.
</li><li> May: Had Skye's love interest #2 as a casual lover until he was exposed as a traitor. Second love interest was her ex-husband, who she was trying to reconcile with when he got turned into an extremely violent Inhuman, who was killed by one of the henchmen of the previously mentioned Inhuman boogieman. Love interest #3 ends up with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourDaysAreNumbered">incurable condition</a> right after they decide to give romance a try.
</li><li> Coulson: Had to leave first love interest after his death (and offscreen resurrection) in the movies. Second love interest was sniped by Skye's love interest #2. And then the treatment that brought him back to life starts breaking down.
</li><li> Simmons: First love interest was killed by the Inhuman boogieman (Most of these love interest deaths trace back to Ward and/or Hive. Maybe now that they're both dead the team will have better luck?). The second is Fitz (After nearly three entire seasons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>), which appears stable... for now.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, both Oliver and Laurel suffer from this:

Felicity and Oliver get a relationship upgrade only to have the restaurant they're in be blown up by an RPG. Felicity survives but the relationship ends soon after.
</li><li> Laurel: Oliver gets stranded on an island for five years and Tommy is killed saving her life. In season two she starts dating Sebastian Blood who turns out to be the villain Brother Blood. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Ravager kills him in the season finale.</span>

Steed's partner was a young woman who recounted the tragic deaths of her many husbands, apparently by bad luck, as Steed grew more disconcerted each time she revealed a new former spouse.
</li><li> Susan Ivanova of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>. First lover to appear on the screen survives but turns out to be an evil neo-Nazi terrorist. Second gets her personality permanently overwritten with an evil implanted artificial personality just after they slept together for the first time, and may possibly die offscreen afterwards. Third dies in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> by using an alien medical device to give her all his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a> when she's mortally wounded. And if Claudia Christian hadn't left the show, she'd then have moved on to a cult leader who killed himself with all his followers.

"Black Market" mentioned something about a pregnant girlfriend who died in the Cylon attack, but we're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">not certain</a> that episode is canon.
</li><li> Chief Tyrol doesn't fare any better.
<ul><li> First love interest: Tory Foster. They forget all about being in love and planning to get married after Cavil kills them and resurrects them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories">Fake Memories</a>. She kills Cally and he kills her for it.
</li><li> Second love interest: Boomer. She turns out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">sleeper agent</a> and is killed by Cally (but resurrects). He verbally hates on her. They are on opposite sides on New Caprica, but don't see much of each other. When they next meet, she manipulates him into setting her free so that she can <em>intentionally</em> betray the whole ship. He verbally hates on her, again, and never sees her again. Though she redeems herself, she is killed right after. Oh, and he's kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestIsRelative">her dad</a>, anyway.
</li><li> Third love interest: Cally. She shot Boomer. She was sleeping with Hotdog before she got together with the Chief, and does not tell Chief that Nicky isn't his biological son. They argue a lot, but are genuinely in love. After finding that he is a Cylon, she attacks him and tries to commit murder-suicide with Nicky. Tory talks her out of it to get Nicky and then kills her. He verbally hates on her, and <em>beats her</em> when she picks the wrong time to wake him up.
</li></ul></li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, averting this trope is part of the reason for the creation of Laura Roslin's character in nBSG. Ronald D. Moore wanted a female co-lead to counterbalance Adama, so that way the show wouldn't spend time trying to pair Adama with various women of the week.
</li></ul></li><li> Avon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em> suffered from this one; Paul Darrow, the actor playing him, says he became known as the "kiss of death". In fact one actress was truly furious to learn that he was going to kiss her, because she had been hoping to stay on for another episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza">Bonanza</a></em> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a>. Ben Cartwright, the patriarch of the Cartwright family, has three sons from three different women. One of his wives died in childbirth, another died after falling from a horse, while the other one was killed in an Indian attack. Each Cartwright man has a string of girlfriends over 14 seasons, many of whom do not survive the experience. The worst man to flirt with, statistically, was the youngest, Little Joe Cartwright: over 14 seasons, he had 39 girlfriends, 25.6% of whom died. His girlfriend mortality rate became so legendary that other TV shows started to lampshade it. (For example, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em>, Mrs. Cunningham refuses to watch any episode where Little Joe gets engaged, simply because "that girl is headed straight for Boot Hill!")

(To be fair, only Renee died <em>while</em> they were lovers; Anya survived a year after the split, and Cordelia about five years.) Hopefully Dawn will have better luck.
</li><li> Poor Buffy's luck isn't much better. Her first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> turned evil and had to be killed (and then was revived and left her...long story), her second was a jerk who dumped her as soon as they had sex, her third left because he couldn't handle being weaker than her, and her fourth and final one died in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> (but got better). In three seasons since then, she still hasn't dared to enter a serious relationship.
<ul><li> <em>Finally</em> averted in season 10 onward; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she gets back together with Spike (the above-mentioned 4th <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> who died then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">got better</a>)</span> and they actually manage a healthy and happy relationship for a few years.

<ul><li> "Girl in the Fireplace": Madame de Pompadour. Just found romance, offered her companionship, then he went through the fireplace only to find that he'd just missed her funeral. He should have paid more attention to the old fairy tales.
<ul><li> To be fair, Madame de Pompadour is a real historical figure and her death is probably a fixed point in time, so her death was inevitable. The fact that every time the Doctor visited, several years had passed, set him up for this disappointment even if he didn't realise it.

However, she died <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">saving his life</a> by pushing Max Capricorn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">the vortex of a Nuclear Storm Drive</a> several minutes later.
</li><li> "Forest of the Dead" puts a twist on it - thanks to time travel, he sees River die before their relationship has even started from his perspective. The pre-Library River then becomes a recurring character, meaning they both know a lot about the other's future that they can't divulge.
</li><li> "Death in Heaven": After Osgood shows a new preference for bowties and manages to quickly figure out something the Doctor himself missed, he (not in so many words) offers her a spot in the TARDIS. Unfortunately, he does this within the earshot of Missy / the Master. This might be one of the reasons she chooses to kill Osgood after breaking free.
</li><li> As a general rule of thumb, if the Doctor offers to let someone travel with them at any time before the very end of the episode, that person has an excellent chance of being dead before they have a chance to set foot in the TARDIS (see Lynda, Astrid, Jenny, Reinette, etc.). This rule doesn't apply if the same offer is made just before the credits roll. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Rory</a> later notes this, remarking to Amy, "Whenever the Doctor gets matey with someone, I get the urge to inform their next of kin."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DoctorWhoExpandedUniverse">Doctor Who Expanded Universe</a></em> novels, he also has a dead male love interest. And one he was just a big jerk to and ran off on after being a bitch to him all the time. Plus one dead female love interest and one who gave him a taste of his own medicine and was just impossible. He also acquires a companion, Fitz, who has at the very least three dead, evil, or vanished love interests to everyone the Doctor has (plus a few male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotLoveInterest">Not Love Interests</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">or are they?</a>— who meet bad ends, too), and who enforces this trope upon himself by preferring traveling with the Doctor to staying with anyone. Seriously, fuck either of them and you'd better hope they just lose interest before they jinx you to death.
</li><li> Ace also had this effect on people she became close to — such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E1RemembranceOfTheDaleks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS25E1RemembranceOfTheDaleks">Mike Smith</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E2GhostLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E2GhostLight">Gwendoline Pritchard</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E3TheCurseOfFenric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E3TheCurseOfFenric">Captain Sorin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E4Survival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS26E4Survival">Karra</a>. In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctorWhoNewAdventures">Doctor Who New Adventures</a></em> she carried on the trend.
<ul><li> The only person Ace has ever had a relationship with who didn't meet a bad end was Sabolom Glitz, and even then their relationship was retconned in later by the producer after it had to be cut from the one episode in which they both appear.

Her first love interest, Ronnie Raymond (Robbie Amell), is dead at the start of the show, comes back, and then sacrifices himself to save the world. Her second love interest, Jay Garrick, dies violently in front of her a while later - but it later turns out that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakingTheDead">faked his death</a> because he's actually the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">main villain</a>, Zoom (Hunter Zolomon).

<ul><li> In "Breaker of Chains", Margaery seems perturbed that her husbands have a habit of dying gruesomely, even though it's clear she didn't love them (well, the first two at least, the third is more ambiguous). Then again, considering the amount of political maneuvering and payoffs she and her family have to go through to get these marriages, she's probably frustrated at the extra amount of work she has to keep putting in. She is survived by her third and final husband for a few hours <em>at most</em>; then he commits suicide, not in small part because of his grief for her death.
</li><li> Daenerys' beloved husband Khal Drogo dies, and so does her intended Hizdahr zo Loraq before the political marriage takes place. There's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyguardCrush">Jorah Mormont</a> who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveisUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveisUnrequited">one-sided love for her</a> culminates with him dying in her arms after protecting her in battle against the White Walkers.

</li></ul></li><li> Rose from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldenGirls">The Golden Girls</a></em>. For a long time it was a painful and embarrassing secret for her that her husband, Charlie, died of a heart attack while they were making love. This kept her from getting intimate with another man for nearly two decades afterwards, until she finally is able to move on early in the series. Then, in a later episode, she brings a new boyfriend home and he also dies in bed with her (and turns out to have been married as well). At the end of the latter episode, when Rose must once again move on with a new man, she actually experiments with a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor">Gallows Humor</a> on this. She convinces Dorothy and Blanche that she went to bed with her new lover while they were away. And he died. And the sheriff didn't believe her about the curse, so she slept with him to prove it. And he died. Rose then bursts into laughter and admits she made that up.
</li><li> Alex Karev of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreysAnatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a></em> is not someone you want to date. He's had five serious relationships, two of which ended in marriage. The first girlfriend was an already-married amnesiac who wound up in the Psych ward. His first wife got cancer, had ghost sex with her dead crush, and got fired. He ditched his third relationship after she landed in Psych ward after a breakdown, then she died. His fourth left for Africa. His fifth girlfriend and second wife <em>also</em> developed mental issues and (voluntarily) wound up in Psych, though she got better and most of the issue was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> discovering that she was a child of rape and then treating a rape victim the next day</span>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Haven">Haven</a></em>, all of Duke's love interests end up dying, with the exception of Audrey.

The first after living long enough to give him three children (who were killed along with her) the second after they were married for probably a few weeks. Both murdered by angry gods. Iolaus had a wife in the first film-length episode, but she died (supposedly in childbirth) and was never mentioned again.
</li><li> Hiro Nakamura of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> has absolutely zero luck in the love department. His first love interest, Charlie, ends up killed by Sylar almost the moment they figure out they have something. He tries to use his time travel to save her, but ends up six months in the past instead, setting up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TieInNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TieInNovel">Tie-In Novel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SavingCharlie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SavingCharlie">Saving Charlie</a></em> (which reveals that most previous women in his life have simply opted to avoid interacting with him whenever they can). Hiro takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">The Slow Path</a> back to the present and forms a relationship with Charlie over those six months, but then has to allow her to be killed again because her death is what caused him to take that leap back in time in the first place. Hiro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondLove">Second Love</a>, Yaeko from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodMedievalJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodMedievalJapan">Hollywood Medieval Japan</a>, doesn't actively die on screen, but he can't be with her because that would break the timeline and he might end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyOwnGrandpa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyOwnGrandpa">his own ancestor</a> - oh, and there's the whole deal with his hero Kensei being <em>extremely</em> jealous (did we mention Kensei is immortal and takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">The Slow Path</a> back to the present to hunt down Hiro for daring to steal his destined girl?). Then, Hiro manages to figure out a way to convince Sylar to actually <em>save</em> Charlie from an aneurysm instead of killing her for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">Photographic Memory</a>, but Charlie gets ripped out of his life <em>again</em> by evil carnie Samuel and sent back to the 1940s using his own time traveler - but, without knowing where or when she ended up, Hiro couldn't save her. She ended up building her own life without him, only meeting him again briefly when she's dying of old age.
</li><li> Being 5000 years old, Methos on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> is the king of this trope. Aside from Cassandra, who was more a slave, he had 60 wives through the years. The other immortals fall into it too (see Film)
</li><li> Mark Gordon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighwayToHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HighwayToHeaven">Highway to Heaven</a></em> meets a woman, falls in love with her, and she dies of cancer, all in one episode.
</li><li> Common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InspectorMorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/InspectorMorse">Inspector Morse</a></em>, where Morse's love interests usually turn out to be either the next victim or the murderer. The spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lewis">Lewis</a></em> carries on the trend.
</li><li> Liv, the protagonist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IZombie">iZombie</a></em> has terrible luck in the romance department. First of all, as a zombie, she can only be with other zombies, or she risks spreading the virus. Secondly, of the five major love interests she dates during the series, three ends up dead, while the other two end with really bad breakups. In the final season, one surviving ex is killed after committing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. The curse finally breaks when Major, the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> throughout the series, seemingly dies... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">but then turns out to have survived</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins">The series ends with the two together</a>.
</li><li> All the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">False Romantic Leads</a> for Sarah "Mac" Mackenzie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em> died one way or another. The curse also affected Harmon "Harm" Rabb, Jr. too, but with the difference that only one of them died. And the one who died? Portrayed by the same actress who went on to play Mac in the rest of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderAgito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderAgito">Kamen Rider Agito</a></em>, any woman who doesn't want to get killed by an Unknown would better avoid Ryoo/Gills. The only one who survived was his FORMER girlfriend. Looks like she left him just in time!
</li><li> Michael Knight, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider">Knight Rider</a></em> fame, once got married... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowedAtTheWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowedAtTheWedding">for approximately 30 seconds. Then she died taking a bullet for him.</a> One wonders why <em>the sentient car</em> wasn't scanning the scene and reporting it and why they were stupid enough to hold a wedding in open place when the guy had a bounty on his head in the first place.
</li><li> Stan and Xev in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lexx">Lexx</a></em>. They are desperately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadyForLovemaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadyForLovemaking">Ready for Lovemaking</a> with anyone their spaceship encounters, whether human, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing">alien</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Robosexual">robot</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnythingThatMoves">Anything That Moves</a>. Even when they find willing partners, they almost never get laid before their prospective lovers die.
</li><li> Something of a reversal/subversion of this trope: the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeOnMars2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LifeOnMars2006">Life On Mars</a></em> ends with main character Sam Tyler returning to the world of the story - and his love interest - by jumping off a rooftop and committing suicide. The name of said love interest? Annie Cartwright.
</li><li> Sleeping with Sayid on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> is an excellent way to get dead. Dating someone to whom Sayid gives dating advice is an excellent way to get dead within one episode.
</li><li> Bo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LostGirl">Lost Girl</a></em> has this issue as she is a succubus who drains her partners' life force. Subverted later on when she learns to control her powers and finds a love interest with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist">The Mentalist</a></em>, Van Pelt has had two love interests apart from Rigsby (who she always liked, but wasn't allowed to date for most of the series). The first turned out to be the son of a man whose life Jane had ruined, and tried to kill her and Jane. The second, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">whom she was engaged to</a>, turned out to be one of Red John's friends, and tried to kill her and Lisbon. She had to shoot him herself. Thankfully, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> allowed her to get married to her partner Rigsby. They now have two kids (one of their own and one from Rigsby's previous relationship) and their own successful security firm. The story eventually had them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a>.
</li><li> In the old <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MikeHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MikeHammer">Mike Hammer</a></em> series any woman he showed an interest in invariably either died or turned out to be a villain. Lampshaded by the DA who once referred to him as "the angel of death".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MissionImpossible">Mission: Impossible</a></em> was inconsistent about this. In one episode Jim Phelps fell in love with a beautiful double agent who died protecting him from the bad guy. When the same thing happened to Paris in a later episode, he was able to rescue her at the end, though she was never seen again... although in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> episode "My Friend, My Enemy" it's shown that Paris fell in love with a magician's assistant who was <strong>killed by the jealous magician during his act</strong>. Dude can't catch a break.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MortalKombatConquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MortalKombatConquest">Mortal Kombat: Conquest</a></em> once killed off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporaryLoveInterest">Temporary Love Interests</a> for all three of the main characters within a two-episode span (much to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Phelous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Phelous">Phelous's</a> annoyance).
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMusketeers">The Musketeers</a></em>, Aramis falls into this trope. Adele, the Cardinal's mistress, ends up being shot to death on the cardinal's orders in the pilot episode (although Aramis doesn't find this out until the next season). His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove">First Love</a>, Isabel, who he was almost forced to marry in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunWedding">Shotgun Wedding</a>, ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheVeil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheVeil">Taking the Veil</a>. He runs into her again in season 1 only for her to die shortly after. In the season 2 premiere he worries that this fate will befall the Queen.
</li><li> Special Agent Leroy Jethro Gibbs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>. His first wife was murdered, and the next three were divorced. Any woman he is seen to be in a relationship with is usually in one shot, and is gone by the end of the episode.
<ul><li> Sadly, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ex-wife #2, Diane, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">murdered</a></span> as well.
</li><li> Even ex-girlfriends aren't safe. Case in point: Jenny Shepard, possibly Lara Macy (their interactions in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot">Poorly Disguised Pilot</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCISLosAngeles">NCIS: Los Angeles</a></em> heavily imply a prior relationship or romantic feelings at the very least), and Ellen Wallace, who broke off their engagement <em>the day before</em> being killed in the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon.
</li><li> Even <em>non</em> girlfriends aren't safe—he was arguably very attracted to Kate, and flashbacks to his boot camp days show that he had a crush on a female recruit. Even though it never went beyond flirtation, he clearly felt enough to be devastated when she herself was killed and still remember her years later.
</li><li> Samantha Ryan and Hollis Mann seem to be doing all right so far, though Gibbs specifically keeps avoiding an Unretired Hollis after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Diane dies</span> out of fear of this trope.
</li><li> Actually fits Ziva of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> just as well or better - Langer, who she's implied to be in a relationship with, is shot by her coworker Lee, the man she falls in love with dies of radiation poisoning, and her serious boyfriend Michael is shot by her coworker and love interest Tony. So far, her relationships are lucky to last out an episode. Her longest lasting boyfriend, Ray, went on and off for a couple seasons before he proposed to her. Then she arrested him for murder. Her final relationship was a one-night stand with Tony, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which resulted in a child, which DiNozzo didn't learn about until her house was blown up with her in it, leaving Tony to raise their one-year-old daughter alone. It later turned out that she survived, but had to go into hiding. Now that everyone behind the attempt on her life is dead or imprisoned, she's free to reunite with Tony and Tali</span>.
</li><li> Speaking of Tony, this trope applies to him as well, with a significant amount of women who he's been attracted to or involved with meeting an untimely death—Kate, Paula, a victim in the episode "Obsession", and Ziva herself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though it turns out, she's alive, and is implied to be coming back to him now that her final mission is over</span>.
</li><li> Agent McGee is also an excellent fit, as (with the exception of Abby) anyone he's even shown an interest in either dies or turns out to be the murderer-of-the-week. The cute computer programmer he flirts with for half an episode is strangled right in front of him. A Petty Officer he had a thing for in training turns out to be a lesbian AND is the episode's killer to boot. A cute girl he picks up in a coffee shop ends up being a foreign national who holds him at gunpoint for information and is shot seconds later. His most recent girlfriend Delilah was caught in a terrorist bombing, lost the ability to walk, and then took a transfer to Dubai. She eventually moved back and married him at the end of season 14, and they're expecting a child, so he has hopes of escaping.
</li><li> And then there's Ellie Bishop, who has seen her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">happy marriage</a> go kaput thanks to her husband's infidelity and her new boyfriend/would-have-been fiance shot and killed.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in the first few seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthernExposure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NorthernExposure">Northern Exposure</a></em>: everyone who ever got lucky with Maggie had eventually died in some freakish way (ate tainted potato salad, took a wrong turn into a missile range, fell asleep on a glacier and froze, was hit by a falling satellite shortly after learning he didn't have cancer). Main character Joel later escapes the curse, but whenever they get frisky a gun spontaneously goes off nearby.

Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicBackstory">Tragic Backstory</a> is that her mother Cora murdered Regina's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLove">True Love</a>, a simple farmhand, because Regina planned to run off with the boy, ruining Cora's plan to marry her off to a king; this prompted Regina's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">descent into villainy</a>.

Regina does pretty well as a loner after that, but in the final season (of which she is a main protagonist) she resumes a prior casual relationship with Dr. Facilier; there seems to be the potential for more, but then he is unceremoniously murdered and stashed in a closet. She doesn't even really get any time to deal with that, since the show is racing towards the series finale by then.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive">One Life to Live</a></em>'s Bo Buchannan had so many of his love interests killed off that when it was obvious that he was going to be paired with new character Nora—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">given that they couldn't stand each other</a>—fans actually pleaded for them NOT to be paired, despite their excellent chemistry, because Nora had rapidly become a favorite and fans did not want her to meet the fate of Bo's other lovers. Luckily, the writers decided it was time Bo had some luck in the romance department and Nora was allowed to live.
</li><li> Played with by Cadet Annie Metford in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceAcademyTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceAcademyTheSeries">Police Academy: The Series</a></em>, whose newlywed husband died in their bed while they were making love. All subsequent attempts of anyone getting close to her result in serious bodily harm. Fortunately for the guys, it seems that a direct sexual relationship and/or marriage seems the only way to trigger this trope to its fullest extent.
</li><li> Used three times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>:
<ul><li> First with Kryten's fellow droid love interest Camille, who turned out to be a GELF that changes appearance depending on the viewer's true love (causing the rest of the crew to also fall for her), and her true form was an enormous green blob. She had to leave due to her husband Victor finally being reunited with her. Kryten lampshades the plot of the episode: "It's the old, old story. Droid meets droid, droid becomes chameleon, droid loses chameleon, chameleon becomes blob, droid gets blob back again, blob meets blob, blob runs away with blob and droid loses blob, chameleon and droid! How many times have we heard that story?"
</li><li> This was used a second time with Rimmer's love interest Nirvana Crane, who gives up her position onboard the Holoship Enlightenment (and thus losing her life in the process) so that Rimmer can fulfill his dream of having a place on the ship. When Rimmer hears of this, he immediately resigns and returns to Red Dwarf, in order that she can continue living, despite the fact that the two will never see each other again. Rimmer says "We won't be apart, we just... won't be together. [<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>] I cannot believe I just said that!"
<ul><li> Notice the obvious solution: Switch 'em. Rimmer would get his dream job and Nirvana would get to... join... the... crew. Erm. Okay, Rimmer must definitely love her to be willing to spare her that fate, and the writers must have figured that we'd think that was an option, because the remaining crew of Red Dwarf spent their portion of the episode interviewing other dead crewmates to take his slot, and each declined. As one pointed out:
<div class="indent"><strong>Candidate:</strong> No, I think I'm better off where I am, actually.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Cat (?):</strong> But you're dead!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Candidate:</strong> And meeting you three has helped me appreciate that a whole lot more.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Series X, in keeping with Rimmer's luck, introduces his perfect match - one of the greatest erroneous reasoners in the known Universe - and promptly chucks her out of an airlock.

<dl><dd><div class="indent"> "I feel compelled to warn you, most of the guys I've dated recently have died."

</li><li> Now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">consider</a> that Daniel has come back from the dead multiple times, and Carter got snaked in season two.
</li><li> Carter goes above and beyond the call of duty for this trope, as the men interested in her rarely die alone. Jonas (not Jonas Quinn), who lead one of the teams, murdered a teammate, set himself up as a god, then died with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> when SG-1 incited a rebellion. Lantash, a Tok'Ra, took two hosts with him, the first when Carter had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a>, the second and Lantash himself in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>. And Martouf, Lantash's first host who had been involved with the Tok'Ra who snaked Carter and transferred some of that affection to Carter, turned out to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a> and was killed trying to assassinate the president in the abovementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Shoot the Dog</a> incident. Ambassador Joe Faxon let himself get captured to allow her to escape the Aschen, but then probably died with them if they dialed the black hole address.

</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> versions of Carter are not immune: two that married O'Neill had him get killed defending their version of the SGC from Apophis' invasion.

See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Girl of the Week</a>.
<ul><li> This was lampshaded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, where Kirk slept with Uhura's roommate, implying this sort of thing happened a lot.

Naturally, both women wind up being killed by recurring villains before long.
<ul><li> Maybe the reason Troi broke up with him offscreen and got back with Riker was because she was smart?

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> in "Sex and Violence," when the boys are tracking a shape-shifting siren who manifests as the victim's perfect mate and fantasy. When Sam sleeps with a hot doctor, the audience assumes she will turn out to be the siren and will be killed by the boys. It's not Sam's pretty doctor. The real siren is targeting Dean, and it manifests as a <em>man</em>.
<ul><li> There may be an element of attempting to protect her from this effect in Sam's 'eh, why bother to say goodbye' reaction before they leave town. But mostly he <em>honestly doesn't care much about her</em>, which is a trauma-induced departure from his previous characterization; Dean hooks up, Sam dates. Only he doesn't, much, because it's not terribly compatible with their lifestyle and he's usually in mourning for someone. And when he does? Dean has actually killed two of Sam's more romantic partners himself. (Sorry, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JewelStaite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JewelStaite">Kaylee</a> - turns out the Winchesters CAN take the sky from you.)
</li></ul></li><li> He seemed to have gotten away from it for a little while. But then made up for it with four women in one episode.
</li><li> In the season seven episode "Time For A Wedding" Dean called the trope when trying to talk sense into a love-potioned Sam with the line: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">"Have you forgotten the average lifespan of your hookups?"</a>
</li><li> Sam was already aware of this in season one, but Sarah Blake managed to avoid it...until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead">it came back to bite her</a> <em>seven seasons later</em>, all because Crowley felt like making a point. Ladies, avoid Sam Winchester at all costs.
</li><li> In the episode, "Rock and a Hard Place", The Brothers Winchester become born again virgins as part of an investigation. When asked why he wanted to be a virgin again, Sam replied:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sam:</strong> Well, I guess because every woman I've...ever... had relations with, uh...it...hasn't ended well.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Dean:</strong> He ain't lying.
</div></li><li> There are even two fan-names for the phenomenon. The "Peen of Death", or the "Dick of Doom". (It is generally accepted, however, that if you have to die in that crapsack universe, it's definitely not a bad way to go out. If that sounds dubious, go back and watch the season 2 episode "Heart" again.)
</li><li> Dean doesn't fare much better. Most of his casual hookups make it out okay, but if he actually falls in love with you emotionally, watch yourself! Just ask Anna or Jo. Lisa had a huge chunk of her memory wiped, which is probably the only reason she's still breathing, effectively rendering her "dead" to Dean. And depending on your interpretation, note that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Castiel has kicked the bucket a few times himself by now.</a>
</li><li> Castiel's now the deadliest to sleep with, simply because he's had sex once, and... she died. So he's running at 100%.
</li><li> Misha Collins has said at a convention that (paraphrased) Charlie most likely will not die - because she's a lesbian, and is therefore not a sexual risk or attainable partner for the boys. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She died anyway.</span>
</li><li> It's not just sexual partners either-anyone who befriends or helps one or both of the Winchester brothers (including Sam and Dean themselves, numerous times) tends to get killed off.

First wife Zandra is killed in the explosion at Eagle Mountain (end of season 1), second wife Tai-San is kidnapped by an invading tribe and assassinated (off-screen) when her attempt to infiltrate them is revealed (season 5), and third wife Siva is shot dead by her own sister (end of season 5).

His second love Jenna is turned into a vampire against her will and is dead by the end of season 2 as well. His second wife, Jo, is brutally murdered by her insane twin brother at their wedding.

</li><li> <em>Eternal Loser</em> by Leslie Fish is about a space hero whose love interest dies at the end of each "episode." By the end of the song, he's afraid his ship will leave him too.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em> (well, the Book of Tobit, which is in some Bibles) a woman named Sarah has a bad case of this—she is married seven times, but each groom dies before the marriage can be consummated. It turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">a demon named Asmodeus is in lust with her</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">and killing all his competition</a>; the hero (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">her cousin</a>, Tobias), marries her and is able to drive the demon away following instructions from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm">disguised</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelRaphael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelRaphael">Archangel Raphael</a>. He survives the wedding night, to the immense surprise of his new father-in-law, who had spent the night digging his grave; meanwhile, Raphael seals Asmodeus away, and the couple lives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a>.
<ul><li> In another example, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfGenesis">Book of Genesis</a></em>, a woman named Tamar is married to Er, but he dies without leaving any heirs, so she is married off to his younger brother Onan: common practice among many ancient Middle Eastern peoples—including, historically, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">the Hebrews<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>—known as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levirate_marriage">levirate marriage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The first child of a levirate marriage is considered to be the child and heir of the deceased first brother. Onan doesn't want to father children on someone else's behalf, so he uses coitus interruptus, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantGetAwayWithNuthin">his death is attributed to</a>. Their father Judah, has one young son named Shelah left, and fears for Shelah's life since he believes Tamar to be cursed; Judah tells her that he'll give Shelah to her when the boy grows up... but when Shelah grows up, he is <em>not</em> married off to Tamar as promised, so she impersonates a shrine prostitute and sleeps with Judah so she can get pregnant and continue the bloodline, with the precaution of taking some of Judah's belonging as "payment" — which she shows to Judah before explaining herself. Judah realises <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">Tamar is in the right</a> and accepts responsibility, with Tamar's twin kids being acknowledged as part of the family.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels">The Four Gospels</a>, this is implied to be the case with the Samaritan woman Jesus encounters at the well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialSpouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialSpouse">She's been married five times</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">but it is unknown whether she was widowed several times or divorced several times</a>. (It's likely, however, that at least some of these marriages ended in the husband's death.) And she's living with a boyfriend, who is generally interpreted to already have a wife, making her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress">The Mistress</a>. Because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">social stigma she might have endured because of this trope</a>, she goes to the well by herself at high noon, rather than at dawn or at dusk like most women of her village would.

<ul><li> The series contains a very unique and interesting example since the curse is actually an unintentional (or intentional) result of certain decisions the player makes. It's only played straight if you leave your love interest to die on Virmire in the first game and if your choices get your second love interest killed during the suicide mission in the second. Then, in the third game, if you go into the final attack on earth with a low war asset value and bring your love interest in the squad for the final level, they get fried by Harbinger's beam. It is therefore possible to make Shepard fall in love with, and lose, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">a different person in each of the three games</a>.
</li><li> If your Femshep romanced Kaidan and chose to leave him to die on Virmire, and then moved on to Thane in the second game, you are <em>guaranteed</em> to lose two lovers, since there is genuinely no way to have Thane make it out of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>. To be fair, one of the first things he tells Shepard is that he's dying of an incurable respiratory condition, meaning that Shepard really only has herself to blame in that case.
</li><li> It's possible for the player to inflict this on Steve Cortez (whose husband died in the Collector attacks) or Jack (who's had past lovers die or backstab her on a grimly regular basis) if they pick an ending where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies">The Hero Dies</a>.

<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ActingLessons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ActingLessons">Acting Lessons</a>, Episode 6 will always end with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">either Megan or Melissa dying while your house is set ablaze.</span> Played with in the sense that you have to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">save Megan</span> if you rejected Melissa before this point, meaning that the one who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">died</span> isn't one of your love interests, but rather a very close friend. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played completely straight</a> if the player does not reject Melissa and dates both her and Megan, as they will then have the option to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">save one or the other, resulting in one of your love interests dying and the other being launched into crippling depression</span>.
<ul><li> Another example is with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leah,</span> who can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">die</span> if you make choices that result in Peter's gun being present in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leah's room when you and your girlfriend get kidnapped</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> It's a good rule of thumb for a lot, if not <em>all</em>, of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeyVisualArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeyVisualArts">Key/Visual Arts</a> stories that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadCone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoadCone">canonical</a> girl who hooks up with the protagonist dies in some way, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Clannad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Clannad">Nagisa</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Air" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Air">Misuzu</a> being prime examples.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters">Little Busters!</a></em> is an interesting case: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">technically it goes even further than the other examples, as <em>almost all</em> of the other characters in the story turn out to have been something close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a>... <em>except</em> the main girl. So in some ways, this is an inversion</span>!

</li><li> As if Larry Butz from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> wasn't a big enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> as is, he tends to lose his dates because they either leave him or end up dead, as seen in the first trial of the series.

<ul><li> Taiyang Xiao Long from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> had serious relationships with two of his former teammates. The first one, Raven Branwen, left soon after the birth of their daughter Yang. The second one, Summer Rose, disappeared while on a mission and is believed to have died. Yang mentions how losing two loves caused him to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">shut down</a>", leaving her to have to take care of her half-sister Ruby (though he eventually recovered).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Web Comics </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Elf from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary">Schlock Mercenary</a></em>. She even managed to kill off Captain Tagon in an alternate timeline. At one point, several other troops point this out when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt">Mauve Shirt</a> demolitions expert tries hitting on her. Guess what happens to <em>him</em>...
<ul><li> To discredit this, she gives a kiss to each of the other men on her squad and then tells them that now they are doomed they can bloody well start marching. Apparently, that didn't count since they survived. (Except for one who died much, much later.)
</li><li> Almost immediately after Kevyn dated her, he got killed, and only his blood nanites managed to bring him back from the dead.
</li><li> Considering that he keeps a running count of the number of times he's cheated death, this is similar to the Stargate example above, except canon.
</li><li> To wit, Elf is now five for six for killing men she's kissed. As has been mentioned, Tagon was an alternate reality, and Kevyn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">got better,</a> but the only survivor of Elf's kissing (Nick) had a good chunk of a story-arc dedicated to "breaking the curse."
</li></ul></li><li> Torg from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em> has a pretty bad track record when it comes to girlfriends. One was an evil vampire who he had to kill. Another is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">psychotic</a> and assassin who keeps dying and coming back. Another was driven insane after being traumatized by satanic kittens. And a fourth was killed by a demon lord trying to catch him. With all this Torg's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanNotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanNotSpitItOut">inability to tell Zoe he loves her</a> is perfectly justified.
<ul><li> Eventually Zoe came to the realization that not only was Torg in love with her, but she also loved him back! Which directly resulted in Oasis using pyrokinetic powers and almost killing her. She spent some time on life support. She was completely restored, except for the memory of the day in which she realized that she and Torg were in love and ended up getting incinerated by Oasis.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CharbyTheVampirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CharbyTheVampirate">Charby the Vampirate</a></em> all of Menulis' early dating attempts end with the death of his date during their first date. Luckily his eventual girlfriend is functionally immortal, especially considering she's not immune to this luck and ends up decapitated on their first date.

</li><li> Sollux Captor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> can be said to suffer from this, as both Aradia and Feferi have died at least once during the story. Feferi has, so far, stayed dead, but Aradia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">got better</a> eventually—but not before dying <em>twice.</em>
<ul><li> Really, the poor guy can't catch a break in this regard. Aradia's first death involved Vriska <em>mind-controlling Sollux into murdering her,</em> and her second death involved her robot body exploding right after she gave Sollux a (seemingly) final goodbye hug—though, as mentioned above, she recovered. Feferi, meanwhile, died at Eridan's hands, having rushed to avenge Sollux after Eridan blinded him.

And Aang is killed or nearly so in the season two finale, but then got brought back to life with magic water and Katara's healing powers... only to eventually die of natural causes as a middle-aged man, leaving Katara to outlive him by decades, as shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>. Sokka's love interest, Yue?

His <em>other</em> love interest, Suki? Ended up tortured in a Fire Nation prison, with the audience and the main characters not even sure if she was alive. But as revealed in the Season 3 episode, "The Boiling Rock," she was! Hooray!
<ul><li> It even traces back to their parents and grandparents! We never hear a word about Kanna's first husband, and Hakoda's wife Kya... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">well</a>...

The character known as Jack Flowers had this problem with his relationships: The first woman had her head sliced off by a sword, the second woman was flung off a building only to <em>explode</em> by a bomb strapped to her before hitting the ground, and the last woman was <em>tied to a rocket</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>—<em>very</em> darkly— on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>, where anyone or anything Toki Wartooth loves will die before the end of the episode. Fans, music teachers, pets, even children can die this way. Only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Doctor Rockso the cocaine snorting rock and roll clown</a> has survived so far due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Joker Immunity</a>. Even his family is not immune; he has despised his parents his whole life for their cold, religious zealot way of raising him and his father subsequently died the instant Toki forgave him.

Finally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he falls in love with a female assassin named Ashi in the final season. Then, we find out she's Aku's <em>daughter</em>, and he forces her to betray Jack. She does regain control and Jack finally makes it back with her to the past to destroy Aku. The real kicker? Because Jack killed Aku in the past, Ashi cannot exist and tragically disappears</span>.
</li><li> Ned Flanders from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> is a widower twice over: his first wife, Maude, was accidentally killed due to Homer's stupidity, and his second wife, Edna Krabappel, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffscreen">Killed Offscreen</a> after her voice actress Marcia Wallace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHer">passed away.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> takes this to ridiculous, parodying lengths in "Paris and Nicole's Prison Break".

Not five seconds after the two have sex with a guard, he falls over as his flesh burns off of his skeleton... and then Nicole realizes she forgot to give him the poison. Turns out that just happens to people Paris sleeps with.

Jack seems to be immune, at least, possibly because he's not a Cybertronian, possibly because he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">a major character</a>, possibly because <em>Prime</em> is not really a series that can get away with killing off human recurring characters willy-nilly.
