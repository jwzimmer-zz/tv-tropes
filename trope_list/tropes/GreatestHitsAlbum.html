</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>A specific type of Compilation Album (also known as a "Best of" Album), containing successful, previously released songs by a particular music artist or band. It's generally a great way for a band to make a bunch of money without doing any actual new work. It is also a great way for a record label to get a new album from a band who is trying to escape the label ASAP.
</p><p>To increase the possible appeal of the album, especially to people who already <em>own</em> the bulk of the artist's work (and thus likely to both be the biggest fans and already own all the hits), it is common to include remixes, alternate takes, live versions of popular songs, stand-alone singles that had not appeared on an album before (or, in the case of movie theme songs, only on a soundtrack album), and/or even a completely new song or two (which will, inevitably, be released as a single in order to promote the collection, and may or may not become a hit in its own right). Of course, all this is likely to piss off the completists, who might find themselves being forced to pay full album price for a single song (though the rise of digital music distribution has mollified this problem to a certain extent). Greatest Hits Albums are good purchases for casual fans of artists that they otherwise have no urge to buy complete albums of.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The very concept of the Greatest Hits Album is a double-edged sword, however; while such an album is likely to contain the most <em>commercially</em> successful of the artist's songs, it's pretty much a given that there will be at least a few critic- and/or fan-favorite B-sides and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumFiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlbumFiller">Album Filler</a> tracks that won't appear on the disc (and thus greater resentment against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSheepHit">Black Sheep Hit</a> that <em>will</em> inevitably be included). In hoping to appeal to the greatest number of fans, the album will end up completely pleasing no one. And at the other end of the spectrum, most bands and artists suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondAlbumSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondAlbumSyndrome">Second Album Syndrome</a> don't have <em>enough</em> hits in the can to truly justify an entire album thereof, and it may seem like they're scraping the bottom of the barrel as to what may qualify as a "hit".
</p><p>Artists are of mixed feelings about these albums as well. Many artists resist releasing one for fear that once they do, their regular albums will begin to be ignored. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> refused to release compilation albums for many years for this very reason.) Yet they are viewed as a necessary evil, as these provide an easy starting point for new fans who are curious about a particular artist's work but can't afford to buy the artist's entire recorded output (which, in some cases, can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchivePanic">extensive</a>). Popular music was mainly single-oriented until after the mid-1960s, and non-album singles were still common in Britain for longer than they were in the U.S. through the 1980s, with many of these singles only getting a stateside release on compilations. Musicians and bands don't always get to decide when to release a Greatest Hits Album. If an artist is leaving the label and does not own his own back catalog, and if he is successful at all, the label <em>will</em> release a Greatest Hits Album — sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">explicitly against the artist's wishes</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Sometimes the "Best of" title is used instead. This often reflects a less concentrated focus on chart hits - sometimes for legitimate reasons (e.g., album-oriented artists, influential artists with less commercial success or simply those whose career may not be best reflected solely by singles). Or it could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolishTheTurd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolishTheTurd">a poor excuse to cover up a lack of genuine hits</a>. Sometimes neither title is used (e.g., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DireStraits">Dire Straits</a>' compilation, "Money for Nothing"). To add perceived weight a more scholarly phrase such as "Anthology" is often used. This can be justified where the artist has had a long career but is equally often just a pretentious affectation.
</p><p>If the artist's output has been released on more than one record label, any "Best Of..." LP will invariably <em>only</em> contain the best of whatever the artiste has recorded <em>on that particular label</em>. Therefore any truly definitive "Best Of..." LP is unlikely to appear, for copyright and royalties reasons.
</p><p>As suggested by The Brunching Shuttlecocks, an easy way to determine the actual necessity of a Greatest Hits Album is to divide the number of songs on the album that actually charted, by the number of songs included on the album. Artists like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a> will bat nearly 1.000, whereas groups who have released Greatest Hits albums unneccesarily (i.e., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">One Hit Wonders</a>) will score far lower (e.g,: Kajagoogoo has hit ratio on its greatest hits album of 0.059, Timbuk 3 has 0.071, <em>The Best of Tiffany</em> scores 0.083, <em>The Best of Martika</em> 0.067 and so on.) The most egregious example may be <em>The Best of Shaquille O'Neal</em>, which has 12 songs, none of which could legitimately be considered a hit, for a ratio of zero.
</p><p>Despite the rise of digital music distribution largely making compilation albums obsolete, the trend has gotten worse over time. It used to be a general rule that an artist would have around four albums and/or ten years worth of material before they would release a compilation but this is no longer the case. Now best of albums can be released after two or even a <em>single</em> album. There is also a trend towards releasing multiple best of albums, often with only a single original album in between releases. Some artists or record companies will even release a repackaged best of album as the follow up to the previous best of album without any original material being released in the interim.
</p><p>The ordering of songs can be either random or chronological (though for double-disk compilations, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctDoubleAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctDoubleAlbum">it can get experimental</a>).
</p><p>A variation is a compilation of various artists by time period, genre, style or any combination of criteria. So you get albums with titles like <em>Best Rock Ballads Ever</em>, <em>Biggest Hits of 2004</em>, <em>Best of the Sixties</em> etc. Due to licensing issues, these can often omit iconic songs and/or artists. For example Sixties compilation albums don't include anything by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> (who was still popular in the 1960s despite his focus on film) for this reason making an album called <em>Best of the Sixties</em> a bit of letdown when it doesn't include anything by three of the decades biggest artists.

</li><li> Sony Music's <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Essential">The Essential<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> series, which usually uses 2 disks (some have had limited editions with three) to make the moniker worthy. There are those that still fall short, though (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a>'s had only two songs from each of their 13 albums; comprehensive, but still has many absences).
<ul><li> Universal had the <em>20th Century Masters: The Millennium Collection</em> series around the beginning of the 2000s, which were budget greatest hits albums of the artist's big hits packaged in with an essay-style biography by a music critic. Some of these are straight reissues of existing greatest hits albums such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Squeeze">Squeeze</a>'s <em>Singles - 45's and Under</em>. Later, they launched the more career-spanning 2-disc <em>Gold</em> series, to compete with <em>The Essential</em>. They've also launched a second Greatest Hits line, <em>Icon</em>, which is a one disc budget compilation like the <em>20th Century Masters</em>, which they're still producing anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Some musicians focus on creating singles, mixtapes, or collaborative tracks to the extent that they can (and have) <em>legitimately</em> put out a Best Of compilation as their debut album. These include:
<ul><li> Chamillionaire
</li><li> Perfume
</li></ul></li><li> And some musicians name their debut album <em>Greatest Hits</em> purely as a joke:
<ul><li> The Cockney Rejects, who went a step further and titled their next two albums <em>Greatest Hits Volume 2</em> and <em>Greatest Hits Volume 3</em>.
</li><li> Mrs. Miller (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a>, in 1966). What makes it funnier is that her next album was called <em>Will Success Spoil Mrs. Miller?</em>; said "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">success</a>" came from her "greatest hits" album and not the other way around.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlienAntFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlienAntFarm">Alien Ant Farm</a>
</li><li> Graveyard BBQ
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JagaJazzist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JagaJazzist">Jaga Jazzist</a>. For extra irony points, the band now considers the album, <em>Jævla Jazzist Grete Stitz</em>, to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a>.
</li><li> Goldie Lookin Chain
</li><li> Reggie And The Full Effect's <em>Greatest Hits 19841987</em> - a further joke is that, despite the dates in the title, it was recorded in 1998.
</li><li> The Cleanliness &amp; Godliness Skiffle Band, in 1968, which turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneBookAuthor">the only album they released under their own name</a> (they also recorded the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeRealTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeRealTurn">infamous</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masked_Marauders">Masked Marauders<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> album a year later).
</li></ul></li><li> Several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject">Hello! Project</a> artists. Most of these include at least one new song.
<ul><li> Morning Musume had two, as well as a singles collection (even though they're still releasing).
</li><li> Goto Maki.
</li><li> Matsuura Aya.
</li><li> Viyuden, shortly before they broke up.
</li><li> C-ute are about to release one.
</li><li> Berryz Koubou had a best of album and a mini-best.
</li><li> Maeda Yuki is releasing one in September.
</li><li> The Pucchi Best albums are compliations of songs put out each year by the groups.
</li><li> The Mega Bests.
</li><li> Country Musume released two of them.
</li><li> Abe Natsumi.
</li><li> Tanpopo.
</li><li> Pucchimoni.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEagles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheEagles">The Eagles</a>' <em>Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975)</em> is the best-selling album in U.S. history and the second best-selling album in the world, having claimed both titles in 2018. <em>Their Greatest Hits</em> was actually the best-selling album in America just shortly after its release, and held onto the title for nearly three decades; the only reason it temporarily lost the title in 2009 was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">died.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>'s <em>Greatest Hits</em> is the best-selling album of all time in Britain, with their <em>Greatest Hits II</em> being number 8. Since then, Queen has released four more albums, including the double-platinum <em>Absolute Greatest</em> in 2009.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a> Gold</em> is the third best selling album of all time in Britain.
<ul><li> Their first UK <em>Greatest Hits</em> album actually served as an introduction to the group for British audience - with only a few exceptions, the songs hadn't been hits in the UK (in fact, many hadn't been released there at all) but <em>had</em> been hits in Sweden and other countries. So the title wasn't <em>strictly</em> a lie...
</li><li> <em>ABBA Gold</em> was largely been supplanted by 2001's <em>The Definitive Collection</em>, which included all of their singles in chronological order. This was <em>also</em> later supplanted by the now-definitive <em>The Essential Collection</em> from 2012, which adds four additional songs. And yet, <em>ABBA Gold</em> is still in print and is still selling, in part because it's available at a cheaper price point than the 2 CD singles collection.
</li></ul></li><li> Anecdotal evidence in British Pop Music suggests when a band releases a greatest hits album, in most cases after three or four studio albums, it is to be taken taken as a sign that the band are about to split up. Examples include greatest hits albums by Atomic Kitten, Steps, S Club 7, Blue, Take That and Girls Aloud.
</li><li> Some bands refuse to release a greatest hits album, notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ACDC">AC/DC</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a> also has refused to do such a compilation, but upon their departure from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParlophoneRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParlophoneRecords">Parlophone Records</a>, <em>Radiohead: The Best of</em> was released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">without their cooperation</a>.
<ul><li> On the other hand, Metallica has <em>S&amp;M</em>, which as live albums go, doubles as a greatest hits collection complete with brand new songs
</li><li> And AC/DC has two soundtrack albums that double as compilations, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaximumOverdrive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MaximumOverdrive">Who Made Who</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2">Iron Man 2</a></em>.
</li><li> Until 2012, AC/DC took this trope up to eleven by refusing to licence their music to iTunes as iTunes allows individual song purchases and the band wish their music to only be available as complete albums (aside from the two soundtracks previously mentioned), so you can't (legally) even compile your own greatest hits collection without purchasing the actual albums.
</li><li> Make that Up to Twelve for AC/DC, who wouldn't even release individual songs for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBand">Rock Band</a></em> because it would compromise the integrity of the album and forced Harmonix to release it as its own disc for the game. The album in question is a live album that, incidentally, features most of their big hits.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Best of Young MC</em> is notable for basically being his first album, with a different title, and three fewer songs. In other words, whoever organized this compilation thought that Young MC ran out of creativity 10/13 of the way through his first album, but deemed a greatest hits album necessary anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCompleteHotFiveAndHotSevenRecordings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCompleteHotFiveAndHotSevenRecordings">The Complete Hot Five and Hot Seven Recordings</a></em>, compiles all the recordings by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LouisArmstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> and his Hot Five and Hot Seven bands. It's a genuine pearl because this is the blueprint for all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz">Jazz</a> and popular music to come afterwards.
</li><li> The 1991 compilation album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StarTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StarTime">Star Time</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesBrown">James Brown</a> consists of four CD's with the best from his entire career. It has been acclaimed as the most essential James Brown album ever!
</li><li> Men at Work has three studio albums and nine "Greatest Hits" albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CreedenceClearwaterRevival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a> released two compilation albums in the late 70's after the band broke up, <em>Chronicle</em> (which was re-released in the early 90's) that contained all their big hits like Proud Mary, Bad Moon Rising, Down on the Corner, etc., and <em>Chronicle II</em>, which contained a lot of lesser known hits from the end of their career, as well as Album Filler.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoniMitchell">Joni Mitchell</a> resisted releasing a greatest hits album for many years, reportedly fearing that the availability of a greatest hits compilation would lead her record label to take her actual studio albums out of print, but she agreed to release <em>Hits</em> in 1996 along with a second album titled <em>Misses</em>, which compiled non-hit songs that Mitchell personally selected as being representative of her work.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AyumiHamasaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AyumiHamasaki">Ayumi Hamasaki</a> released her first best album, <em>A Best</em>, only three years after her debut, despite only having 3 albums and 7 singles. There are rumors about she refusing to do it because she saw that it was the subtle way of her record company to say that this was the end of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> career; when the thing seemed inevitable she acceded, but only if they let her re-record her first couple of singles because her voice had maturated since she recorded them. Since all the photos on that album depicts her with a tear, it raised <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a> about what she really thought of the whole thing. Ironically, <em>A Best</em> fired her career further.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira">Shakira</a> got her own Greatest Hits in Spanish after four albums... but only songs from the latter two made it, because the two first were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">commercial failures full of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>...
</li><li> J-pop group Glay, after <em>two</em> Best Of albums (one of them double!), released a two-volume, two-disc-each compilation titled <em>rare collectives</em> compiling all the B-sides of their singles to date (most of which hadn't made into any album), plus some live recordings and a couple of version and cooperations with other artists.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> had several: first the Red (<em>1962-1966</em>) and Blue (<em>1967-1970</em>) albums (recently re-released), then <em>20 Greatest Hits</em> (which never made CD, although the more recent <em>1</em> is basically an expanded version of it), the quasi-best-of singles-only <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PastMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PastMasters">Past Masters</a></em> (re-released with the 2009 remastered albums) as it compiles everything that wasn't released on an album including important stuff like "I Want To Hold Your Hand" and "Hey Jude" — although not truly a "best of", as, being collected singles, it also features non-hit B-sides; and finally 2000's <em>1</em>, the best selling album of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The2000s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/The2000s">The Naughties</a>, which batted 1.000 because every song on it had hit #1 on either the British or the American charts (like <em>20 Greatest Hits</em> before it).
<ul><li> As early as 1966, their British label (Parlophone) released one of these: <em>A Collection of Beatles Oldies</em>. In addition, companies in various countries around the world issued their own "best of" collections around the same period.
</li><li> There was also, late in 1980, <em>The Beatles Box</em>, issued in the UK, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">box-set</a> of <em>eight</em> newly-compiled LPs, giving it <em>twice</em> the scope of the Red and Blue sets combined, expanding on the "best of" concept to include all the "better" songs from their albums, as well as bona-fide hits — along the way the set included some "odd versions" of songs, like the US-stereo version of "I'm Looking Through You" with extra opening notes, plus "Penny Lane" featuring the 7-note trumpet coda in a stereo version, and a composite version of "I Am the Walrus", both of which Capitol in the US had created earlier that year for their US version of <em>Rarities</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> released one greatest hits album while he was alive, <em>Shaved Fish</em>. That one was infamous for having short versions of singles that never charted. A fair percentage of his post-mortem releases are also greatest hits albums. "The John Lennon Collection" was a bit strange because half the songs on it were from <em>Double Fantasy,</em> and most of John's half of <em>Double Fantasy</em> was on that album.
<ul><li> It may have had something to do with Capitol releasing the compilation, but Geffen having released <em>Double Fantasy</em> itself.
</li><li> Lennon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">mentioned in a 1980 interview</a> that it was a struggle to even get <em>Shaved Fish</em> out <em>at all</em>, and that the main reason behind the album was that Capitol was in the process of phasing out a lot of John's music, in particular rare non-album tracks like "Power To The People", and that Lennon just wanted to make sure that his music was available at all while he was taking his five-year break from
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> has several. There is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Wings">Wings</a> Greatest</em>, released in 1978. There is <em>All The Best!</em> released in 1988; there are significant differences between the British and American versions of that album, as Paul has different hits in each country. (The British version also had a few new songs; the American version didn't, but the hit ratio was high.) In 2001, Paul released <em>Wingspan,</em> which was half a greatest-hits album from 1970 to 1985 and half "history" (some of which also charted decently). It cost no more than a normal single CD, but Capitol Records had flooded the market with <em>All The Best!</em> CDs immediately prior), so it wasn't fully appreciated. In 2016, he released <em>Pure McCartney</em>, which supplanted all previous collections and was made available in 2 or 4-CD iterations.
</li><li> Capitol Records released a greatest hits CD for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeHarrison">George Harrison</a> when he left for his own Dark Horse label, which interestingly, contained songs from his days with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>. This annoyed Harrison, since all the other Beatles, Ringo included, had gotten a compilation devoted entirely to their output as solo artists.
<ul><li> Years later George released his all-solo <em>Best of Dark Horse</em>.
</li><li> Capitol would release the career-spanning "Let It Roll: Songs By George Harrison" posthumously in 2009.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RingoStarr">Ringo Starr</a> has released a couple of these. His first, <em>Blast from the Past</em>, is highly valued because it has a much higher hit ratio than the albums it collected from, as well as a few songs that up to then had been singles-only. He released another one called <em>Photograph</em> in 2007, but it didn't get much publicity.
</li><li> A weird subversion: The 1965 album <em>Best of the Beatles</em> does not contain any of the Beatles' hit songs, or any songs by the Beatles at all. It's an album of original songs by Pete Best, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">(formerly) of the Beatles</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A cursory look at Amazon.com reveals that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis">Bruce Willis</a> has released <em>four</em> greatest hits albums for his less than stellar recording career. One of which uses the same cover art as his actual album.
</li><li> Famed J-rock duo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bz">B'z</a> is a interesting case: They had released several "compilations" albums that, in practice, are like Greatest Hits albums since they compiled all their singles... but still hadn't released any <em>official</em> Greatest Hits Albums yet. To muddle the waters more, some of those compilations feature re-recordings of two of their signature songs, actualized for the year of release.
</li><li> Despite the fact they never actually had a hit song, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VelvetUnderground">Velvet Underground</a> have two of these. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Velvet-Underground-Words-Music/dp/B000001FR9/ref=sr_1_27?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1231629458&amp;sr=1-27">One<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is considered generally inferior due to picking almost all of their most conventional songs; <a class="urllink" href="http://www.amazon.com/20th-Century-Masters-Millennium-Underground/dp/B00004YX3S/ref=pd_sim_m_16">the second<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was more well-received.
</li><li> Progressive metal band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DreamTheater">Dream Theater</a> released a compilation to satisfy a contract with their now former label. Since the band only had one radio hit (the rock radio favorite "Pull Me Under") and have built their career without 'hit singles', the album is jokingly titled <em>Dream Theater's Greatest Hit (and 21 other pretty cool songs</em>).
<ul><li> They also use some <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dreamtheaterarg.com.ar/imagenes/discos/greatesthit.jpg">clever red highlighting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> to quite literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">sneak some crap past the radar</a> as to their thoughts on the matter.
</li></ul></li><li> An interesting case: the biggest hits of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RedHotChiliPeppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>' EMI years (which were not noted for being much of a success) were collected on an album after the success of <em>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</em>; the result was entitled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">What Hits?</a></em>. It also included their breakthrough single after signing with Warner Records, "Under the Bridge". In return, the WEA compilation <em>Greatest Hits</em> - which does feature successful singles - features the one EMI song that hit the charts, the cover of "Higher Ground".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeffersonAirplane">Jefferson Airplane</a> called their first best-of release <em>The Worst of Jefferson Airplane</em>.
<ul><li> Peter Schickele has <em>The Wurst of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PDQBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PDQBach">P.D.Q. Bach</a></em> (The cover of which shows the titular composer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualPun">examining a large sausage</a>).
</li><li> A collection of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CultureClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CultureClub">Culture Club</a> and Boy George hits was titled <em>At Worst... The Best of Boy George and Culture Club</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Comedian/singers Rodney Carrington and Tim Wilson both have a "Greatest Hits" album. Both men have only two chart singles to their credit each, with nothing higher than #60.
</li><li> Inverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis' Greatest Shit!!</a></em>, an infamous bootleg compilation of studio recordings and outtakes representing the absolute worst of Elvis Presley's career. The producer of the album, known only as "Richard," stated that the purpose of the album was to serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against Presley's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter">post-mortem deification</a>, providing an unapologetically tasteless reminder that even artists as highly revered as Presley can't realistically have a 100% perfect output.
</li><li> A particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example: When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GarthBrooks">Garth Brooks</a> assumed the alter ego of Chris Gaines, his first and only album under the Chris Gaines pseudonym was widely called "Greatest Hits" (though its actual name was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InTheLifeOfChrisGaines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/InTheLifeOfChrisGaines">Garth Brooks in... The Life of Chris Gaines</a></em>). The whole album acted as if Gaines was already an established singer with several pop hits under his belt, even listing a fake backstory and chart positions in the liner notes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyTalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyTalent">Billy Talent</a> got one in 2014, with an additional two new tracks, "Chasing The Sun" and "Kingdom of Zod".
</li><li> As an indication of how insanely popular Elton John was in the 70s, he put out a greatest hits set a mere four years after his first successful single, and a second greatest hits set just two years after that. And unbelievably, neither set contained any filler.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceSpringsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s first greatest hits album, although a huge seller, was widely criticized by hardcore fans for containing too many new songs (four of them), causing some huge hits like "I'm on Fire" and "Cover Me" to be excluded.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> had several of these.
<ul><li> Motown has released several compilations of his pre-<em>Off The Wall</em> solo tunes over the decades. As they often bear generic titles like <em>The Michael Jackson Anthology</em>, many have probably been confused and/or disappointed to see songs like "Got To Be There" and "Ben" instead of "Beat It" and "Billie Jean".
</li><li> <em>HIStory - Past, Present and Future Book I</em> (1995) drew criticism for the way it was compiled. It was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctDoubleAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistinctDoubleAlbum">Distinct Double Album</a>: Disc One featured his Epic Records-era greatest hits and Disc Two featured new material. This irked people who wanted one but not both; casual fans (and critics!) didn't care about the new material aside from the singles, while hardcore fans already owned all the hits, all of which were the album edits to boot. Disc One was reissued on its own in 2001, but people who want the other tracks (especially the hit singles from the second disc like "You Are Not Alone", "Scream" and "Stranger in Moscow") still have to buy the full two-disc set. The story goes that Sony and Jackson's original plan was just to bring out a greatest hits set with a few new tracks (a project that had been in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a> since 1989), but after the first round of child molestation allegations against him he came up with a ton of new material.
</li><li> <em>Number Ones</em> (2003) was his answer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a> all-#1-hits compilations, though the American version had to stretch beyond the U.S. and British charts to include songs from <em>Invincible</em>. It also included a new song in "One More Chance" that flopped in the U.S. as Jackson was formally charged with child molestation just as the album hit shelves; it did make #1 in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_More_Chance_(Michael_Jackson_song)">a few countries<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, though. The album didn't make waves until the week after Jackson's death, when it <a class="urllink" href="http://www.billboard.com/#/news/michael-jackson-breaks-billboard-charts-1003989310.story">outsold<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the album topping the Billboard 200 (at the time, albums over 18 months old only entered the Catalog Charts; MJ's post-death popularity and the success of the Beatles remasterings caused that rule to be dropped).
</li><li> <em>The Ultimate Collection</em> (2004) was a four-disc hits-and-rarities box set, plus a DVD of a 1992 concert.
</li><li> <em>The Essential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a></em> (2005) was a two-disc set that spanned his entire career: the U.S. version featured ten songs from his Jackson 5/Jacksons days (including early solo work), four <em>Off the Wall</em> songs, seven <em>Thriller</em> songs (the album has nine songs total!), eight <em>Bad</em> songs (out of eleven!), seven <em>Dangerous</em> songs...and <em>one each</em> from <em>HIStory</em> and <em>Invincible</em>. The limited edition's third disc has seven extra songs, four being from the not-so-shiny phase.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw">Tim McGraw</a> has gone through wonkery with <em>two</em> of his greatest-hits albums:
<ul><li> Volume 1 had <em>no new songs</em> to release to radio, almost unheard of for a country greatest-hits album.
</li><li> Curb Records released his <em>third</em> greatest-hits album only <em>one</em> year after his second and with just one album of original material in between. To pad it out, Curb included a couple duets from other albums, as well as most of the singles off his then-current album <em>Let It Go</em>. Tim has even said that he does not acknowledge this album's existence. Fans of the genre have said that this album, combined with a re-package of all three greatest-hits albums, and <em>seven</em> singles off <em>Let It Go</em> (even after singles four and five both tanked), are just a form of stalling, since Tim only has one more album left in his contract and there are <em>no</em> other big country acts on the label.
</li><li> By 2010, Curb had cranked out <em>seven</em> McGraw greatest-hits packages. That, among other examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>, pushed McGraw to fight to leave the label, which he finally did in 2013 after all the lawsuits were settled.
</li></ul></li><li> Doc Cox, as Ivor Biggun, has released two 2-CD compilation albums which together contained every song he's ever released on CD as well as live performances of his favorite. The first album was entitled <em>The Fruity Bits of Ivor Biggun</em> but included three alternate covers with cover art that represented the name: <em>The Breast of Ivor Biggun</em>, <em>The Beast of Ivor Biggun</em>, and <em>The Wurst of Ivor Biggun</em>. The second compilation was simply titled <em>More Fruity Bits! The Rest of Ivor Biggun</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a> have five: <em>Relics</em> (a 1971 collection of early (and mostly non-album) material and the only one that fans actually like), <em>A Collection of Great Dance Songs</em> (a 1981 collection which only included six songs, two of them re-recorded; even the band hates it), <em>Works</em> (a now-obscure 1982 collection featuring Pink Floyd songs from no later than 1973), <em>Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd</em> (a 2001 2-disc collection which did very well, even though die hard fans were upset about the editing of some songs for time constraint) and <em>Foot in the Door</em> (a 2011 single-disc release, which intends to be the one-disc introductory hits package that <em>A Collection of Great Dance Songs</em> attempted and failed to be).
<ul><li> <em>Echoes</em> is particularly notable for how the songs are edited; they form a more-or-less continual flow of music, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadingIntoTheNextSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadingIntoTheNextSong">with one song ending and the next starting seamlessly.</a> Quite impressive construction for a greatest hits album.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GratefulDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GratefulDead">Grateful Dead</a> have five: 1974's contract satisfying <em>Skeletons from the Closet: The Best of the Grateful Dead</em> (which remains their best selling album), the hard-to-find 1977 2-disc <em>What A Long Strange Trip It's Been</em>, 1996's <em>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AristaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AristaRecords">Arista</a> Years</em> (which includes music they made after the material included on <em>Skeletons from the Closet</em>), the career spanning 2003 release <em>The Very Best of the Grateful Dead</em> and the 2015 2-CD set <em>The Best of the Grateful Dead</em> which replaces the 2003 set.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CountingCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CountingCrows">Counting Crows</a>' <em>Films About Ghosts</em>, which spanned the large gap between the release of <em>Hard Candy</em> and <em>Saturday Nights &amp; Sunday Mornings</em>.
</li><li> Jeff Foxworthy played with the title a bit, releasing a compilation called <em>Greatest Bits</em>, which included snippets from some of his comedy sketches.
</li><li> Similarly, phone prankster Roy D. Mercer released a compilation called <em>Greatest Fits</em>.
</li><li> Subverted with Disgaea 2's OST, which had "Best of" as part of the album's name, as well as it being the <em>only</em> one released.
</li><li> While all the songs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Bjork">Björk</a>'s 2002 "Greatest Hits" compilation were singles, the track listing was voted for by fans and omitted (amongst others) what was possibly her best-selling - and probably best-known - single in several countries, "It's Oh So Quiet".
<ul><li> She omitted "It's Oh So Quiet" because she didn't feel that a cover song should be on her greatest hits compilation.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ToriAmos">Tori Amos</a> didn't want to release a greatest hits compilation, so she instead released a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">"sonic autobiography"</a> <em>Tales of a Librarian</em>. In other words, she chose songs she felt told her life story. The majority of the songs on it were singles, but non-single tracks, two new songs, and two re-recorded B-sides were also added.
</li><li> <em>The Best of Electribe 101 featuring Billie Ray Martin</em> is a straight reissue of their debut (and only) album, <em>Electribal Memories</em>, with the new title covering up the old one on the sleeve. Similarly <em>The Best of Flowered Up</em> is just their sole album, <em>A Life With Brian</em>, plus one bonus track (albeit a 13-minute one that bumps up the playing time by nearly a third). And <em>The Best of Betty Boo</em> is her debut, <em>Boomania</em>, in a different order with a couple of 12" mixes thrown in, because the record company didn't own, and couldn't be bothered to license, the rights to her second (and superior) album, <em>Grrr... It's Betty Boo</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> didn't include much previously unavailable material on his <em>The Essential "Weird Al" Yankovic</em> two-disc set, only including a couple mixes of songs not on the original CDs (i.e. the extra-gory version of "The Night Santa Went Crazy" and the single release of UHF), but he did manage to nearly jam-pack each completely full. The cover can appropriately serve as a parody of <em>The Essential Michael Jackson</em>.
<ul><li> Al also had <em>The Food Album</em> and <em>The TV Album</em>, with his songs into those themes. Also, his Greatest Hits Volume 2 featured his Crash Test Dummies parody "Headline News", which had only been previously released as a single and the long-out-of-print "Al in the Box" compilation.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TypeONegative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TypeONegative">Type O Negative</a> had two "best of" albums, one compiled by the band themselves, and another put together by their by-then former record label, both largely covering the same material. In line with the band's occasional use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a>, the former was called <em>The Least Worst of Type O Negative</em>, and started with a completely silent filler track from one of their albums (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">the implication being that</a> they considered <em>39 seconds of silence</em> to be among their best work).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a> has released four such albums so far.
<ul><li> <em>Cirque du Soleil Collection</em> (1996) covered <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LeCirqueReinvente" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LeCirqueReinvente">Le Cirque Réinventé</a></em> through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Alegria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Alegria">Alegría</a></em>.
</li><li> <em>Le Best of...</em> (2004), a tie-in to the company's 20th anniversary, was an update of the previous album that dropped all the songs from shows that had closed and added ones from those that had since opened, up through <em>Varekai</em>.
</li><li> <em>25</em> (2009) tied into the company's <em>25th</em> anniversary and featured a fresh tracklist over two CDs. With the exceptions of <em>Pomp Duck and Circumstance</em> (which Cirque only co-produced, rather than created in-house) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">unique case</a> of <em>LOVE</em>, every live show through <em>OVO</em> was represented, even those that didn't yet have soundtrack albums (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CrissAngelBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CrissAngelBelieve">Criss Angel BeLIEve</a></em>, <em>ZED</em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OVO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/OVO">OVO</a></em>). The earliest shows' songs hadn't appeared on CD until this album.
</li><li> <em>Le Best of...2</em> (2012) followed on from the 2004 collection by catching up with most of the shows from <em>Zumanity</em> onwards.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeanMichelJarre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JeanMichelJarre">Jean-Michel Jarre</a> had a whole number of these: <em>The Essential</em> (7" versions from 1976 to 1985), <em>Musik aus Zeit und Raum</em> (pretty much ditto), <em>Images - The Best Of Jean Michel Jarre</em> (partly edited, partly re-recorded, partly remixed live versions from 1976 to 1990 + a few unreleased tracks), <em>The Essential Jean Michel Jarre</em> (1976 to 2000 including some not really Greatest Hits, not released by Jarre himself but by Francis Dreyfus), <em>Aero</em> (mostly re-recorded material from 1976 to 1997 + a few new tracks).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSpecials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSpecials">The Specials</a> released seven albums, but they had more than twice as many greatest hits compilations, all of which seem to consist of songs from the first two albums, the Special AKA Live EP and the tracks included on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GhostTown">Ghost Town</a> single (although all of these singles were top ten hits).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Devo">Devo</a> released two compilations at the same tine: <em>Devo's Greatest Hits</em> (a compilation of their better-known works) and <em>Devo's Greatest Misses</em> (a compilation of their weirder stuff, much of which was otherwise out of print at the time).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JethroTull">Jethro Tull</a> have plenty. The most notable are: <em>Living In The Past</em>, a double-album selection of singles, B-sides, outtakes, live tracks from a Carnegie Hall concert, and assorted album tracks. The more conventional <em>M.U.: The Best Of Jethro Tull</em> and <em>Repeat: The Best Of Jethro Tull</em> followed in 1974 and 1977 respectively. <em>Original Masters</em> was released in 1985, filling in for a break in action between 1985 and 1987. The band released <em>The Best Of Jethro Tull-The Anniversary Collection</em>, a two-CD collection with remastered hits across their career up to that point, in 1993. 1998 saw a short compilation, <em>Through The Years</em>, an odd assortment of album tracks and live recordings. <em>The Very Best Of Jethro Tull</em>, a single-disc, career-length selection hand-picked by bandleader Ian Anderson, was released in 2001. Finally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">self-explanatory</a> <em>The Best Of Acoustic Jethro Tull</em> was released in 2007.
<ul><li> Another limitation of the genre was demonstrated when <em>Living In The Past</em>, originally a double LP, was re-issued as a single CD. Fans were not best impressed when a double LP containing around 100 minutes of music was unsympathetically edited to fit the constraints of a single CD - which was limited to 87 minutes. Whole tracks were omitted and others severely edited.
</li></ul></li><li> Starting with 1995's <em>Best of the Beast</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a> releases one every three years. They include <em>Somewhere Back in Time</em>, focusing on the 1980's "golden years" - and in the order the songs would be in a live concert's setlist - and <em>From Fear to Eternity</em>, encompassing the albums between 1990 and 2010 (though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">Blaze Bayley</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">albums</a> are represented by live versions with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceDickinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BruceDickinson">Bruce Dickinson</a>).
<ul><li> A particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scrappy">Scrappy</a> example is the <em>Edward The Great</em> compilation. Despite the commendable cover artwork it adds to the Maiden library, the album is severely unbalanced: a full half of the <em>Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son</em> album is included, yet not a single cut with original singer Di'Anno's voice made it onto the compilation.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a> has released <em>nine</em> so far. Two were released by the recording companies after the band was out (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaRecords">Columbia Records</a>'s <em>Gems</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeffenRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeffenRecords">Geffen Records</a>'s <em>Young Lust</em>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RebaMcEntire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RebaMcEntire">Reba McEntire</a>, one of the greatest stars in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic">Country Music</a> history, has released three conventional "Greatest Hits" albums and a three-disc showstopper entitled <em>Reba: 50 Greatest Hits</em>. And that's just for starters. She's also released CDs containing only her #1 singles, and then there was the mandatory "Millennium Collection." This is fully justified, as she has had no less than <strong>eighty</strong> Top 40 singles during her career, <em>thirty</em> of which peaked at #1.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheResidents">The Residents</a> subverted this with <em>Our Finest Flowers</em>. Rather than releasing a standard greatest hits album, they took a long-standing tradition of messing around with existing music, and applied it to their own. The result was an album full of brand new songs that consisted of mashed-up songs from previous albums. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> tells us that this happened because a Resident vomited on a track listing for a greatest hits album that was being planned.
<ul><li> Played relatively straight with their later compilation <em>Petting Zoo</em>: The only things approaching "hits" the band has to begin with are their covers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HankWilliams">"Kaw-Liga"</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">"Satisfaction"</a>, neither of which were included, but the album did attempt to showcase the band's more accessible moments in reverse chronological order. They even pulled a variation on the practice of including new songs as fan bait - the first two tracks served as a preview of <em>Demons Dance Alone</em>, which came out later that same year.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanHalen">Van Halen</a> released one before reuniting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidLeeRoth">David Lee Roth</a> (<em>Best Of Volume I</em>) and another reuniting with Sammy Hagar (<em>Best of Both Worlds</em>, which was double to be more comprehensive... but had a random tracklisting that frequently alternates Sammy and Dave).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Oasis">Oasis</a> had two, one with an active band and songs picked by Noel Gallagher (which explains why all but four tracks are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstInstallmentWins">from the first two albums</a> or B-sides of those songs, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">the third album has no tracks</a>), and another after disbanding, with the singles per se.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yes">Yes</a> have 7 "official" greatest hits albums, many of them dedicated to a specific stint on a label. Three or four of them are double-disc comilations, some of which are repackagings. Many of them were released after their last studio album, 2000's <em>Magnification</em>, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RhinoRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RhinoRecords">Rhino Records</a>, who owns their Atlantic Records recordings. That's not to count the boxed sets and "friends of Yes" best -ofs, or the unofficial collections.
</li><li> The 1974 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperGroup">Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young</a> album <em>So Far</em> consists of songs from the <em>two</em> studio LP's they'd recorded to that point (1969's <em>Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash</em> and 1970's <em>Déjà Vu</em>), plus the breakout single <em>Ohio</em> and its B-side <em>Find the Cost of Freedom</em>. Sounds like a totally unnecessary endeavor, right? But it bats a respectable .454 on the Brunching Shuttlecocks metric (5 of the 11 songs on it hit the top 40), and fans were so eager for CSNY that <em>So Far</em> reached #1 on the charts and sold its way into Gold Record status.
</li><li> Cracker had the two-disc <em>Garage D'or</em> - the first disc had most of their singles, while the second was b-sides, compilation tracks, and unreleased material, rounded out with live versions of a few fan favorites. Later on there would also be an unusual case of dueling Greatest Hits albums: The band had recorded <em>Greatest Hits Redux</em>, an album of studio re-recordings of their hits that they planned to release on an independent label, then they found out about Virgin, their old label, planning to release <em>Get On With It: The Best Of Cracker</em> without their involvement. They brazenly put the re-recorded versions out earlier than planned to compete with the regular greatest hits album.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCorrs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCorrs">The Corrs</a> have <em>three</em> <em>and</em> a complete collection <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedSet">Boxed Set</a> of all 5 albums which released in 2011. Although once you start adding the high quality live albums and unplugged albums which have their own specific songs it looks far more reasonable. A buyer also gets more value for money from each subsequent release. The first was made after their 3rd album was released and has 18 songs. The second <em>Dreams</em> contained 21 songs and was released after their 4th and 5th albums were released as well as several unplugged and live albums. <em>The Works</em> was released as a three CD set with 56 tracks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Curve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Curve">Curve</a> ended their career with <em>The Way Of Curve</em>, a two-disc set (one disc of greatest hits, one disc of rarities) limited to 10,000 copies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FaithNoMore">Faith No More</a> had a few after the band split, with the most recent, done to promote their reunion, mixing all names used for such compilations for parody's sake: <em>The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisCostello">Elvis Costello</a> has <em>The Best Of Elvis Costello And The Attractions</em> from 1985, the double <em>Girls Girls Girls</em> in 1987, Rykodisc's <em>The Very Best Of Elvis Costello And The Attractions</em> double-disc from 1994, <em>Extreme Honey</em> in 1997 (which compiles his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords">Warner (Bros.) Records</a> years (1989-94)), <em>The Very Best Of Elvis Costello</em> (double-disc, 2001), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Rock &amp; Roll Music</a></em> (2007), <em>The Best Of Elvis Costello: The First Ten Years</em> (2007), and <em>Pomp And Pout</em> (chronicling his stint on Universal Records ((1998-2008))). Not to mention the rarities compilations <em>Taking Liberties</em> (aka <em>10 Bloody Marys And Ten How's Yer Fathers</em> in the UK) and <em>Out Of Our Idiot</em>, the boxed set <em>2 1/2 Years</em>, featuring his first three studio albums and a rare live 1979 recording, and three recent boxed sets of his singles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starflyer59" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Starflyer59">Starflyer 59</a>'s greatest-hits album <em>Easy Come, Easy Go</em> almost seemed lazy in its track choices. It featured exactly three songs from each of the band's five prior albums—specifically, the first two tracks plus either track 3 or track 4. Fortunately, it also came with a second disc, filled with b-sides and live tracks, and the liner notes had an impressively thorough history of the band.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JarsOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JarsOfClay">Jars of Clay</a>'s <em>Furthermore</em> was practically a greatest-hits collection, but it was completely new recordings. Disc one featured stripped-down acoustic versions of the songs, and disc two featured live versions. Five years later, they ended up releasing a more conventional <em>Greatest Hits</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> had <em>many</em> compilations assembled over the course of his career, partially because he label-hopped a fair deal early on and those ex-labels reassembled what they had once his career took off. As for Bowie-supervised anthologies:
<ul><li> <em>Changesonebowie</em> (1976) and <em>Changestwobowie</em> (1981) were the first compilations that brought together his career-making hits. When a rerelease program of Bowie's 1969-80 catalog was initiated in 1990, <em>Changesbowie</em> — the cover of which incorporated the <em>Changesonebowie</em> cover photo — arrived; it also included EMI-era songs from 1983's <em>Let's Dance</em> and 1984's <em>Tonight</em>, and instead of "Fame" (his first U.S. Number One) the then-new rearrangement "Fame '90" was substituted. The remix was not well received, and it was replaced by the original when <em>Changesbowie</em> was reissued in 1996.
</li><li> 1989's <em>Sound + Vision</em> box set covered 1969-1980 with a focus on deeper cuts and originally included a Video CD (later CD-Rom) of three live numbers and the "Ashes to Ashes" video on top of three audio CDs. A 2003 reissue turned it into a four-CD set with material from 1982-93 and a 1997 live B-side added.
</li><li> 1993's <em>The Singles Collection</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singles_Collection_(David_Bowie_album)">wasn't exactly truth in advertising<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — a bunch of the included songs weren't singles or, if they were, the actual single edits.
</li><li> Three best-ofs available separately or as <em>The Platinum Collection</em> specifically focus on 1969-74 (mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlamRock">Glam Rock</a>), 1975-79 (blue-eyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Soul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Soul">Soul</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Krautrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Krautrock">Krautrock</a>), and 1980-87 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewWaveMusic">New Wave Music</a>, pop rock, and soundtracks). The last one is notable for bringing together single versions of his movie theme songs from this period, which at five outpace the number of included tracks from his studio albums <em>Tonight</em> and <em>Never Let Me Down</em> (four).
</li><li> 2002's <em>Best of Bowie</em> had <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_Bowie">20 different versions prepared<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for 21 different countries based on which songs were most successful in them, plus a two-disc DVD set released alongside it.
</li><li> 2008's <em>iSelect</em>, which is unique in that it features a tracklist selected by Bowie himself, and is a collection of his personal favorites of his own songs. It includes only one of his big hits, "Life on Mars?", and has a special, exclusive version of "Time Will Crawl" with a newly recorded backing track. This track would become even more notable in 2018 for serving as the starting point for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeverLetMeDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeverLetMeDown">Never Let Me Down 2018</a></em>.
</li><li> 2014's 3-disc <em>Nothing Has Changed</em> presents its songs in reverse chronological order, starting with the set-exclusive single "Sue (or In a Season of Crime)" and working all the way back to his first single, 1964's "Liza Jane", making this the first Bowie-assembled compilation to include pre-"Space Oddity" material. Along the way, remixes, single edits, and other rarities pop up, including three selections from his unreleased album <em>Toy</em>. A 2-disc version, with its tracklist in regular chronological order, is also available
</li><li> 2016's <em>Bowie Legacy</em>, which largely repeats the tracklist of the 2-disc version of <em>Nothing Has Changed</em>, only adding on a couple alternate single edits, a single from <em>Heathen</em> and two songs from his final album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackstarAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackstarAlbum">★</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BradPaisley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BradPaisley">Brad Paisley</a> fought against the release of one for several years, because he thought that it was unfair to make an album composed of something that the fans already have. The label finally compromised and let him release a two-disc set which features his greatest hits on one disc and an assortment of live tracks on the other.
</li><li> Country music artist Phil Vassar did an interesting variation. Since he had several hits as a songwriter before he had any as a singer (and some for at least a year after his singing career began), his Greatest Hits includes both his own songs and his versions of some of his pre-fame songs (namely "I'm Alright" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoDeeMessina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoDeeMessina">Jo Dee Messina</a>, "My Next Thirty Years" and "For a Little While" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMcGraw">Tim McGraw</a> and "Little Red Rodeo" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CollinRaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CollinRaye">Collin Raye</a>).
</li><li> Mary Chapin Carpenter mixed hers up; <em>Party Doll</em> is a mix of live hits, studio versions, and a few of her personal favorites.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ladytron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ladytron">Ladytron</a> released <em>Best of 00-10</em> which has two exclusive tracks, "Ace of Hz" (which would later appear on their subsequent album <em>Gravity the Seducer</em>) and "Little Black Angel" (a cover of Death in June).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> avoided releasing one for a number of years, until the 1990 4-CD box set of their greatest hits. They also have the two-volume set <em>Early Days</em> and <em>Later Days,</em> which are superseded by <em>Mothership,</em> which contains a DVD of live performances in the deluxe edition. The tracklists on both these compilations are almost identical, but neither compilation includes songs from <em>Coda,</em> the band's last studio album. Presumably, this is because <em>Coda</em> "didn't count" as an album due to it being made up of outtakes and songs rejected from inclusion on studio albums due to time constraints. The comprehensive <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Complete Led Zeppelin</a></em> also exists, which includes several songs not released on the studio albums at all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> is a big believer in this. Eleven Greatest Hits (inc. 2 Japanese-only releases), nine live albums, and 5 box sets. Not bad for a band who's only had 6 top-20 songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> loves this as well. They have released five greatest hits albums as well as three box sets.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a> have several greatest hits or best of albums, but the three that had actual input from the band were <em>Eponymous</em>, <em>In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 19882003</em> and <em> And I Feel Fine... The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982-1987</em>. <em>And I Feel Fine</em> was apparently meant to supplant <em>Eponymous</em>, since it's a more exhaustive compilation of the same period, though <em>Eponymous</em> is still the only place the song "Romance" is available on CD. <em>In Time</em> included the new recordings "Bad Day" (actually a revamped version of an old outtake) and "Animal", and a limited edition had an extra disc of b-sides from the same period. What <em>In Time</em> conspicuously <em>didn't</em> have was "Shiny Happy People", one of their best-known singles: They've still got a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">Creator Backlash</a> for that song, apparently.
<ul><li> A fourth official greatest hits album <em>Part Lies Part Heart Part Truth Part Garbage</em>, was announced a week after the band's 2011 disbanding. This one is their first career-spanning disc and features some new songs and a couple album tracks thrown in here and there. Also, "Shiny Happy People" is on it for some unexplained reason. (For those who like the song, one could argue its reason for being present was that it did well as a radio single. For those who dislike the song, well, the album title does say <em>Part Garbage</em>.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KodaKumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KodaKumi">KodaKumi</a> is infamous for these. Right after her first best-of compilation (which massively boosted her popularity), she released twelve singles in twelve weeks, all of which were put together (with an intro and one new track) and marketed as a second best-of album, only half a year later. A year after THAT, only a few months after releasing a studio album, her third best-of compilation was released as a CD + DVD collection, featuring ballads on the CD, and all-dance reshoots of her more uptempo songs on the DVD. Two studio albums later, she released a collaboration best-of, a remix album, and her third best-of album, coupled with her eighth studio album, followed by another remix album. She released <em>yet another</em> remix album in early 2011. In short, she has almost as many compilations as she does studio albums.
</li><li> J-pop singer Nana Tanimura released her debut album four years after her first single, having released ''seven' more singles following, two of which were double a-sides. Her debut album wound up being a best-of with a number of b-sides tossed in for good measure.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CamperVanBeethoven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CamperVanBeethoven">Camper Van Beethoven</a> have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongTitle">Popular Songs of Great Enduring Strength and Beauty</a></em>, which covers their career up until their initial breakup in 1990 (meaning nothing was included from <em>New Roman Times</em>, which was their newest album at the time, or their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum">Cover Album</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s <em>Tusk</em>). The band couldn't license anything from <em>Key Lime Pie</em> and <em>Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart</em>, the two albums they released while on Virgin, so the album uses brand new re-recordings of four of it's songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MarilynManson">Marilyn Manson</a>'s <em>Lest We Forget: The Best Of</em>, which covers the first ten years of their career. Songs were generally mixed louder than on the albums (although not to the point of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudnessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudnessWar">Loudness War</a>), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadingIntoTheNextSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadingIntoTheNextSong">Fading into the Next Song</a> was occasionally used where it wasn't originally. There were a couple of non-album singles ("The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell" and "Tainted Love") and a newly recorded cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DepecheMode">Depeche Mode</a>'s "Personal Jesus", but charting single "I Don't Like The Drugs (But The Drugs Like Me)" was absent. At the time they called it a "farewell album", but after a gap of a few years they kept releasing music.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePolice">The Police</a>'s first greatest hits album, <em>Every Breath You Take: The Singles</em>, got a little bit of a mixed reception for having a few of their hits absent and including a new, drastically different version of "Don't Stand So Close To Me" instead of the original. It got deleted and replaced with the similarly titled <em>Every Breath You Take: The Classics</em>, which was almost identical but included the original "Don't Stand So Close To Me", relegating "Don't Stand So Close To Me 86" to the end of the album alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix">The Not-Remix</a> of "Message In A Bottle". There's been a few more greatest hits albums since, including a two cd collection called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfTitledAlbum">The Police</a></em>, and <em>The Very Best Of Sting And The Police</em>, which of course mixed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sting">Sting</a> solo hits in with his Police material. The original version of that last one featured a remix of "Roxanne" by Puff Daddy (probably to capitalize on Puff Daddy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">sampling up</a> "Every Breath You Take" the previous year), while a later reissue ditched the remix and added more previously released songs - three by Sting and one by The Police.
</li><li> The Cult have two official best of albums, <em>Pure Cult</em> and <em>High Octane Cult</em>, but both are pretty much identical in terms of song selection. The only difference is that <em>High Octane Cult</em> adds two new songs and "Star", the only single they'd released in the three years between the two compilations. "Star" would later show up on a re-release of <em>Pure Cult</em>, but those two new tracks wouldn't.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ministry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ministry">Ministry</a>'s <em>Greatest Fits</em> and <em>Rantology</em>: One includes the original or single versions of most of it's songs and also features "What About Us?" (originally from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AIArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AIArtificialIntelligence">A.I.: Artificial Intelligence</a></em>) and a slightly extended version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">"Supernaut"</a> cover originally credited to 1,000 Homo DJs. About half of the other is new remixes or "updates" of old songs, and at the time "The Great Satan" was an exclusive track, but a version later appeared on <em>Rio Grande Blood</em>. Neither, of course, include anything from their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop">Synth-Pop</a> period.
</li><li> Duck Sauce subverts this by naming their first (and only) EP, <em>Greatest Hits</em>.
</li><li> Similarly, Reggie And The Full Effect called their debut <em>Greatest Hits 1984-1987</em>. Part of the joke is also that the album was released in 1999 - the band didn't even <em>exist</em> in 1984.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Silverchair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Silverchair">Silverchair</a>'s <em>The Best Of, Volume 1</em>, which was put out without the band's approval once they left Sony, and thus only covers the first three albums. It came in a couple of different editions - one included a separate disc of b-sides and rarities, while the other crammed the hits and most of those same non-album tracks onto the same cd.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GreenDay">Green Day</a>'s <em>International Superhits</em>, which covered their singles from 1994 to 2000 - presumably their two pre-major label albums weren't counted because of licensing issues, but those didn't have any proper singles anyway. The album has every song they released as a single during this period in chronological order, and also starts off with a pair of token new songs.
<ul><li> In 2017, they released a second hits collection, <em>Greatest Hits: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">God's Favorite Band</a></em>. This one also has the songs in chronological order, including a truncated selection of singles that had previously appeared on <em>International Superhits!</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> As a band with many popular non-album singles (as well as hits that <em>do</em> appear on their albums, but not in the version that became popular), it's no surprise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a> has a small clutch of greatest hits collections. The first, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SubstanceNewOrderAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SubstanceNewOrderAlbum">Substance</a></em> - the band's best selling album - contains all of the A and B sides to the group's 12" singles up to 1987 (including the new songs "True Faith" and "1963"). 1994's <em>(the best of) New Order</em> adds in songs from their two-post <em>Substance</em> albums and their UK #1 single "World in Motion", but also contained remixes and new re-recordings of some of their songs in place of the popular versions (in fact only "Thieves Like Us" appears in the same version as on <em>Substance</em>). 2002's <em>International</em> adds in songs from the one album the band made post-<em>Best Of</em>, but it was only released in a few countries. 2005's <em>Singles</em> contains all of the band's 7" single A-sides (which were either more or less popular than the 12" versions, depending on the single). Lastly, 2011's <em>Total</em> contains the most popular songs from both New Order and its predecessor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoyDivision">Joy Division</a>, but the record was only begrudgingly put together by the then-newly reunited band because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">their record label wanted to cash in</a> on the aforementioned reunion and as such, it isn't well liked by the band's fans.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sloan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sloan">Sloan</a>:<em>A Sides Win: Singles 19922005</em> which consisted of 14 already released singles plus 2 new ones.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteveTaylor">Steve Taylor</a> released two such albums. As is generally the case, the latter of the two (titled <em>Now The Truth Can Be Told</em>) is preferred, since it contains his hits from later in his career.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaintEtienne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaintEtienne">Saint Etienne</a> have put out about half a dozen, with so many mixed up and crossed over tracklists it can be difficult to work out which is which, and which isn't an actual new album, and which ones were only released in certain areas, and... The main ones are probably <em>Too Young To Die</em>, <em>Smash The System</em> and <em>London Conversations</em>, but there's also <em>You Need A Mess Of Help To Stand Alone</em>, <em>Fairy Tales</em> (Japan only), <em>Travel Edition</em> (US only), <em>Boxette</em> (a box set, natch), and several remix albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BlackSabbath">Black Sabbath</a> have had several, many of them with nearly-identical tracklists. Most compilations cover the Ozzy era, from 1970-78, with <em>The Dio Years</em> covering the Dio era, with three new songs recorded specifically for the compilation. The super-obscure <em>Sabbath Stones</em> covers the Ian Gillan, and Tony Martin era, but it wasn't released in North America. No tracks from <em>The Seventh Star</em> are on any Sabbath compilations, because it was a de facto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">Tony Iommi solo project</a> and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">only labeled a Black Sabbath album because the record label insisted upon it.</a>
<ul><li> After Ozzy became a TV star and the band's profile was raised the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits">Greatest Hits</a> starting coming out every other year before switching to an annual schedule. In 2002 they released <em>Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 19701978</em>, a two-disc set that was the first band sanctioned release of the Ozzy era. It was notable for having brand new remasters, which came from the sessions that resulted in <em>The Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath (19701978)</em>, a box set of all eight albums released two years later. And two years after <em>that</em> came <em>Greatest Hits 19701978</em>, which is essentially the two-disc set condensed down into one disc. Then three years later they released <em>Greatest Hits,</em> which was almost identical to the previous collection. And finally, in 2012 they released <em>Iron Man: The Best of Black Sabbath</em> which <em>is</em> identical to the previous collection. And thats just the Ozzy era. In 2007 there was a one-disc <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatestHits">Greatest Hits</a> collecting Dio era tunes and in 2008 there was a boxset containing all four albums. Between 2002 and 2009 there was a compilation released every year save for 2003 and 2005.
</li></ul></li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doujinshi">doujinshi</a> musicians can get into this too, if they are successful enough. Alstroemeria Records, well known for its remixes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> soundtrack, released <em>EXSERENS</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">(sic)</a> which contains some of their most iconic remixes. This includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Bad Apple</a>.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CalvinAndHobbesTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CalvinAndHobbesTheSeries">Calvin and Hobbes: The Series</a></em> when a partying monster puts on "Best of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise">Little Kids Screaming</a>".
</li><li> Surprisingly for a long-running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHitWonder">No-Hit Wonder</a>, The Melvins sort of have two "best of" albums. The first was <em>Melvinmania</em>, which was only released in the UK, focused entirely on their three Atlantic Records albums, and was compiled without the band's involvement - the timing of it's release was most likely an attempt by their former label to cash in on a then-recent UK tour. The second was a band-picked best-of that was basically an extra to their 229 page retrospective book <em>Neither Here Nor There</em>, and wasn't officially available on it's own.

</li><li> After their breakup, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a> released the compilation <em>A-Sides</em>: Despite the title, it didn't quite have <em>every</em> song they released as a single, and also featured a few songs that weren't originally a-sides - "Nothing to Say" and "Bleed Together" were both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BSide">B Sides</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0d5iv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0d5iv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0d5iv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> though "Bleed Together" was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RereleaseTheSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RereleaseTheSong">re-released as it's own single to promote the album</a></span>, while "Get On The Snake" was on <em>Louder Than Love</em> but was never released as a single. A second best of, called <em>Telephantasm</em>, came thirteen years later, in tandem with the band's reunion: It was notable for coming in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanillaEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanillaEdition">Vanilla Edition</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition">Limited Special Collector's Ultimate Edition</a> flavors, and for the fact that copies of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanillaEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanillaEdition">Vanilla Edition</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1a86t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1a86t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1a86t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Actually, it was slightly <em>more</em> vanilla than the retail vanilla addition - it was packaged in a white paper sleeve without any artwork</span> were included with purchase of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a>: Warriors Of Rock</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cascada">Cascada</a> have released three best of albums over the course of three years. Due to their lack of singles, the same ten tracks have been included on all three. Although this is somewhat justified as the second disc of <em>Original Me</em> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">exclusive to the UK</a>. However, both <em>Back On The Dancefloor</em> and <em>The Best Of Cascada</em> were exclusive to Germany, despite having near identical tracklisting (even the order of tracks is suspiciously similar).
</li><li> For a rare non-musical example, there was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Strong Bad Email</a> compilation "Sbemails' 50 Greatest Hits", which contained both well-known emails like "dragon" and "fan club", and other assorted hidden gems, including 5 bonus emails (not new ones, but already existing emails added as bonuses). It was made to resemble an infomercial mocking less popular sbemails; among other things, it claimed to cut through "caked on tape-leg". The DVD is no longer purchasable, which is unfortunate, as it was the only way to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">creators' commentary</a> for certain emails.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OzzyOsbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> has had a few. The first two, <em>Best of Ozz</em> and <em>Ten Commandments</em>, were released at the initiative of the record company in 1989 and 1990. In 1997 Ozzy released his first proper compilation, <em>The Ozzman Cometh</em>, which is a career retrospective with a few live cuts, unreleased songs and demos mixed in. After he became a reality TV star Sony released <em>The Essential Ozzy Osbourne</em> as part of their <em>The Essential</em> line, which covered the hits <em>Cometh</em> missed. After this a boxset was released and Ozzy, sick of having so many compilations pushed out in such a short time, mostly filled it with live tracks and rarities.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a> had a career spanning several decades and numerous greatest-hits compilations. These include the themed collection (with songs chosen by Johnny himself) <em>Love</em>, <em>Murder</em>, and <em>God</em>. Johnny also had a 1963 album <em>Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash</em>, which wasn't a proper greatest hits album. It was a collection of singles and EP tracks which <em>hadn't</em> appeared on any albums before. The best known compilations are a pair from the 2000s: 2002's triple-platinum two-disc <em>The Essential Johnny Cash</em> and 2005's double-platinum one-disc career overview <em>The Legend of Johnny Cash</em>.

The band themselves later released their own, <em>A Best of Us From the Rest of Us</em>, that even comes complete with acoustic versions of every song that appears on it.
</li><li> Barenaked Ladies parodied this concept on their <em>first album</em> with the song "Box Set", which is about a band explaining that they're releasing a six-disc box set, only one of which contains any music worth listening to, and if you're a fan of the band you already have everything on it.
<ul><li> Then in 2001, a lyric from this song provided the title for <em>All Their Greatest Hits</em>, their first such compilation. Confusingly, "Box Set" was not actually included on this disc. (To be fair, the song itself was never a hit, or even a single.)

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicImageLtd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicImageLtd">Public Image Ltd.</a>'s <em>The Greatest Hits, So Far</em>, which covered their recordings from 1978 to 1990 - this amounts to most of their albums because, while they continued recording <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmTheBand">in some form or other</a>, their output slowed down a lot after 1990. Notable for including the newly recorded song "Don't Ask Me" and a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNotRemix">The Not-Remix</a> version of "Rise".
<ul><li> Somewhat related is <em>The Best of British £1 Notes</em>, a 2005 compilation that functioned as a "Best Of" album for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLydon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLydon">John Lydon</a>: Most of the album focuses on PiL material because that's the project he's been involved with the longest, but it also includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SexPistols">Sex Pistols</a> songs, as well as solo material and two guest appearances with other artists. This time the one new track was a new Lydon solo recording called "Rabbit Song", taken from an in-progress album that apparently never got off the ground. There was also a two disc version, which added a few more PiL songs and remixes.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnsonTheCompleteRecordings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnsonTheCompleteRecordings">The Complete Recordings</a></em> is a 1990 compilation album with music by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RobertJohnson">Robert Johnson</a>, posthumously released and well regarded as one of the most essential musical recordings ever.
</li><li> As a certified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runner</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> has done several over their 45+ year history:
<ul><li> <em>Sing the Hit Songs of Sesame Street</em> (1974) was the earliest greatest hits album in the show's extensive discography.
</li><li> <em>25 Greatest Hits</em> (1975) was issued by K-Tel (you know, the company that did the <em>Solid Gold</em> album series and all those other various artists compilations), who was the first outside label to release a <em>Sesame</em> compilation.
</li><li> <em>60 Favorite Songs from Sesame Street</em> (1975) spans 5 LP's and mostly covers songs from the show's previous backlog of released material, but also contains some exclusive and never-released-again cuts (for example the TV version of "What's the Name Of That Song?")
</li><li> Subverted with <em>Sesame Street Gold!</em> (1977), which is just a straight reissue of the show's first two albums<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3xd8u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3xd8u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3xd8u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>The Sesame Street Book &amp; Record</em> (1970) and <em>The Official Sesame Street 2 Book-and-Record Album</em> (1971)</span> in a single package, though both albums spawned some of the show's most classic songs.
</li><li> <em>Muppet Masquerade</em> (1978) added an interesting twist to the "greatest hits" concept: it contained 3 LP's with one side each of a certain character's songs (Bert and Ernie shared one side) along with cardboard masks of the characters whose songs were featured, encouraging young listeners to "Be a Muppet!"
</li><li> <em>Sesame Street Treasury</em> (1980)
</li><li> In 1983, Bert, Big Bird, the Count, Cookie Monster, Ernie, Oscar and Grover all got "The Best Of..." compilations to themselves. Multiple reissues and similar compilations (e.g. <em>"C" Is for Cookie: Cookie's Favorite Songs</em> from 1995) would follow over the years.
</li><li> <em>The Best of Sesame Street</em> (1987) was the first CD made of the show, and the only such CD made in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>.
</li><li> <em>Jim Henson: A Sesame Street Celebration</em> (1991) is an oddly specific greatest hits album, as it was more of a tribute to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson">Jim Henson</a> after he died. Of the 21 tracks (nine of which were released for the first time), the first half is primarily focused on Ernie, the second primarily on Kermit (both were Jim's most well-known <em>Sesame</em> characters), and a few tracks by some other Jim characters appear occasionally.
</li><li> Ditto for <em>Sing: Songs of Joe Raposo</em> (1992), which was released three years after the prolific <em>Street</em> composer's death from cancer. In addition to the obligatory Muppet-focused tracks, Raposo himself sung on a few others, and there were also guest appearances from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayCharles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RayCharles">Ray Charles</a>, Patti LaBelle, Gladys Knight, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Carpenters">Carpenters</a> (whose version of "Sing", as featured here, was first released on their 1973 album <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NowAndThen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NowAndThen">Now And Then</a></em> and became a chart hit from there).
</li><li> <em>Sesame Street Celebrates!</em> (1994) marked the show's 25th anniversary with some classic cuts plus eight previously unreleased songs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SesameStreetPlatinumAllTimeFavorites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SesameStreetPlatinumAllTimeFavorites">Platinum All-Time Favorites</a></em> (1995) actually made it into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalRecordingRegistry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalRecordingRegistry">National Recording Registry</a> 20 years after its release. A follow-up album, <em>Platinum Too</em>, was released in 1997.
</li><li> <em>Sesame Street Best</em> (1997)
</li><li> <em>Songs from the Street: 35 Years of Music</em> (2003): Like <em>Sesame Street Celebrates!</em>, <em>Songs from the Street</em> marked the 35th anniversary of the show with some timeless classics and exclusive cuts, including a brand-new (at the time) remix of the classic theme by Ursula 1000. It takes up three discs containing 63 tracks, 25 of which were unreleased.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SidSings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SidSings">Sid Sings</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SidVicious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SidVicious">Sid Vicious</a> is a combination of this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverAlbum">Cover Album</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiveAlbum">Live Album</a>. It was released after Sid's early death and was nothing more than a cobbled together collection of badly produced and sang tracks. But it's the only album ever made around his name and in that regard it's as close to a greatest hits album by him you can find.
</li><li> After the band officially broke up in 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MyChemicalRomance">My Chemical Romance</a> released a greatest hits album in 2014 titled <em>May Death Never Stop You</em>, which included songs from all of the band's commercially released albums, along with one previously unreleased song and demos from the rare demo tape "Dreams of Stabbing and/or Being Stabbed."
</li><li> Popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuMetal">Nu Metal</a> band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Korn">Korn</a> has released two greatest hits albums. First in 2004 the band released one titled <em>Greatest Hits, Vol. 1</em> which compiled together select songs from all of the band's albums released up to that point, along with a remix of "Freak on a Leash" and two covers (one of Cameo's "Word Up" and another of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "Another Brick in the Wall"). A "Vol. 2" has yet to be released, as instead the band put out <em>The Essential Korn</em> in 2011 which stuck solely to songs off of the band's output from 1994-2003 (including more songs off those albums, and re-including the covers previously on the other greatest hits album). A possible reasoning for the omissions of songs past 2004 could be due to how fans tend to regard the albums released between <em>Take a Look in the Mirror</em> and <em>Korn III</em> as the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a>, and <em>Korn III</em>, the band's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WinBackTheCrowd">Win Back the Crowd</a> album, was still a fresh release at the time.
</li><li> <em>ICON: A Very Special Christmas</em> is one for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AVerySpecialChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AVerySpecialChristmas">A Very Special Christmas</a></em> series of albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a> have a lot of those, as early as 1966 by combining their singles in <em>Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass)</em>. <em>Hot Rocks 19641971</em> (1971) is their best-selling album in the United States, being certified for 12 million copies. The most comprehensive were made as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">Milestone Celebrations</a>. The 40th anniversary earned <em>Forty Licks</em>, a two disk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">40 track</a> album with 36 hits and 4 new songs. The 50th in turn inspired <em>GRRR!</em>, a three disk, 50 song album with only 2 new tracks (that also got a budget version with 2 disks and 40 tracks - most shared with <em>Forty Licks</em>, including one of the new songs - and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedSpecialCollectorsUltimateEdition">deluxe edition with 4 disks, 80 songs, plus a bonus CD, bonus LP, and a few collectibles</a>). The most recent one is "Honk!", collecting the best songs starting from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StickyFingers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StickyFingers">Sticky Fingers</a> and going up until Blue &amp; Lonesome, the most recent one. It's available in the form of 1 CD, 2 Vinyl Records, and a deluxe 3 CD edition adding in other songs and live tracks
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PoetsOfTheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PoetsOfTheFall">Poets of the Fall</a> has <em>Best of Poets of the Fall,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">only</a> released in India for some reason, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> entry with <em>Alchemy Vol. 1</em>, as its actually a collection of the bands favorites and two new songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy">Fall Out Boy</a> has two. <em> Believers Never Die: Greatest Hits</em> is their more "official" one being considered part of their discography, and includes most (if not all) of their singles and popular songs pre-<em>Save Rock And Roll</em>, along with their cover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>'s "Beat It". The second is from the ICON series of budget greatest hits albums and just has the singles from second through fourth albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Primus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Primus">Primus</a>'s <em>They Can't All Be Zingers</em>, featuring one to three songs each from their first six albums (plus one from the EP included with the <em>Animals Should Not Try To Act Like People</em> DVD). It can be considered more of a "best of" than a "greatest hits" due to including some album tracks and omitting a couple of official singles. The two missing singles in question are "Lacquer Head" and "Electric Uncle Sam" from <em>Antipop</em>, omitted in favor of "Coattails Of A Dead Man", that album's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomWaits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomWaits">Tom Waits</a> collaboration. This is probably because <em>Antipop</em> had a mixed critical reception and the band themselves weren't entirely happy with it, but Les Claypool has mentioned liking "Coattails Of A Dead Man".
</li><li> Parodied in <em>Pachelbel's Greatest Hit</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitWonder">note the lack of an "s"</a>), an album containing fifteen different arrangements and adaptations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PachelbelsCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PachelbelsCanon">Pachelbel's Canon</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Asia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Asia">Asia</a>'s <em>Then &amp; Now</em>, released in 1990, was half of a Greatest Hits album and half a studio album full of new songs. Their compilation album <em>Anthology</em>, released in the 1990s, tried to combine the best of the John Wetton lineup songs with the best of the John Payne lineup songs by presenting them in their original versions, but when Wetton's estate refused to allow his versions of the songs to be used in that fashion, John Payne simply did cover versions of the John Wetton lineup songs instead. <em>Anthologia</em>, which covered the entirety of the John Wetton lineup of songs, would be later re-released as <em>Asia: Gold</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a> has released four greatest hits albums:
<ul><li> <em>Discography: The Complete Singles Collection</em>, which comprised all of their UK Top 20 hit singles at the time (minus "How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously?", even though it was released as an A-side single with "Where the Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes off You)", which did appear on the album) and two new songs "DJ Culture" and "Was It Worth It?"
</li><li> <em>PopArt: The Hits</em> was more or less an extension of <em>Discography</em> as it also comprised of their post-<em>Behaviour</em> UK Top 20 singles (minus "Absolutely Fabulous", which did despite being a Top 20 hit didn't appear due to licencing reasons since it featured sound bites from the popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous">BBC sitcom of the same name</a>, "Break 4 Love", which was only released as a US only single and "London", which was released as a single in Germany only) in addition to all singles from its predecessor (minus "Was It Worth It?", which was their only single at the time not to be a UK Top 20 hit) and two new songs "Miracles" and "Flamboyant".
</li><li> <em>Party</em>, which was released in Brazil only to promote the group's Brazilian leg of their 2009-10 Pandemonium tour and included 15 selected singles from their ten albums at the time along with "King of Rome", a song from their tenth album <em>Yes</em> that was never released as a single.
</li><li> <em>Ultimate</em>, which was a single disc retrospective album marking the 25th anniversary of their debut single "West End Girls" and comprising of 18 selected singles from their discography, newly remastered in addition to one new song "Together".
</li></ul></li><li> Most complication albums of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimmieRodgers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimmieRodgers">Jimmie Rodgers</a>' recordings are more or less one since all of the recordings he did in his lifetime consisted of an individual song.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Westlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Westlife">Westlife</a> have two:
<ul><li> <em>Unbreakable  The Greatest Hits Volume 1</em>, which comprised of all of their UK Top 20 hits released at the time with six new songs. The Asian and Spanish versions include a bilingual duet of their song "Flying Without Wings" aa the twentieth track, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoAKorea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BoAKorea">BoA</a> for the former and Cristian Castro for the latter, along with the Asian version having the US mix of "A World of Our Own" instead of the original version and replaces "What Makes a Man" with their non-UK and Ireland single "I Lay My Love on You".

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieGoesToHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankieGoesToHollywood">Frankie Goes to Hollywood</a> have a few. <em>Bang!... The Greatest Hits Of Frankie Goes To Hollywood</em> (1993) composes of all the singles with a few album tracks mixed in (it was promoted with a successful re-release of "Relax", which backfired due to said compilation including a unreleased alternative mix). <em>Maximum Joy</em> (2000) does the same but with the album versions, with a disc composing of new trance remixes. <em>Frankie Says Greatest</em> (2009) was released with big-name company Universal Music, and has a heavy focus on the hits (one version includes a extra disc with 12" mixes and rare tracks, and another is a 2LP set with a lot of remixes). <em>Frankie Said</em> (2012) is a "Compact Introduction" to the group, with a mix of album tracks and rare mixes. <em>The Best Of</em> (2013) is budget-oriented, with a regular "Frankie's best" tracklisting on disc 1 and a few 12" mixes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note430jq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note430jq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note430jq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Relax (Sex Mix), The Power Of Love (12" version), Two Tribes (Annihilation), Welcome to The Pleasuredome (How To Remake The World) and Rage Hard (+++*/Compacted)</span> on Disc 2. <em>Simply</em> (2015) is another budget-oriented compilation, focusing on content from the Salvo-era FGTH releases.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink">P!nk</a> released an album entitled "Greatest Hits... So Far!!!!".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GeorgeMichael">George Michael</a> had two greatest hits albums:
<ul><li> <em>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen: The Best of George Michael</em>, which was a double album comprising all of his hit singles at the time along with three new songs and one cover version that was released on <em>Red Hot + Rio</em> with notable differences of the second disc as in the American and Japanese versions, "The Strangest Thing '97" and "Fantasy" (a B-side from "Waiting for That Day" with a reworked version appearing on the album) are replaced by "Monkey" and "Hard Day", while in the former, "As" was excluded altogether, while "Waltz Away Dreaming" was exclusive to the cassette and MiniDisc versions.
</li><li> <em>Twenty Five</em> is an expanded version of the original, comprising of many songs that were included in the original though with notable exceptions in addition to four hits from his career in Wham! and two new songs and a reworking of "Heal the Pain" along with a limited edition including a third disc comprising of non-single album tracks and one new song. It also marked the first North American release from his discography to include "As" and "Shoot the Dog", both of which were excluded from their respective albums for said territory due to the former being excluded after Michael's arrest for engaging in a lewd act and the latter being excluded for its anti-war content.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoxyMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RoxyMusic">Roxy Music</a> has more than a few compilations of this nature, several of which are actually a mix of their songs and Bryan Ferry solo numbers. Two of the more successful compilations were released in the span of 3 years — 1986's <em>Street Life: 20 Great Hits</em>, weighted more to Roxy Music numbers, and 1988's <em>The Ultimate Collection</em>, which featured primarily Ferry songs. The latter also featured two new-to-U.K.-listeners songs: a Ferry cover of "He'll Have to Go" and the U.S.-only single "Help Me" (the song originally intended for the end credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFly1986">The Fly (1986)</a></em> — and notable for <em>not</em> appearing on that soundtrack album after being demoted to background music in one scene).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a> have had many of these over the years:
<ul><li> The three <em>Best of the Beach Boys</em> volumes of the late 1960s were released by Capitol in response to their decreasing commercial success: <em>Vol. 1</em> came out a few months after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetSounds">Pet Sounds</a></em> was released to lower sales than expected, <em>Vol. 2</em> was hastily assembled after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Smile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Smile">Smile</a></em> was shelved, and <em>Vol. 3</em> was made to compensate for the poor sales of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Friends">Friends</a></em>.
</li><li> The 1974 double-LP compilation <em>Endless Summer</em>, covering the 1962-65 period, proved a mixed blessing to the group, as while it revived their popularity, it also accelerated their descent from "innovative band" to "oldies act". A followup, <em>Spirit of America</em>, came out the next year and covered the same era, but since the predecessor already included most of their hits, Capitol had to pull out a bunch of deep cuts to pad out the two discs.
</li><li> A 2003 compilation, <em>Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of the Beach Boys</em>, proved very popular for a compilation, charting at #16 in the U.S. and receiving double platinum certification. A "companion" volume was released in 2007, <em>The Warmth of the Sun</em>, which included fan favorites left out of <em>Sounds of Summer</em>.
</li><li> For the more hardcore fans, there was the 1993 <em>Good Vibrations: Thrity Years of the Beach Boys</em> boxset, which included a mix of hits, rarities, outtakes and live versions over five discs. A successor, <em>Made in California</em>, came out in 2013 and included its own unique rarities and outtakes among the expected hits, leading to some grumbling from fans about having to rebuy the same old songs again just to get the new stuff.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Madonna">Madonna</a> has released four:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheImmaculateCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheImmaculateCollection">The Immaculate Collection</a></em> which comprises of fifteen hit singles from her first decade in music and were remixed with QSound technology and two new singles "Justify My Love" and "Rescue Me".
</li><li> <em>Something to Remember</em> which was more of a ballad compilation album than a greatest hits album, given the fact that it comprises of five songs she recorded for films and soundtracks including two that were never included in any of her albums prior to this along with three new songs, four previously-released singles, a remix of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoverVersion">Cover Version</a> of Rose Royce's "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" and an orchestral version of one of the new songs.
</li><li> <em>GHV2</em>, which comprises of fiteen hit singles from her second decade in music though no new material, due to the fact she was busy shooting the remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SweptAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SweptAway">Swept Away</a></em> at the time. Interestingly enough, it originated as a companion album for her 1999 music video compilation <em>The Video Collection 93:99</em> and was going to come out in the same year to tie in with her then-upcoming world tour but it was scrapped due to her shooting <em>The Next Best Thing</em> as well as her pregnancy that resulted in the tour to be postponed to 2001.
</li><li> <em>Celebration</em>, which marked her last release with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBrosRecords">Warner (Bros.) Records</a>'' and true to its name, is a retrospective comprising of hits from her time at the label as well as including three new songs.
