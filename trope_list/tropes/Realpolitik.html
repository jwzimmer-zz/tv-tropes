</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This trope is prevalent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em>, with the colossal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileUp">Gambit Pile Up</a>. Nick Fury's goal of protecting humanity, for instance, is noble and he's unquestionably on the side of the good guys, he's willing to use some very shady means to bring it about, with much of the story being a chess match between him and Lucius Malfoy. And that is but the tip of the iceberg.
<ul><li> Fury's protégé, Director Peter Wisdom of MI13, is an even worse offender, having almost none of his teacher's scruples and being a textbook example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfettered">The Unfettered</a>. He takes advantage of Parliament's fears over the current global situation in order to amass resources and power at a rate that frightens the rest of British Intelligence, uses blackmail and bribery to secure the aid of superpowered individuals, and is working to control, or outright supplant altogether, the currently crippled Ministry of Magic as Britain's magic response organisation. He explains that he genuinely does love his country, and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">quite simply, there is nothing he will not do to preserve it.</a>
</li><li> Doctor Strange, meanwhile, plays both of the above, and just about everyone else like a harp, even when they <em>know</em> he's manipulating them. How? Two reasons. First, they know that he never lies. This is not the same as being honest, but it's an important baseline. Second, the consequences of <em>not</em> doing what he advises are usually a great deal worse, because he is working for the preservation of humanity. This means that everyone winds up, reluctantly, marching to Strange's fife.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EventHorizonStormOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EventHorizonStormOfMagic">Event Horizon: Storm of Magic</a></em>, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">The Company's</a> M.O. through and through, often resorting to underhanded tactics to get what they want.

</li><li> The newborn Kingdom of Summer allowing the Faith to establish septs in their territories with tax exemptions and the right to raise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">their own soldiers</a> (albeit on a limited basis). All done to provide further aid to their new subjects, as well as a way of drawing more men from Westeros in a way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">gets around</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> King Stannis'</span> prohibition on the Dragonhunt recruiting new forces.

<ul><li> Despite finding the people of Troyius repulsive, the Klingons still provide them with military and technological aid to counter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">TeTO's</a> alliance with the neighboring world of Elas, as this gives them a foothold in the system.
</li><li> The Quarians' reconciliation with the Geth is purely to give them better standing against the Five Galaxies.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup">crowning herself</a> Empress, Daena T'Drak has the new Asari Empire join the Pact of the Raptor alongside their old enemies the Romulans, noting that it's the best way to restore their species' prestige.</span>
</li><li> When Blackfire breaks her alliance with the Romulans and brings Tamaran into TeTO, TeTO looks the other way regarding the Romulan-backed coup which brought her into power in the first place due to preparing for the Reaper War and not having the time or resources to waste on removing her from power. After the war, they begrudgingly let her stay on as Queen (albeit with a transition to constitutional monarchy instead of absolute monarchy) since any other course of action would trigger a civil war which TeTO would get bogged down in.
</li><li> During the Revenant Crisis, when TeTO is aiding the Ildrian Empire in fighting the rouge Decepticons and Klikiss robots, the Pact of the Raptor also gets involved. Officially, this is due to viewing the machines as a mutual threat to all organic life, like the Reapers before them. In truth, however, they're trying to win the Ildrians over towards the idea of joining them instead of TeTO, thus increasing their bloc's power and resources.
</li><li> When Rimillia is discovered, Captain Georgiou offers to bring them into TeTO to help them terraform their hostile ecosystem and develop their primitive FTL technology to expand out of their system. In exchange, she admits, TeTO would get access to Rimillia's rich mineral resources and strategic location.
</li><li> The Shield Alliance doesn't hesitate to take advantage of the genetic disorder plaguing the Valakians, playing up their own knowledge of genetic engineering as a cure and ignoring the potential dangers of it, to convince them to join their bloc instead of TeTO.
</li><li> The Pact of the Raptor spreads propaganda of the Harvesters' and Vinn's past ways in order to besmirch the Shield Alliance's reputation and convince the Deltan Union to join them instead (they try to do the same to TeTO, but they have fewer skeletons in their closets).
</li><li> The Romulans back the Duras rebels in the Praxis War, as they're more friendly to the Pact of the Raptor than the TeTO-aligned Azetbur government.
</li><li> During the second Klingon civil war, TeTO can't directly intervene for political legal reasons, but still unofficially supply Azetbur's forces via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower">Conspiracy of Light</a> (who are technically neutral), as the potential threat of reactionary forces regaining control of the Empire is too great to ignore.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the central pillars of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OfSheepAndBattleChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OfSheepAndBattleChicken">Of Sheep and Battle Chicken</a></em> is this trope.

As Dresden notes, there's enough decency in him that, to Dresden's irritation, he can't just file him under pure villain and call it a day. However, this relative decency, tight control of Chicago's underworld, and considerable resultant power mean that Dresden winds up saving him on several occasions, and helping him expand his power by becoming an Accorded Baron under the Unseelie Accords, simply because he is far better than the alternative and, in the latter case, Dresden can't be everywhere and Marcone will defend Chicago out of pure pragmatism (it's <em>his</em> turf) if given the opportunity.

Chekov notes that part of the reason Russia is willing to take a backseat to America is because that way, the United States foots most of the bill for adapting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum">Imported Alien Phlebotinum</a>, then Russia can turn around and build from American blueprints for a fraction of the cost.
<ul><li> In "Crusade", when the Russian Federation briefly supports the People's Republic of China bid for control of the Stargate, Chekov later admits that it was simply a ploy by his government to leverage plans to build their own <em>Daedalus-class</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">battlecruiser</a>.

<ul><li> Robb Stark is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">great at battle tactics</a>, but when it comes to politics he made two MAJOR political mistakes that would eventually cost him dearly, all because he refused to play Realpolitik.
</li><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, Tywin Lannister, is the embodiment of Realpolitik and it is extended to the rest of his family, whether they like it or not. To wit, the continued success of the Lannisters  beyond military might, and the sheer amount of gold the family rests upon  is due largely to Tywin's cold, critical knack for impersonal politicking.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Lord Tywin:</strong> The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
</div><ul><li> He forges an alliance with the rival Tyrell family (via Littlefinger), the second most powerful family in Westeros, by marrying his grandsons to them and they help him crush Stannis Baratheon. He offers his enemy house member Roose Bolton (Robb Stark's second-in-command) the title of Warden of the North, and Walder Frey (a potential Stark supporter) the lord paramount title of the Riverlands. Robb Stark is murdered by these two soon after. He'd also (as much as he'd prefer not to) sell out his own attack dog Ser Gregor Clegane to the Martells if it means solidifying the Lannister power base.
</li><li> He further explains this reasoning to Cersei after winning the war, noting that there's only so much the Lannisters can bully and push people around and the space for that is even less when they are broke and in debt. So Tywin has to curry favor with the Tyrells with marriage alliances even if he doesn't trust them at all:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Tywin:</strong> You don't form alliances with people you trust.
</div><ul><li> On the other hand, while brilliant in politics, Tywin's less pragmatic attitude towards his family and personal affairs is ultimately what leads to his downfall. Interestingly enough, his second term as Hand of the King follows a similar trajectory to Ned Stark's tenure. Even though he's a ruthless and feared administrator with almost no lengths to which he won't go to secure his family's power, he still fails to prevent an assassination of the king, is made into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a> by Littlefinger, agitates an old enemy who has one of his family in their power to the point of conflict, and dies.
</li></ul></li><li> Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish gives several speeches embodying this perspective. He also practices it, creating alliances between the Tyrells(who had supported a rival claimant Renly Baratheon) and the Lannisters and managing to negotiate for himself a sweet position as Lord of the only region in Westeros that hasn't participated in the war. He gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">"World of Cardboard" Speech</a> to this effect, noting that the Kingdom, the traditions of honor and chivalry, even the Iron Throne are essentially fictitious constructs that embodies the values of order rather than enforces it and the realm actually functions on an elaborate deception.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Littlefinger</strong>: The realm. Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies, a story we agree to tell each other over and over, until we forget that it's a lie. <br/><strong>Lord Varys</strong>: But what do we have left, once we abandon the lie? Chaos? A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all. <br/><strong>Littlefinger</strong> Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them. And some, are given a chance to climb. They refuse, they cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>, this way of reasoning is often used by Clayton Webb and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CIA">CIA</a> characters to justify their actions.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOrville">The Orville</a></em> uses this at times to show how a Planety Union may have issues with some of its own members.
<ul><li> The biggest case are the Moclans. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a>, they provide much of the technology the Union needs and some members are good people. However, their "traditions" can often seem very backward. If a Moclan is born pure female, they must either undergo a gender correction surgery or be forever exiled from their society. Likewise, a Moclan attracted to a female of another species also faces being ostracized. "Deflectors" has Ed and Kelly openly musing on how the Moclan society clashes far too much with the rest of the Union but the brutal truth is, the Union needs them too much to try and make them conform.
<ul><li> The solution to this crisis was realizing that this trope cuts two ways. Sure, the Moclans have some of the best weapons tech in the Union, but they don't have the manpower when faced with the recent threat of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Kaylon</span> and the only other possible alliance that could cover that disadvantage would be the Krill, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a> who believe any non-Krill offend their god by simply existing. Sure, the Krill formed an alliance of convenience in the last threat, but they still weren't making any attempt at a cease-fire let alone a defense alliance. As Captain Mercer points out if the Moclans want to leave the Union to ensure they stay a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleSexSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleSexSpecies">Single-Sex Species</a>, they can do that... but the all Female colony is better hidden and will likely survive it's not exactly what the males want from the negotiation.
</li><li> Ultimately the agreement reached is that the Female Moclans will stop the underground railroad to liberate females born on Moclus and aren't admitted as full members of the Union, in exchange, Moclus will not try to eliminate the colony. As the female's leader points out, the solution is not ideal, but considering that it's a step up from genocide in that they get to live to fight another day, it's certainly a major victory from their view.

Nathanson spins a story about how Palmer's death was a necessity, but Jack's not buying it.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> this is the basic approach the Imperium of Man takes in regards to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">T'au Empire</a> and vice versa. For example, in the wake of the Damocles Crusade, many Imperial worlds were stripped of their defenders in order to make a stand at Macragge against the tyranids of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Hive Fleet Behemoth</a>. The T'au expanded their empire in the wake of the Imperial muster, going into now-defenseless systems and offering to protect them in exchange for annexation rights. Those who would not accept the deal were simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomped</a> as most of their defenses were already removed. The T'au defend their aggressive actions by saying that if they had not "expanded defensive interests" to those Imperial worlds, then other, less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAlienInvasion">benevolent</a> powers would have taken them anyway before the Imperium could build its forces back up to keep them. <br/><br/>On the other side, while the Imperium of course wants to be rid of the T'au eventually, they generally refrain from taking direct offensive action against them, except to try and liberate Imperial worlds that the T'au have annexed, preferring instead a policy of trying to contain the T'au Empire's expansion. This is in part because of the huge drain of military resources that would be required to completely rout the T'au, but it is also because the T'au Empire functions as a bulwark against Tyranid hive fleets, Orks, and other local powers around the Eastern Fringe where the Imperium's power is limited. As long as the T'au Empire exists, it will distract other potential threats away from Imperial worlds, and the Imperium is only too happy to let that happen. On the flip side, both nations are more than willing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">cooperate in the face of major regional threats</a>, such as when Hive Fleet Kraken invaded in 992.M41.
</li><li> The trope name would be an entirely legitimate alternate title for the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft">Spycraft</a></em> D20 system. While not necessarily a spy in the literal sense, every player is an agent, tasked with achieving an objective with few restrictions on methods and many restrictions on exposure.
<ul><li> All major forms of diplomacy, negotiation, and some forms of combat can be replaced by a large wallet and a highly-developed "bribe" mechanic.
</li><li> Combat is intentionally designed to favor people that play dirty, set up traps, and hit weak points. Unlike other d20 games, it's almost unheard of for combat to move past 5 or 6 rounds— someone will have found a weak point and exploited an instant-kill long before then. You also mostly use combat to remove troublesome civilians and diplomats, so that you can replace them in a disguise.
</li></ul></li><li> The tabletop game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Diplomacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Diplomacy">Diplomacy</a></em> runs on this. The whole idea is to keep <em>your</em> nation intact or on top and to hell with everyone else. If that involves saying you'll ally with another player and stabbing them in the back to side with their more powerful enemy three turns later, so be it.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> setting for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> downplays the realpolitik elements of the setting in the core book but still plants the seeds for any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> who wants to use them, mostly to subvert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">Character Alignment</a> tropes in the rulers of the various nations, who just got out of a long and bloody war with one another:
<ul><li> The nation of Breland is probably least interested in it - King Boranel is an old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> adventurer at heart - and can get away with it thanks to the riches of Xen'drik that funnel through their land, but the laid-back attitude and fantastic wealth leave the nation rife with corruption and plagued by political factions lead by people who do not shy away from realpolitik.
</li><li> On the other end of the spectrum you have Aundair, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a> Queen Aurala is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighQueen">The High Queen</a> for her own people, but is working hardest behind the scenes to prepare for and get a jump on everyone else for the next big war she sees on the horizon, <em>because</em> it would be best for her people to be ready. But also because she thinks it would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnlightenedSelfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnlightenedSelfInterest">best for everyone if she really did lead them all</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> runs off this trope.

<ul><li> You can easily fall into this way of thinking in games developed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive">Paradox Interactive</a>, most all of which have you play as a single nation through a turbulent part of history.
<ul><li> This is especially the case when playing multiplayer with real people, since wars in Paradox's games tend to heavily favour those who mobilize their troops first. And due to the excessive costs of having your troops at full maintenance during peacetime you'll find most people having minimal maintenance during peacetime. Thus he who mobilizes and attacks first gets the upper hand, by gaining several victories before the opposing side gets to a comparable level of mobilization. Due to this multiplayer games often devolve into people legitimizing their declarations of war by saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoUntoOthersBeforeTheyDoUntoUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoUntoOthersBeforeTheyDoUntoUs">"We're only attacking you so as not to have our nation wiped out in case you decided to attack us..."</a>

Once the US is defeated, the CSA-AUS alliance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">immediately falls apart</a>.
</li><li> The example right above applies to any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourX">4X</a> and Grand Strategy games, regardless of settings or degree of realism. Why would you ally with a power that decimated your people or offends your sensibilities? Because there are bigger, nastier powers out there gunning on both of you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, most of the major galactic powers engage in this, especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoOmniscientCouncilOfBickering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoOmniscientCouncilOfBickering">Citadel Council</a>.

This is also the reason why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Asari refused to share their intact Prothean Beacon with the rest of the galaxy, despite writing the laws that made sharing Beacon knowledge mandatory for all other races, as data-mining it was the only way they maintained their position as the dominant race in the galaxy</span>.

The Empire of the Isles wanes in power under his rule because his decision making is based mostly on his severely neurotic need for order, rather than on making decisions that will strengthen the country. This is largely his motivation for staging the coup that gets him into power in the first place. He later blames his ineffectiveness on the inability of everyone else to do as they're told.

And in the third game, The Agency outright refuses to let Rico go to his homeland and depose yet another bloodthirsty nuclear-armed dictator, because he possesses a very powerful new type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">Unobtanium</a>, and that makes him The Agency's best goddamn friend - prompting Rico to strike out on his own and work with the local rebels to free his homeland.

<ul><li> The Empire is run by Baron Klaus Wulphenbach, who is from a minor house but still managed to conquer via sheer power. He rules rather fairly after a vassal state joins, allowing all states freedom for their rules to rule as they see fit unless they posses forbidden Other technology or try to start a war. His "Pax Transylvania" is noted to mostly mean "don't make me come over there." Klaus' general paranoia, borne of running this empire and teaching with the Other, have left him unable to view <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Agatha</a> as anything but a threat.
</li><li> There's also the Storm King conspiracy, which intends to unseat Klaus by putting forward some member of the Sturmvoraus family (initially Tarvek but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> and the outcome of the Battle of Mechanisburg both led to more contenders). A major idea of the conspiracy was that the nobles would prefer a king with the proper lineage to a lesser noble like Klaus who simply has power.
<ul><li> As part of the the Storm King conspiracy we found out that Tarvek's father was a servant of the dead Lucrezia Mongfish (potentially the Other) and intended to resurrect her into her daughter, Agatha, so she could rule by using mind control. This clashed with another plan that had Zola pretend to be Lucrezia's daughter to try and take over Mechnisburg, the seat of the House of Hetrodyne (of which Agatha is heir).

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OttoVonBismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, a 19th century Prussian statesman who served as theFirst Chancellor to King Wilhelm I, advocated realpolitik as a means of uniting Germany. Specifically, this was in opposition to the democratic nationalist movements which attempted to unite Germany as a confederation in the 1830s and 1840s, whereas Bismarck's plan was to unite the German states under Prussian hegemony by uniting them against various external threats. Bismarck would utilize realpolitik again during the Franco-Prussian War, where
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> made his political career being a stalwart anticommunist, yet he and Henry Kissinger (his Secretary of State) were the ones who started the push for greater diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China starting with "ping-pong diplomacy" in 1971 and kicked off on a government level with Nixon's visit to China in 1972 - both held mutual distrust and suspicion of the Soviet Union at the time. Formal diplomatic relations were established in 1979, when the US ended official diplomatic recognition of the Republic of China (i.e., Taiwan).
<ul><li> This was also to help leverage better relations with the Soviet Union, intending to goad the USSR into becoming an ally out of jealousy of China's situation. (i.e. "Hey, China is Communist like us, and they're being friendly with the US while getting some benefits from doing so. Why can't that be us?"). It would also lift them the load of being allied with a country targeted for openly breaching human rights, which was impairing the American discourse of promoting democracy abroad.
</li><li> Not coincidentally, Nixon's strong anticommunist reputation was a big reason his administration was able to initiate the move to establish ties with China in the first place - said record helped to shield him from accusations that he was coddling to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">Dirty Communists</a> (something a more moderate president wouldn't have had). This legitimacy-by-previous-enmity is what is meant when it is said that "only Nixon could go to China" (regardless of how much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry">the Vulcans</a> may claim is theirs).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesDeGaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> summed this attitude up nicely: "Nations don't have friends, they only have interests."
</li><li> Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston spoke of this in the nineteenth century: "Therefore I say that it is a narrow policy to suppose that this country or that is to be marked out as the eternal ally or the perpetual enemy of England. We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow."
</li><li> Alexander III of Russia once said: "Russia has two allies: the Army and the Navy". However, he did initiate the Franco-Russian alliance of 1894 (which would play a crucial part in the run-up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>).
</li><li> The Melian dialogue in Thucydides' account of the Peloponnesian War is an example of how this trope can turn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a>. The Athenians asserted their dominance over the Melians due to the fact that they had far stronger military force, and could blackmail the Melians into accepting either submitting peacefully or being killed. The idea was that "the strong will do what they will and the weak will accept what they must".
</li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, Finland was in the awkward situation of being a liberal democracy with a mixed economy but also very vulnerable to direct attack by the Soviet Union. Or should we say, <em>renewed</em> direct attack by the Soviet Union, since the Soviets had actually tried to conquer Finland before (to the point where Helsinki was desperate enough to turn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> for help). As a result, Finland had every reason to want to join the West...but also every reason to <em>not</em> piss off the East. The result was a policy of doing everything in their power to avoid unnecessarily offending Moscow while trying to maintain good relations with the West; President Urho Kekkonen defined this policy as <em>art of bowing to East without mooning to West</em>, and stated <em>Find your friends near and your enemies far</em>. Nevertheless, the policy was criticized in some anti-Communist circles, to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChancellorsOfGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheChancellorsOfGermany">Willy Brandt</a>'s <em>Neue Ostpolitik</em> ("New Eastern Policy", i.e. detente with the Soviet bloc in general and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EastGermany">East Germany</a> in particular) was derogatorily called "Finlandization" by many members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalSystemOfGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalSystemOfGermany">CDU/CSU</a>.
<ul><li> A staggering example of this occured during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, when the Soviet Union asked Finland to help them find a way to invade Norway. Finland obliged, but decided to work so slowly that the whole thing was stalled, and the Soviets eventually abandoned the idea.
</li></ul></li><li> One example of this was the Western Allies allying with the Soviet Union during World War II. On one side, you had a group of largely democratic countries (most of which, admittedly, had large, distinctly un-democratically-run Empires) who had a strong history of anti-Communism. On the other, you had a totalitarian Communist state which had killed nearly a million of its own people as ideological enemies and imprisoned a few million more. What brought them together— the <em>only</em> thing, even —was a common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Those Wacky Nazis</a> and Italian fascism. While this did lead to beneficial co-operation between the two powers, it also led to things such as what some have termed <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_betrayal">the Western Betrayal.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Winston Churchill, a vehement anti-Communist, rather famously summed it up as:
<div class="indent"> If Hitler invaded Hell, I would make at least a favorable reference to the devil in the House of Commons.
</div><ul><li> Allied Realpolitik after the war resulted in actions such as "Operation Paperclip", the de-Nazification of scientists and technical personnel who had built the V2 Rockets for Germany, often using slave labor from concentration camps in dreadful conditions. Indeed, more people were killed making these rockets than the rockets did on its own. The most notorious is Wernher von Braun. The reason for this absorption was that the USA wanted to make sure that the Soviet Union, in the early stages of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, didn't get a leg-up in the space race (they failed).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosephStalin">Joseph Stalin</a> was also one hell of a pragmatist - firstly, he <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapallo_Treaty">organized<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> mutual aid with Weimar Germany, as they were both troubled pariah states, despite Germany being a capitalist republic. He also abandoned Lenin's ideas of world revolution, focusing on "Building socialism in one country", and hijacked Trotsky's ideas of hyper-industrialisation. After Hitler's takeover, he still traded with Germany; then he tried to ally with the Entente against Hitler; after seeing their reluctance to stop him, he <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov&lt;!--E2--&gt;80%93Ribbentrop_Pact">negotiated<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with Hitler, despite his rabid anti-communism, while re-arming and organizing the army. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> he united Russians with ideas of succession between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsarist Russia</a> and the USSR, glorifying old-time heroes like Alexander Nevsky or Admiral Ushakov, painting old invaders like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a> or Teutonic Knights as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">A Nazi by Any Other Name</a>. After the war, despite anti-Semitic politics, he lobbied the UN for the creation of Israel.
</li><li> The U.S. protected the majority of war criminals from the infamous Unit 731 in the Imperial Japanese Army and gave them political and legal immunity from prosecution in exchange for their cooperation in American bioweapons research. Almost all the core members of Unit 731 were notorious for conducting truly horrific experimentation on unwilling <em>live</em> subjects (mostly Chinese, White Russians and Koreans, although a few American, British and New Zealand <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POWs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/POWs">PO Ws</a> were also subjected to the experiments), such as vivisecting people while they were unconscious, forcing prisoners into pressure chambers to watch how they died and herding entire village populations into huge chambers to be killed by the full effects of bubonic plague, anthrax or frostbite. By securing cooperation from the war criminals, the U.S. demanded that they shared the data obtained through those experiments with them. It should be noted, though, that the members didn't tell the Americans <em>how</em> they got the data, but simply the results. When the U.S. Government actually discovered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithSyringes">just how the Unit conducted their so-called research</a>, many were so horrified that a number of ex-Unit members were pulled from U.S. bioweapons projects and handed over to the Soviets, who either executed or imprisoned them. It's worth noting that many in the West, including the U.S. government, dismissed witness reports about the activities of Unit 731 as "communist propaganda".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">Nationalist China</a>, the fourth major Allied power, is an interesting case. The regime was a military dictatorship under Generalissimo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChiangKaiShek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChiangKaiShek">Chiang Kai-shek</a>, controlling China as a single-party state. The Kuomintang ruling party encompassed various bickering wings, from socialists to traditionalists. However, each wing was kept united under Chiang, who settled on a centrist position. This let China get foreign aid from Nazi Germany and the USSR throughout the 1930s. When China joined the Allies in 1941, it was America that took the most interest. America had plenty of business and missionary interests in China, and FDR believed that the nation deserved to become a world power (with American guidance). So Chiang decided to convince Roosevelt that China could potentially become a liberal democracy. This had some basis in fact - the KMT under Chiang was in the "People's Tutelage" stage theorized by its founder, democratic socialist Dr. Sun Yat-sen, which prepared the people for democracy through single-party rule. Although the Americans initially believed this, it soon became abundantly clear that Chiang's government was a <em>very</em> corrupt authoritarian regime with no interest in transforming into a democracy anytime soon. Said corruption and the KMT's terrible policy record on domestic issues disillusioned many American personnel. Yet China's contribution - tying down half of the IJA in China to stop them from re-inforcing Japan's Pacific territories - was invaluable to the Allied war effort. Roosevelt also maintained good relations with Chiang (it helped both men had much in common, such as being staunch anti-imperialists). As a result, the U.S. did provide China with military aid and tried their best to prop up Chiang's government. By 1945, China had regained several territories (including Taiwan) from Japan, ended most of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unequal_treaty">unequal treaties<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and was a permanent member of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council">UN Security Council<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However, corruption had worsened and the regime was struggling to hold itself up after eight years of destructive fighting. The U.S. eventually got frustrated with Chiang and withdrew aid during the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War">Chinese Civil War<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which was one of the decisive factors in the eventual communist victory. Chiang, realizing that he had lost, fled to Taiwan in 1949 and set up shop there. The U.S. and Chiang re-established relations, with Truman realizing the importance of an anti-communist bulwark in East Asia. It wasn't until 1973 that the U.S. (and most Western nations) finally acknowledged the PRC as the "real" China, in no small part due to the increasingly influential Chinese economy.
</li></ul></li><li> During the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>, the rationale for the democratic US to prop up, support, and aid autocratic strongman regimes and dictatorships with dubious, if not outright brutal and horrific human rights records just to fight Communism, even overthrowing democratic regimes to make way for such autocracies or totalitarian juntas, was based upon realpolitik. Whether it worked or was effective or not, or whether more humane decisions could have been made to fight Communism (i.e: letting the countries remain democratic and try to work with them) is a very controversial topic when examining US history. The U.S. has pursued a similar policy in their dealings with the Middle East, with the goals being (a) keeping oil prices reasonable, and (b) minimizing overt hostilities between Israel and her neighbors.
</li><li> This also happens in domestic elections, where (most) candidates, if they're losing in the primaries, will graciously bow out so as not to "fracture the party" and allow someone who they'd vehemently disagree with win over someone they only partially disagree with. Not doing so is what led to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> causing Taft's defeat to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WoodrowWilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, and is largely credited as being a main factor in the 2000 US election, where Ralph Nader split the vote from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlGore">Al Gore</a>.
<ul><li> This also contributed to the defeat of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</a> in 2016. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BernieSanders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BernieSanders">Bernie Sanders</a>' supporters were disillusioned with Clinton's primary victory, especially in light of tactics used by the DNC that favored Clinton over Bernie. In the lead up and initial follow up, many feared that defeat would happen if enough of the Sanders' supporters were ticked off enough to vote for third-party candidates. As it turns out, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookAThirdOption">took a fourth option and didn't vote at all</a>. It should be noted that this isn't the first time Hillary's primary support caused trouble. In 2008, she stayed in the primary for far longer than most Obama supporters wanted and turned to some tactics that turned off many independent voters. While the party still managed to win in the general election, a Democratic victory wasn't nearly as assured as it had been in the beginning of the primary season.
</li><li> The Irony of Gore's loss is that he became Vice President because of this causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeHWBush">George H. W. Bush</a>'s loss to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> (The President Gore served as Veep too) in 1992, thanks to Ross Perot splitting the vote. Bill Clinton, although winning both his presidential elections, never received the majority of the Popular Vote (only the plurality) because of this as well. He remains the only President to twice be elected despite never having a majority of the popular vote.
</li></ul></li><li> During general elections where there are more than two major parties, if a voter finds their preferred candidate is not popular enough to get elected they will vote for a candidate they only mostly agree with to keep out someone they really dislike.
<ul><li> In Canada, prior to the 2015 federal election, there were open discussions among voters about strategic voting between the NDP and the Liberals in order to knock the Conservatives—who had been in power for 10 years, never with an absolute majority of the vote—out of office. What they suggested was that in ridings where it was quite clear that either the Liberal candidate or NDP candidate would probably be in third place that said third-place candidate's potential voters should instead vote for the candidate (Liberal or NDP) who would be in <em>second</em> place, which would, theoretically, allow them to beat the Conservative who would otherwise win a three-way (or more) race by a plurality.
</li><li> In the 2016 US Presidential elections, both candidates were polling below 50% for much of the campaign. (One poll among millennials found that both candidates polled lower than a third term for Obama, a machine that would select at random one eligible person who wasn't Donald Trump or Hilary Clinton, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Armageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Armageddon">a meteor the size of Texas striking the planet</a>.) A few optimists saw the possibility of a third party voting would increase, but in the end, many people voted for one candidate because they could not stand the other. In the end, overall voting was a record low (in spite of record early voter turn out), but exit polling revealed that Donald Trump actually did a few points better with minority votes than 2012 candidate Mitt Romney while Hilary Clinton had lost a larger percentage of minority voters than the gains seen by Trump (indicating other candidates or non-voting).
</li><li> The concept of Ranked Choice Voting is designed to eliminate these calculations. In RCV, you explicitly indicate your first choice, your second choice etc., and your ballot gets automatically re-allocated if your first choice loses in an early round of counting.
</li></ul></li><li> In pre-<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WW2">WW 2</a> Germany, this is why the Communist Party inadvertently lead to the rise of Nazism. Rather than form alliances with other moderate or left-leaning parties like the Social Democrats, the Communists instead prioritized ideological purity and denounced all parties as fascistic. Had the Communists formed a coalition with the Socialists, they would've outnumbered the Nazis in the Reichstag and would've been represented with an anti-Nazi Chancellor. Subsequently, the Communists's sectarian feuds weakened the opposition, thereby allowing the Nazis to seize control. Upon taking over the government, the Nazis promptly banned the Communist Party and had its members either imprisoned or executed.
