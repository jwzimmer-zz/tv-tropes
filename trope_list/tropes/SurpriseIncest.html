<em>Haha! Guess what you were doing?</em>
</p><p>Sometimes in stories, two people meet and just seem destined for romance. Love blossoms in a particular way, or perhaps the two have a loveless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> lying in wait for them instead. But then, someone makes a startling discovery — genetics has struck! The couple-to-be are related — and not in the "same species" sense — and the romance or arranged marriage is called off. The result may be either great rejoicing or great despair. If it's <em>not</em> called off despite the consanguinity issue, intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> results. Or if the two still want to be together and the author doesn't want to go the incest route, a counter-reveal may show up to prove that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">the genetics aren't a problem after all</a>.
</p><p>These days, many people are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicked</a> out by this, so the characters often find out <em>before</em> they tie the knot/do the nasty. This wasn't always the case; Oedipus was very happily (but unknowingly) married to his own mother for many years and had several kids with her before things fell apart (to the extent that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> resulted in Oedipus' mother killing herself and Oedipus himself stabbing his own eyes out), so this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. Still, this trope is surprisingly common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga">manga</a>, as well as other Japanese entertainment, due to much more relaxed views on the subject in Japan.

In fact, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArabianNights">Arabian Nights</a></em>, a man will call a woman he loves or is married to "daughter of my uncle" because, in that time, marriage between cousins was considered the best option! Because of this, it almost never appears as a plot point since it's a little too close for some folks to be comfortable, but not close enough that the plot demands the relationship break up.
</p><p>The relationship is more like to be on the paternal side, because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe</a>. Historically was a fairly common way of making the Veronica of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BettyAndVeronica">Betty and Veronica</a> off-limits.

Each girl came believing that she was the twin sister. They find out about each other and realize that they each have a 50/50 chance of being the twin. They both fall in love with the man a few episodes <em>after</em> this. The irony being the anime had one of the girls be the guy's sister, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Novelization">novelization</a> had the other one.

This turns into a deconstruction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a>, as the two struggle to resist their mutual attraction while living in the same house but eventually go on to develop a painful and guilt-ridden romantic relationship against their better judgment, fully aware of the devastating implications if their secret got out, but both unwilling to live without the other.

They never really got around to doing anything, but they definitely looked like the usual romantic pairing all the way up to the last five episodes of the series.

I've never told anyone this, but you need to know ... many years ago I had an affair with her mother, and, well..." Horrified, the young man runs out of the room where his mother asks what the problem is. He explains "I'm in love with the girl next door, but Dad says he's her father!" And his mother replies, "Don't worry about that. He might be <em>her</em> father, but he's not yours!"

MacCartney grows to idolize his savior Evelina in a quasi-romantic fashion. However, at the end of the novel, Evelina is revealed to be his real sister, while his original beloved was an unwitting (and unrelated) impostor.
</li><li> In "The Maias", by Eça de Queiroz, Pedro goes a long way until finding out Maria, the married woman he's been obsessing over, is his long-lost sister (not even half-sister or anything). Not that it matters to him.
</li><li> Henry Fielding seems to like to subvert this trope for particular effect: In <em>Joseph Andrews</em>, the hero thinks for a while that his childhood sweetheart is his sister; while in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfTomJonesAFoundling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHistoryOfTomJonesAFoundling">The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling</a></em>, a random one night stand is later seemingly revealed to be the protagonist's mother...

During a subsequent horseback ride, Theon begins feeling up the woman in a sexual manner (this is the series that led to the phrase "sexposition" being coined) and she not only doesn't object, she seems to take pleasure from it. A few minutes later, Theon (and the audience) get squicked when he learns that woman he was making out with was his <em>sister</em>, Yara, whom he hasn't seen since she was a child, and that she was aware the entire time and played along mostly to see how he'd react in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>.

However, while Jon has sworn his undevoted allegiance to her and expresses no interest in disputing her claim, he is much more uncomfortable with their consanguinity, rebuffing Dany's romantic advances afterwards.</span>

Greg and Anne never had sex, though it wasn't because of any lack of trying on Greg's part.

The man himself is utterly horrified, nearly throttled by the husband and it's reported he's on suicide watch. His daughter's reaction?

</li><li> An unusual example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em>. Vampire Bill finds out his human squeeze Portia Bellefluer is actually his great-great granddaughter, but Bill is the only one who's grossed out by this. Portia is more than willing to continue their relationship (and great sex), citing logical reasons why this shouldn't affect them (e.g. their genetic differences are about the same as with any other person and vampires can't produce children anyway, and most states are rethinking their cousin-marrying laws). Nonetheless, Bill is simply too uncomfortable to continue a relationship with her, so he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">glamours</a> her into being utterly terrified of him just so she will leave him alone.

<ul><li> The big reveal of Type O Negative's "Stay out of my dreams" is this trope.
<div class="indent">With your straight black hair and emerald green eyes <br/>Hippies pointing "that's Pete's sister in disguise" <br/>Maybe you had uttered those words as a jest <br/>I don't mind the allegations of incest <br/>At the time I thought I could love no other <br/>Till I heard you say that I was your brother <br/>In your e-mail said how much we look like twins <br/>How it turned you on just knowing it's a sin
</div></li><li> The second verse of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>'s "A Complicated Song" provides the page quote. After discovering his girlfriend is his cousin, the narrator wonders if he should still stay with her, have inbred kids with 11 toes, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">move to Alabama where that kind of thing is tolerated</a>".
<div class="indent">I was feelin' pretty down <br/>'Til my girlfriend came around <br/><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveSecondForeshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveSecondForeshadowing">We're just so alike in every way</a> <br/>I gotta say <br/><br/>In fact, I just thought I might <br/>Pop the question there that night <br/>I was kissing her so tenderly <br/>But woe is me <br/><br/>For who would have guessed <br/>Her family crest <br/>I'd suddenly spy <br/>Tattooed on her thigh? <br/>And son of a gun <br/>It's just like the one <br/>On me
</div></li><li> The song "Son Don't Go Near the Indians" — The whole time the main character of the Western song is told "Son don't go near the Indians, please stay away." Reverse psychology plays its part, and he goes near the Indians — a lot. He falls in love with a girl there about his age. Near the end, they resolve to get married. Only then does his father explain that his actual son got killed by the Indians, so he stole one of their baby boys, the protagonist, and that his girlfriend is his sister. "And that's why I've always said — 'Son, don't go near the Indians, please stay away'"
<ul><li> Subverted in the related song (most likely a parody) "Son Don't Go Near the Eskimo" which leads the listener to suspect a similar conclusion, making the big reveal (the girlfriend is not his sister, but she has "the coldest nose in Alaska") somewhat anticlimactic.
</li></ul></li><li> In the folk song "I'm My Own Grandpa," the narrator marries an older woman with an adult daughter. The narrator's father then marries the daughter, making the son's stepdaughter his stepmother. Because the narrator is married to his stepmother's mother, he has become his own step-grandfather. Not actually incest, either.
<ul><li> A real life example was avoided when Mandy Smith's mother broke up with Rolling Stone Bill Wyman's son. Smith and Wyman were married at the time, giving Smith a narrow escape from becoming her own step-granddaughter-in-law.

</li><li> The song "Butterflies" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Sia">Sia</a> plays this on the listeners. It sounds like just a regular song about lingering awkwardness in a relationship, until the very last line right at the end of the song, when she casually remarks "Because we came from the same cocoon".
</li><li> Cornelis Vreeswijk's <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_JJaay6i_c">Incestvisan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> (Incest Song) has a similar structure an example named above: Boy meets girls, falls in love. Dad intervenes, claiming they are his sisters. Boy then talks to mom, mom: "Oh, don't worry, he's probably right but he's not YOUR father anyway..."
</li><li> Frank Zappa's "Magdalena" is a lengthy and detailed confessional by a Canadian maple syrup salesman to his teen-age daughter of what he'd like to do to her.
<ul><li> There's also "Brown Shoes Don't Make It", with this exchange, repeated three times:
<div class="indent"><strong>Man</strong>: If she were my daughter I'd...
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Girl</strong>: What would you do, Daddy?
</div></li></ul></li><li> The folk song "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.lyricsdownload.com/sainte-marie-buffy-johnny-be-fair-lyrics.html">Johnny Be Fair<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" parodies this. The female narrator repeatedly falls in love with men, only for her father to pull out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a> because he's <em>their</em> father too. In the end, she goes to her mother, who says "he's not really your father, marry anyone you want". It dates back to Elizabethan times and probably further.
</li><li> Gothic Americana might not exist as a genre without this trope. Slim Cesna's Auto Club has an EP named "Crossbreeding Begins at Home." Similarly, about half of Jay Munly's oeuvre seems to rely upon this trope. If you're curious, look up the lyrics to "Big Black Bull Comes Like a Caesar" and "There's a Goose Walking Over My Grave."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> wrote a jaunty, upbeat "theme song" for <em>Oedipus Rex</em>.
<div class="indent"> <em>When he found what he had done, he tore his eyes out, one by one. A tragic end to a loyal son who ...</em> <em><strong>loved his mother</strong></em>.
</div></li><li> Harry Chapin's "The Mayor of Candor Lied" is a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">bone-chilling</a> twist on this one: boy meets girl, girl's father disapproves, ostensibly because the boy is poor. Boy catches his mother with her father and blackmails him into letting boy and girl be together. Then her father takes her overseas on vacation and doesn't bring her back, and in the ensuing confrontation, the boy suddenly notices how much the girl's father looks like him...

She is somewhat reluctant to marry even before she falls in love with Hero. But everything ends happily when a set of matching rings proves Miles and his prospective bride are long-lost siblings, enabling the hero and heroine to marry.
</li><li> The Roman comedy trope used in <em>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</em> was used more seriously in Gotthold Ephraim Lessing's play <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NathanTheWise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NathanTheWise">Nathan The Wise</a></em>—the title character is Jewish and it is revealed that his daughter is actually not a blood relative.

The scene becomes either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">squicky</a> or more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">hilarious</a> afterwards depending on how perverted your sense of humor is</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> series, Imoen and the main character (if he's male) have the sort of sorta flirty relationship you'd expect from lifelong friends of opposing genders. For that matter, if the main character's female they have the sorta flirty relationship you'd expect from lifelong friends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlsLove">of that sort</a>. When <em>Baldur's Gate II</em> was released and Imoen was not one of the characters with whom you could pursue a romantic relationship, a lot of fans of the original were very surprised and rather disappointed... until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you found out that Imoen was your half-sister</span>.
<ul><li> This is actually brought up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateIIThroneOfBhaal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateIIThroneOfBhaal">Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal</a></em> if the main character's male. Viconia insists to Imoen that given the number of times he's saved her life, she should serve him in <em>every</em> way. Imoen acts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicked</a> and cites why. Viconia brushes it off, pointing out that the common heritage would hardly one of <em>blood</em>. Imoen then notes that — canonically by that point — the main character has saved <em>Viconia</em>'s life at <em>least</em> twice...
</li><li> Some people did a mod that allows this relationship; the Imoen Romance mod for <em>Baldur's Gate II</em> is alive and well, and is widely known for near-total freedom of choice in the protagonist's options. Imoen is romanceable by both males and females, and to the mod's credit, does not shy away from the incest issue — Imoen in particular has issues with it.

While they're half-naked on the ground making out. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">They didn't take it well</a>, and lines like "We did so much!" imply there was more than just lips involved, though they seemed to have gotten over it by the end of the episode, apparently realizing that (given who they are) they were lucky to hook up with anyone at all that night.
</li><li> In "Valentine's Day in Quahog", Stewie decides to go back in time to the 60s to see what love was like. During the trip, he falls for a girl and kisses her, only to find out it is really Lois after she is picked up by Carl Pewterschmidt. Stewie ends up vomiting all the way back to the present.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> had a version of this in an episode where Roger painted a nude portrait of Hayley for an art class, then rented it out to Steve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms">masturbation material</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1g711');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1g711" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1g711');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">he didn't know it was her because the painting stopped at her lips</span>. Hayley is naturally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicked</a> and tries to put a stop to it; at the end of the episode, Roger drops the bomb, which horrifies poor Steve (rather than blaming him, Hayley is sympathetic and just gets angrier at Roger for manipulating him).
<ul><li> In another episode Roger plays a prank where he makes Steve believe that Francine and Stan aren't his real parents. Under his false impression, he suddenly kisses a horrified Hayley, to Roger's delight.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em>, Roberta wears a fat suit using a fake name to see if she can get by without her looks, and sure enough, the only person who treats her kindly is her stepbrother, Junior. Unfortunately, he soon develops a crush on her, and she has to pretend to move away to avoid breaking his heart or revealing the truth.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode "Roswell that Ends Well" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>. While stuck in 1947, Fry accidentally gets his grandfather killed and figures that since he still exists, the attractive woman he thought was his grandmother couldn't possibly be. After he does "the nasty in the past-y", Professor Farnsworth explains to Fry that not only is she his grandmother after all, Fry's grandfather is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Fry himself</a></span>.

Joe: A Real American Hero</a></em>, Lady Jaye once infiltrated Cobra by impersonating the Baroness. At one point, she kisses Baroness' boyfriend Destro. A later episode revealed Lady Jaye and Destro share common ancestors.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a>:</em> Joseph is getting closer to a girl who is actually his half-sister (since he remains ignorant about John Redcorn being his biological father).

<ul><li> Also subverted in another episode: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">Bill</a> goes back to his family's home and meets three women who want to jump his bones. The catch is that one is his blood cousin while the others are the widows of his male cousins, and he doesn't know which is which. By the end of the episode, he figures it out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDateless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDateless">manages to sleep with both of the others</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the episodes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MikeTysonMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MikeTysonMysteries">Mike Tyson Mysteries</a></em> involves a couple who doesn't want their daughter to marry a man.

They end up marrying despite being related (and the fact the man is half-pig). Mike and his friends are grossed out by it all.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> has Mayor Quimby telling his date at a wedding to say she's his niece if anyone asks.

Marcia reluctantly explains to John that they can't marry because she's his twin sister, from whom he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedAtBirth">Separated at Birth</a> during a hospital blackout.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder18');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder18" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Jacobson">an incident in Virginia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where a doctor (secretly) used his own sperm for all his artificial inseminations, meaning that a community now has many couples who might well be half-siblings.
</li><li> A Minnesota school hosts a pep assembly. Part of it is having various athletes receiving blindfolded special kisses from a secret admirer... <a class="urllink" href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-12-16/news/30526908_1_pep-rally-viral-videos-prank">their parents.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> This is a classic pep rally "gag" of long tradition, though normally it is much more innocent. Blindfolded football players are told they must guess which cheerleader kissed them (usually just a chaste peck on the cheek)...lift blindfold — surprise! It was actually Mom — ha-ha. (Embarrassment and teasing ensue.) However, in the incident referenced above, parents were practically making out with their kids.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened to no less than <a class="urllink" href="http://www.spoliamag.com/the-time-casanova-almost-accidentally-married-his-daughter/">Giacomo Casanova<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. According to his autobiography, he was on the verge of marrying a beautiful seventeen-year-old girl when he recognized the girl's mother as a former lover... from seventeen years earlier. She confirmed the girl was his. In real life he broke off the engagement immediately; in his liberally fictionalized autobiography, however, he cheerfully admits to an incestuous threesome, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">impregnated</a> the daughter with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">son/grandson</a> years later when they meet again.
</li><li> Chevalier de Villiers entered high society under the tutelage of French philosopher and patron of the arts <a class="urllink" href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/lenclos/">Anne "Ninon" de l'Enclos<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Ninon, a (former) courtesan and beauty, had drawn the hearts of men to her throughout her life, and the heart of the Chevalier was no exception. He proclaimed his love and passion for her, only to be sent away. After begging for the privilege of seeing her again, he violated the condition of truce and declared his love once more. Using the reason of age, Ninon claimed that it would be unbecoming of her sixty-five years (to his 20s) to love and be loved. The Chevalier wouldn't take "no" for an answer, and Ninon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakHisHeartToSaveHim">withdrew even her friendship</a> from him. Upon discovery that the Chevalier had fallen into despair and fury on account of her rejection, she elected to see him to tell him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth">Awful Truth</a>: "The lover you are pursuing is your mother." Ninon burst into tears and held her son to her heart, and the Chevalier — who could not bring himself to utter the name 'mother' to the one whom he felt such a burning passion for — trembled, stared longingly into her eyes, and fled into the garden with a deep sigh. Ninon followed, and beneath the starry sky, the image before her was that of her son weltering in his own blood, shed by his own hand for his love for her. His dying eyes turned toward her and still shone of ardent love for her, and he passed while still uttering words of endearment.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Ninon</strong>: It is my son who sighs at my feet, who talks to me of love.
</div></li><li> There was a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jan/11/allegrastratton">case in the UK<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where twins who were separated at birth got married without realizing they were related. They had the marriage annulled after they discovered the truth.
</li><li> Somewhere in Britain there allegedly is a gravestone raised in the late 17th century to a woman who was the buyer's "mother, sister, mistress and wife". Apparently the deceased was impregnated as a young woman by her own father; the baby boy was sent to another village and came back a man, started an affair with an older woman he met there and later married her, and only then did she recognise a birthmark on his body...
</li></ul><ul><li> Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iceland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Iceland">Iceland</a> having a rather small population with no last names, there is apparently a smartphone app meant solely to avert this trope.
</li><li> One of the concerns with donor children not knowing who their parents are, is the potential for this issue. Its actually more likely to happen than people realize, possibly related to the known phenomena of people marrying those who smell like their biological parents.
