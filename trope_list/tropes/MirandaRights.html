</div></div><p>In the United States, the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution provide valuable rights to those arrested or accused of a crime, be you innocent or guilty... provided you remember they exist. Not easy when your hands are in cuffs and your face is being smashed against the trunk of a police cruiser. Until the 1966 Supreme Court decision in <em><a class="urllink" href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=384&amp;invol=436">Miranda v. Arizona<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, from which the term Miranda Rights got their name, the police were <em>very</em> unlikely to remind you of those rights.

</p><p></p><div class="indent"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockPhrase">You have the right to remain silent</a>. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning and at trial. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.
</div><p>In some states the following is added:
</p><p></p><div class="indent"> Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me? (Or: "... do you wish to make a statement?")

Some common deviations from reality:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p></p><ul><li> In some movies or series, the rights are an inevitable part of every climax. In others, perps <em>never</em> seem to get their <em>Miranda</em> rights read to them when they are arrested. The latter case is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">more realistic</a>: police will only read the Miranda Rights to anyone they want to interrogate, and they'll usually do so just prior to interrogation, rather than as their suspect is being arrested.
<p></p></li><li> When we see someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonAsVerb">Mirandized</a>, fictional officers almost always recite the text from memory, as if they've said the words for years by heart. In reality, while officers certainly do memorize the words over time, they are still required to read the rights <em>from a card,</em> to avoid mistakes that could get the case thrown out. This is because <em>any</em> deviation from the actual rights as printed means the suspect was not properly read their rights. In addition, suspects are required to sign the card, as evidence in case they late deny having been read their rights.
<p></p></li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> In fiction, the Mirandizing officer is likely to stop when a jaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolicalMastermind">criminal mastermind</a> mutters, "Yeah yeah, I know my rights..." In reality, they <em>can't</em>, because the law requires that an officer inform a suspect of their rights, whether they claim to know them or not.
<p></p></li><li> In fiction, the officer might be tempted to interrupt the reading of rights to suggest an obnoxious suspect <em>really should</em> take advantage of their right to remain silent, or to modify the "if you cannot afford an attorney" with sarcastic references to a wealthy suspect's obvious ability to afford one. In reality, as mentioned above, <em>any</em> deviation from the words written on the card could be used by a defense attorney to claim that their client was not properly read their rights.
<p></p></li><li> In fiction, sometimes suspects get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">Off on a Technicality</a> because the arresting officer forgot to read their Miranda Rights<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18c7g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18c7g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18c7g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which was the case in <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em> itself</span>. Setting aside how unlikely this would be, this tends to be incorrectly treated as automatically resulting in dismissing the case. It is rarely brought up that this only affects any statements the suspect made under arrest. Any evidence the police had uncovered by unrelated means would still be valid. In addition, the law presumes that a person's rights <em>were</em> read to them unless clear evidence to the contrary (usually in the form of a statement from a reliable eyewitness) is presented in writing prior to the trial.
</li></ul><p>The only time in which <em>Miranda</em> can be waived is in cases where "public safety" is under immediate threat and the officer does not have the time or wherewithal to lecture the perp for 30 seconds. The usual example is the hypothetical case where an officer catches a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">Mad Bomber</a> in a mall and demands to know where the bomber stashed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeBomb">Time Bomb</a>, but exceptions must be approved on an individual basis. And even if the suspect is not Mirandized prior to interrogation, the evidence gained can still be used by police to justify further action. While they may not be allowed to bring up the interrogation in court, they <em>can</em> bring up the fact they found a bomb and the bomber's fingerprints were all over it.
</p><p>Even in cases where an <em>illegal</em> interrogation results in a confession or other evidence discovered as a direct result being ruled inadmissible (the so called "fruit of the poisonous tree" doctrine) there are rare occasions where the police can make the "inevitable discovery" claim, essentially stating that they would have discovered the evidence even without the interrogation ("We would have found evidence of the bomb anyway, since it would have blown up, and an explosion in a mall would certainly have been investigated.")
</p><p>People aren't always Mirandized upon arrest either; sometimes, the police will arrest a suspect, get him or her into an interrogation room and on camera, and <em>then</em> read his or her rights, to ensure that the suspect's response (usually waiving the rights) is recorded. It used to be accepted procedure in some police departments to interrogate people until they were convinced to confess, and <em>then</em> Mirandize them and have them repeat what they'd said "for the official record;" this is now considered to be coercion (meaning said statements could not be used against people in court).
</p><p>And obviously, undercover officers do not need to read rights (the police only need to read them to people they're interrogating who have been <em>arrested</em>; if the police are asking questions but the person is free to leave, they do not have to be read their rights).
</p><p>Incidentally, if you are ever Mirandized, even if you are convinced you've done nothing wrong (in fact, <em>especially</em> if you are convinced you've done nothing wrong), the <em>only</em> words out of your mouth should be "I want a lawyer and will not consider answering questions until I have one." See <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for 49 minutes of extremely enlightening and entertaining education on the topic.

</p><p>The British version is (oddly enough) a little less formal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNotHaveToSayAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNotHaveToSayAnything">You Do Not Have to Say Anything</a>.

<ul><li> A variation happens in the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiUniverse">Tenchi Universe</a></em> where Mihoshi tries to read Ryoko her rights.

<ul><li> Apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> is expected to read rights to captured villains: failure to do so lets one crook off the hook in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em>; and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em>, Lex Luthor implies Superman's failure to read him his <em>Miranda</em> rights (and testify in court) helped him weasel out of two life sentences. So, wait, Superman is a cop?
<ul><li> Well, your regular officer isn't going to have much luck holding down a man who can shoot laser beams out of his hands without being evaporated.
</li><li> In one comic (during the John Byrne years) Superman was deputized as a police officer so Lex Luthor (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corporate</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Bastard</a> version) could be arrested. Perhaps it stuck?
</li><li> There's also Dan Turpin, one of the toughest cops in Metropolis, who never memorized the <em>Miranda</em> speech. He has to read it off a card (which, of course, is generally what real cops do). This is actually a plot point in one story where everyone in Metropolis <em>except</em> Dan got superpowers (because, as it turned out, he didn't want them). At the end of the story, they find the professor responsible. When Dan can't read the card-because he doesn't have his glasses-the professor grabs it out of his hand and starts to read it himself, it says "Mxyzptlk" backwards, and the professor is forced to reveal he's really Mr. Mxyzptlk. Superman switched out the card.
</li></ul></li><li> Hilariously parodied in Spanish comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Pafman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Pafman">Pafman</a></em>, the main characters say the lines "everything you say could be used against you". The bad guy ask what that does mean, so they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">take the speech balloon</a> that contains this question and smash it in his face.

In Issue #39, the Archer steals police equipment and gives it to criminals. After handcuffing a cop, one of those criminals tells another one to read the cop's <em>wrongs</em>.
</li><li> In the "Molly &amp; Poo" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrangersInParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/StrangersInParadise">Strangers in Paradise</a></em>, Molly gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">Off on a Technicality</a> in spite of overwhelming evidence of her being a murderer (as in, she was found naked and covered in the blood of her dismembered victim holding a cleaver and their heart) because the arresting officers thought the detective handling the case would do that in the precint and the detective thought the arresting officers had already done so.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> franchise, we typically cut away just after a CSI tells a detective to, "Read him his rights." On the original <em>CSI</em>, the criminalists are not police officers, so they aren't actually legally empowered to perform the arrest.

The perp is cuffed, and a Detective will begin with "You have the right to remain silent, anything you do say..." as the scene fades to commercial. We are to assume the rest of the speech was given without having to waste camera time. In fact, if the entire <em>Miranda</em> speech is given on camera, it's a pretty good bet that much of Act II will be spent with the suspect arguing he wasn't Mirandized properly, or some other procedural technicality related to such. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em> may have been one of the first shows to demonstrate not only the legal repercussions of not advising suspects of their Fifth Amendment rights, but also ways that botching the warning doesn't mean the perp is automatically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">Off on a Technicality</a>.

<ul><li> <em>NCIS</em> also occasionally reads a member of the military his or her "Article 31s."

Naturally, when they come to the "If you cannot afford a lawyer" part, Lex shouts that he can afford a thousand lawyers.
<ul><li> In an episode where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> was pitting all of Metropolis against him, the public demands that Superman present various documents allowing him to fly (e.g. a pilot's license), his Social Security number (proving he pays taxes; which he does, just not as Superman), etc. When he catches a crook, the cops immediately let him go explaining that Supes didn't Mirandize him. Superman points out that the cops are usually the ones to do it.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceAnEpisode">Once an Episode</a> (at least) on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser">The Closer</a></em>. Part of Brenda Johnson's skill as an interrogator is in getting suspects to waive those rights and/or slip up in the interview room. A common tactic for her is to persuade the suspects to revoke their Miranda rights and confess. In one episode, there's an inversion: Brenda tells the suspect how the murder was committed; once the suspect agrees with Brenda and admits guilt, only then does Brenda have her rights read and arrest her, since legally that's considered a spontaneous confession.
<ul><li> In spinoff <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MajorCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MajorCrimes">Major Crimes</a></em>, Captain Raydor will usually advise suspects of their Miranda rights, and then advise them that if they call a lawyer, the chances of a plea-bargain deal go out the window.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser">The Closer</a></em> violates them in nearly every episode, when suspects ask for lawyers and have questions asked as 'minor things' while the lawyer is coming (technically this would mean that whatever the suspect said would be inadmissible, but any evidence found because of what they said would be allowed).
</li></ul></li><li> Many writers add "editorial comments" from the arresting officer, as with this example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser">The Closer</a></em>:
<dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Sanchez</strong>: "...any stupid thing you say will be used against you. You have the right to an attorney. If your broke ass can't afford one, one will be provided..."

<ul><li> In the original 1950's radio and TV shows, being Mirandized never happened - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">because the show predated the Miranda decision.</a>
</li><li> The '60s revival started just after the <em>Miranda</em> decision, so this happened frequently, with (usually) Sgt. Friday telling the person under interrogation at the beginning of said interrogation rather than at arrest.
</li><li> One notable Mirandizing came when Friday and his captain were busting a crooked cop on the take with a bookie operation. Once they had gathered all their evidence, the bad cop was brought into the captain's office with Friday present, and Friday tossed him a notebook (with the Miranda rights printed on the cover) and asked the suspect to read what was on the cover aloud. So in essence, the bad cop Mirandized himself, and didn't cotton on until Friday asked him if he understood his rights.
</li><li> Also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve">Adam-12</a></em>, which made sure to show Malloy or Reed pull a Miranda card out of their breast pocket to read suspects their rights.

Since his retirement project was to catch criminals who were getting acquitted on "technicalities," he wanted to make sure he followed procedure (even though, come to think of it, a retired judge isn't a cop, either).
<ul><li> Having been schooled by Hardcastle, McCormick would sometimes remind the cops arresting the bad guys at the end of the episode that they had to read it from the card, for it to count.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>. Frasier believes that he cannot commit perjury for Niles's sake, and has a discussion with Martin about it. Martin brings up an example where he did not read a criminal's rights. Said criminal had been arrested multiple times, and knew his rights as well as Martin did. This was an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">Hollywood Law</a>, though, as Martin said he <em>saw</em> the suspect shoot someone, and thus wasn't going to interrogate him—it was unnecessary. Plus, the only reason he didn't read them anyway is because the suspect got loose and he had to go catch him.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em> featured Booth arresting and Mirandizing a suspect in a hurry, since he's on an international airplane that's seconds from landing...and once it touches down, Booth doesn't have jurisdiction. Of course, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">patently ridiculous</a>. <em>Miranda</em> warnings are not necessary for a valid arrest; they are concerned with statements by the arrested suspect. "You're under arrest" would have been enough for jurisdictional purposes, with the <em>Miranda</em> warnings coming at Booth's leisure...if international jurisdiction worked like that anyway, which it (probably) doesn't.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em> this crosses with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingToThePerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingToThePerp">Lying to the Perp</a>. Beckett and Castle both insist that Beckett did not read a small time crook his rights and that he is free to go. The real ruse works in that they aren't after him, but his boss, who would see him walk out of the precinct (with suspicious ease) and assume he was working with the cops. The crooks only chance at survival is to implicate himself further so that the cops would arrest him, and thus keep him in custody.

Since Fraser's whole reason for arresting him in the consulate is to force the Chicago police to extradite him from Canada, you'd think he'd at least make the effort of using <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_rights#Canada">the Canadian version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingYourRights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingYourRights">Reading Your Rights</a>.

<ul><li> Ernesto Miranda, the defendant who went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and won, ended up serving the exact same sentence. The Supreme Court ruled that, because he had not been made aware of his right to not answer questions, his confession was not admissible, and the prosecution wasn't allowed to bring it up. However, the Court didn't simply let Miranda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">Off on a Technicality</a>: they sent the case back for a new trial. Prosecutors retried him, didn't bring up the confession, and got the same verdict.
<ul><li> Tragically or hilariously, depending your disposition, Miranda was paroled only to be stabbed to death shortly after in a bar fight. His murderer was probably confused when he was handed a card (more popular initially than speaking the rights) with his victim's name on it.
</li></ul></li><li> More recently, the Supreme Court has now found that this trope brings out its own existence. In <em>Dickerson v. United States</em>, the Court ruled: "We do not think there is such justification for overruling <em>Miranda</em>. <em>Miranda</em> has become embedded in routine police practice to the point where the warnings have become part of our national culture."
</li><li> Unfortunately, despite the original intent of the <em>Miranda</em> decision (to eliminate shady-but-technically-legal police practices <em>circa</em> 1966), the result of the decision has been the standardization of the <em>Miranda</em> warning as part of official police procedure, followed by the adoption of many techniques that don't actually violate the <em>letter</em> of the law, but do undermine its <em>spirit</em>. The "photocopier lie detector" trick, for example, in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em>, doesn't run afoul of the doctrine of <em>Miranda</em>, but is a good example of what the decision was intended to stop. (There's debate about whether that one occurred, but similar methods have developed in police stations across the country.) Additionally, people who are arrested rarely <em>bother</em> to remain silent, and besides, the Supreme Court has scaled back the boundaries of what <em>Miranda</em> means in the forty years since handing down the decision. In the end, <em>Miranda</em> doesn't really interfere with police investigations as much as you might think.
<ul><li> As the original book <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em> points out, <em>Miranda</em> is essentially a compromise between a court system that wants to see the rights of the accused protected, and a society that wants to see crimes punished (because confessions are, by and large, the most effective vehicle for that).
</li></ul></li><li> A good rule for anyone who encounters the police is that if the police <em>ask</em> you if they can do something, that means they <em>cannot</em> do it without your permission. If they don't need your permission, they aren't going to bother asking for it. No police officer <em>ever</em> asked someone for permission to arrest them. "Can I search your car?" or "you mind if I take a look in your car? You've got nothing to hide, right?" are ways that the police try to get around this without violating your rights, because if you gave them permission to search your person, your house, or your vehicle and they do find something, you are under arrest and it's perfectly legal because they had your <em>permission.</em> If a police officer <em>asks</em> to search you or your car or asks if he can talk to you, the smart thing to say is "am I being detained?" If they answer no, then tell them they do not have your permission and you are leaving. They can't stop you without arresting you. If they do arrest you, then you have the right to remain silent and you don't have to say anything. Also remember that if a police officer asks to search you or your vehicle or your house and you are not under arrest, if you say no, they cannot say "well, I'm searching anyway." THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, AND THE POLICE DO IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY WILL OFTEN GET AWAY WITH IT. Do not resist, but keep repeating that you do not give your permission, record everything on your phone if you can, and tell anyone nearby that you are being searched without your permission and would like them to stick around to get their name and phone number. If they do find something and arrest you, you will need all the witnesses you can get because anything found under those conditions is inadmissible. There is a clip online of a police officer telling men that he had pulled over that if they do not cooperate, he will just "make something up" and have them put away in jail for the rest of their lives. He boldly stated that THE POLICE DO THIS ALL THE TIME, and it's true. There are <em>thousands</em> of innocent men behind bars because of this.
<ul><li> To temper this somewhat, if you don't actually feel like you're in legal jeopardy, you really do have nothing to hide, and <em>know</em> for certain that there is nothing incriminating on you, your person, or the property under your control, there's no point being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic">a dick about it</a>. Although there certainly are bad police officers, most officers are just trying to get to the bottom of something that happened nearby. Immediately invoking rights will escalate the officer's suspicion of you,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note47z0d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note47z0d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note47z0d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Why don't you want me to look in there? Afraid of what I might find?"</span> in part reflecting the old saying: "Criminals know their rights better than their wrongs." Instead, just be friendly, don't bother explicitly saying no, and say verbally what's there ("All I've got in my trunk is a spare tire and my emergency kit"). You'll probably be let go without further incident; if not, you can escalate as needed. The moment you sense you're in legal jeopardy, though, you probably <em>are</em>, and should invoke every right at your disposal.
<ul><li> In any case, there are two important things to note here:
</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ol start="1"><li> <em>Miranda</em> covers interrogations and legal representation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsNotThatTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsNotThatTrope">not arrests or searches</a> (that's under the Fourth Amendment and interpretations thereof).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLawyersAdvisedThisTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLawyersAdvisedThisTrope">TVTropes is not intended as a source of legal advice; it is for entertainment purposes only.</a></li></ol><ul><li> In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a>, the <em>Miranda</em> rights (and other American legal tropes) are so ubiquitous in the media that Canadians (who have a significantly different legal system) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis">often expect to be handled like they would in the U.S.</a> For example, the fifth amendment to the Constitution of Canada had nothing to do with rights. It allowed the federal government to provide a bridge between Prince Edward Island and the mainland rather than ferry services. Protection against self-incrimination is found in Section 13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Canadian caution reads (with some variation depending on the police service):
<div class="indent"> <em>"You are under arrest for [charge], do you understand? You have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. We will provide you with a toll-free telephone lawyer referral service, if you do not have your own lawyer. Anything you say can be used in court as evidence. Do you understand? Would you like to speak to a lawyer?"</em>
</div><ul><li> It's not helped by TV shows explicitly set in Canada which nonetheless feature cops reading arrestees their rights American-style. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ForeverKnight">Forever Knight</a></em>, set in Toronto, has the hero's partner cuffing a guy, starting the "You have the right to remain silent" bit, and actually telling the guy "Sing along, you know the words!" (Canadian rights are, however, similar to American rights in regards to self-incrimination and legal representation. They're just not codified the same way as <em>Miranda</em>. The main significant differences: you do <em>not</em> have the right to have an attorney present while being questioned. If you ask for an attorney right away, the police have to hold off questioning you until you talk to one for advice, but you cannot say that they can't talk to you without your attorney being present. Also, invoking your right to silence doesn't mean the interrogation is over; you don't have to say anything, but the police don't have to stop asking you questions.)
</li></ul></li><li> In France, it is mandatory to read their rights to arrested suspects. This is never done. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCulturalOsmosis">Pop-Cultural Osmosis</a> often causes French suspects to insist on rights they don't actually have, however.
</li><li> Rather amusingly, and due to the subtitles (Closed Captioning) being prepared by an American company, the UK Fly-on-the-Wall Documentary <em>Police Interceptors</em> has the caption "Recites Miranda" whenever one of the police officers tell a suspect "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNotHaveToSayAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDoNotHaveToSayAnything">You Do Not Have to Say Anything</a>".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NealStephenson">Neal Stephenson</a> in <em>In The Beginning Was The Command Line</em>:
<div class="indent"> "We seem much more comfortable with propagating those values to future generations nonverbally, through a process of being steeped in media. Apparently this actually works to some degree, for police in many lands are now complaining that local arrestees are insisting on having their Miranda rights read to them, just like perps in American TV cop shows. When it's explained to them that they are in a different country, where those rights do not exist, they become outraged. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarskyAndHutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarskyAndHutch">Starsky &amp; Hutch</a> reruns, dubbed into diverse languages, may turn out, in the long run, to be a greater force for human rights than the Declaration of Independence."
</div></li><li> There was much debate (and backlash from some who believed it was akin to denying him them) when Boston police questioned Dzokhar Tsarnaev about the Boston Marathon bombing without being read his rights. Police justified this under the "public safety" exception, though a judge did Mirandize him eventually (and he shut up after he was).
<ul><li> Note that this is almost exactly the hypothetical "mad bomber" scenario described at the top of the page.
