<p>In a nutshell: <em>the world of a fictional universe isn't fixed beyond what the author has revealed to the reader</em>.
</p><p>So, to keep the plot on the rails, the author can subtly tweak facts the audience hasn't discovered yet. Improvisation masquerading as planning, if you will. For obvious reasons, this kind of plot event is pretty much impossible unless the work in question is either interactive or serialised.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>In the former case, the advantage to this trope is obvious  a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGame">Tabletop Game</a> could be badly hamstrung by a player anticipating the general direction of the campaign and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">prepared for anything</a>. The subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> this trope provides is essential to keeping things interesting. Likewise, if it's necessary for the plot in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a> to have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> meet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> early on but they're technically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">free to go anywhere they want</a>, this trope is essential to keeping the plot together.
</p><p>The trope has also become increasingly important in more traditional fiction as of late because the Internet's technological revolution is such that an author's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieTwistList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieTwistList">twists</a>" could easily be predicted ahead of time if enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">clever fans</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife">put their heads together</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">talk things over</a>. (And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">over</a>.) Catching wind of this, an author might then avoid being predicted by "coalescing" Schrödinger's Gun into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickTwist">sniper rifle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackTwist">uzi</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessVillainVictory">rocket launcher</a> as the situation requires. Since these cases involve more conscious improvisation, readers are more likely to consider the possibility that the writer doesn't actually know what they're doing and is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">jerking them around</a>, if not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">making it up entirely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">as they go along</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In interactive media such as video games, this trope can take the form of setting details retroactively warping themselves around the player's choices in ways that cannot be logically caused by the player character's in-universe choice  for example, when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">real location</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">an artifact</a> you seek throughout the campaign is dependent on the order in which you visit its possible locations. In effect, your choices in the game affect not where you end up, but <em>where you began</em>.
</p><p>A helpful way to look at this is how sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteryFiction">Mystery Fiction</a> authors will constantly feed the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">"clues"</a> supposedly narrowing down the possible suspects, only to select the "right" clue as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">Chekhov's Gunman</a> by the denouement and fit the facts around it. Similarly, in movies it is common practice to write most of the story  and only then pick the ending that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FocusGroupEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FocusGroupEnding">resonates the best with the test audience.</a>
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Also known as "Railschroding" (forgive the pun) because it can easily be used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">Railroading</a> purposes.

After fans figured it out too soon, DC changed the story, and the Monarch wound up being a different superhero entirely. (However, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">latest</a></em> Monarch, villain of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CountdownToFinalCrisis">Countdown to Final Crisis</a></em>, actually <em>was</em> Captain Atom (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">but he got better</a>). You couldn't make this stuff up.)
</li><li> And it happened again at DC when they were publishing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em>. The character Booster Gold and his robot buddy Skeets are from the future. In the first few issues, Skeets' records of current events become incorrect, which makes Booster suspect another time traveler is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeWrongWhatOnceWentRight">trying to alter history</a>. Writer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> balked at this, saying that the "fix the future" storyline had been done before. The editor would only allow him to change it if he could come up with an alternate explanation for Skeets' behavior. Morrison's response: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Because... he's evil?"</span> — which wound up completely changing Booster's storyline and others in the series.
</li><li> The infamous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> <em>Clone Saga</em> features Peter and Ben as "Schrodinger's clones": Ben was supposed to be the clone, but once the character became more popular, editors decided Peter was the clone...which lead to some backlash since Peter is the <em>main character</em>. As the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">story grew more complex</a>, writers had no idea who was supposed to be the original and who was supposed to be the clone. One idea even posited that they were both the original: At the end of the story, Peter would be sent back in time in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>, and believe himself to be Ben. It was only when Ben died that it became clear he was the clone "all along".

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc">Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</a></em> fanfic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HopeOnADistantMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HopeOnADistantMountain">Hope On A Distant Mountain</a></em>, the events of the visual novel turn out to be a virtual simulation. One of the programmers supervising Naegi's sim exploited this by changing the identity of the Mastermind before it was ever revealed. When asked why, he proclaimed that this made a better <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist">Plot Twist</a>, as their original choice seemed 'too obvious'.
</li><li> This is the difference between a divergent-timeline fic based on "Supposing this happened in the fictional universe?" and one based on "Supposing the writers decided to do this?"

In the latter case, <em>Enterprise</em> hasn't been written yet, so you can contradict anything you like; when (or if) <em>Enterprise</em> is created in your universe, it'll tie in to that canon.

There'll at the very least be a major choice near the beginning that divides the book in half (say, try to give the magic book back or try to hide it), and the entire setup, the very nature of the situation you're in, will be completely different depending on which you choose. Then other decisions will cause the same thing to happen on a smaller scale. Worst, often there'll be a situation in which you have a single decision where both lead to a quick death and an unhappy end, but the nature of what was putting you in danger is not the same depending on which you pick.
<ul><li> <em>All-Day Nightmare</em> starts with you and a boy called Max waking up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Amnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Amnesia">amnesia</a> in an old creepy house.

<ul><li> Each season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> has lots of shots of various characters giving significant looks and suspicious glances, so when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> is revealed, no matter who it is the audience has already been given a lot of seemingly suspicious behavior to justify it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>:
<ul><li> During production, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JMichaelStraczynski">J. Michael Straczynski</a> planned the <em>B5</em> plot out for a 5-year arc. However, he also made plans for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>. Indeed, the show didn't even end as he had originally meant for it to end, due to changing station commanders between seasons 1 and 2, changing several major plot points. And if you were just watching the show, you probably wouldn't have noticed (much).
</li><li> One particular noteworthy instance of a double-Schrödinger for the same plotline. Lyta Alexander was introduced in the pilot as a telepath who got to see and have mental contact with a Vorlon, thus establishing her connection with them and providing possible material for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">leveling her up later</a>. However, because the actress had other obligations Lyta didn't make it to the first season. Instead, Talia Winters was introduced, also a telepath. And she was also given a plot arc that actually began the process of leveling her up. Then, the actress playing her proved too much of a prima donna (and went through a nasty divorce from Garibaldi's actor), so she left. But they got Lyta's actress back, so they just went on and did what was originally intended. There was also a setup in place in case they needed to bring Talia back (Kosh backed up her brain), but it never went anywhere.
</li><li> The obvious actor/role substitutions: Jeffrey Sinclair/John Sheridan; Carolyn Sykes/Catherine Sakai/Anna Sheridan; Laurel Takashima/Ivanova/Lockley. Minor aversion with Ivanova, as she wasn't a straight substitution. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Originally, Takashima was a traitor. Instead, it's Garibaldi's aide.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is this was done because JMS let slip that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Takashima would have become a traitor.</span> So instead he gave that to someone else, and tossed in the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> regarding Ivanova for those who thought she was a straight substitution as subtle misdirection.

<ul><li> The "Helo on Caprica" plot in the first season was like this. Favorable fan reaction to Helo upgraded him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MauveShirt">Mauve Shirt</a>, and a new plot was born. It's actually evolved to the point of being an entire series long affair, which in retrospect the writers may have never considered until the miniseries was over and done with.
</li><li> Likewise the final five Cylons, when revealed, are practically Schrödinger's Hit-squad. All were perfectly plausibly human until the revelation, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tyrol even went through an "Am I a Cylon?" existential crisis and was told by an existing Cylon that he wasn't!</span> But after the revelation, things still fit with them being Cylons, especially as certain things assumed to be the case about them, but never outright stated, turned out to be incorrect. The series kept its word that "anyone can be a Cylon."

After his death and cremation in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E13LastOfTheTimeLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS29E13LastOfTheTimeLords">"Last of the Time Lords"</a>, an unidentified hand reaches in and takes a ring he wears. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> had no long-term plan for this, and did not assign the hand to anyone in particular. It was meant as a hook for whoever wanted to bring the Master back next.

</li><li> In turn, Moffat has said in interviews that he does this all the time  it looks like he's got this masterplan where everything fits together, sometimes over years, but only because no-one notices all the things he <em>didn't</em> get back to. River Song is a partial exception; she was initially made up just for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E8SilenceInTheLibrary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E8SilenceInTheLibrary">"Silence in the Library"</a> (and named for a cheap gag where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingTitle">Working Title</a> was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">A River Song Ending</a>"), but he had her story basically worked out by her second appearance.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A campaign example for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokethulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokethulhu">Pokéthulhu</a></em> involves the players "choosing between four houses for shelter". The book explicitly says that no matter which house the party chooses, it will be the one which contains the plot devices.
</li><li> <em>FATE</em>:
<ul><li> One character creation option is for players to begin with an essentially "blank" character sheet and fill in their skill proficiencies as the play progresses. For example, if a character is stuck behind a locked door, the player can declare that his character has the lockpicking skill and fill it in in one of his skill slots. The <em>FATE</em>-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">Dresden Files RPG</a> specifically allows this whether or not the character has already rolled the skill at a baseline level, both because there can be in-story reasons to hide their skill and because it's more fun not to have to worry about it.
</li><li> <em>FATE Core</em> allows players to spend a Fate Point to "declare a story detail" to their advantage, like saying they retroactively brought a piece of equipment or that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyAlwaysKnewThat">Suddenly Always Knew</a> useful information.
</li></ul></li><li> The "Gizmo" advantage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em>. This advantage allows the player to be carrying around an unspecified "gizmo", which he may at any time "pull out" and declare it to be whatever device he wants it to be (that he could have reasonably possessed). Additionally, the gizmo does not "enter play" until activated, so it cannot be damaged, lost, stolen, or uncovered in a search.
<ul><li> The same is true in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Toon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Toon">Toon</a></em> — Steve Jackson games love this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> This is essentially how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BurningWheel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BurningWheel">Burning Wheel</a></em> works: If you say that you want to kick a bowl of fruit into the guard's face to create a distraction, then there will be a bowl of fruit right there for you to kick. It wasn't there until you said it was. Essentially, the players all have Schrödinger's Gun, to an extent.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HousesOfTheBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HousesOfTheBlooded">Houses of the Blooded</a></em> is similar. When a player rolls for something, it's generally the right to decide things about the scene or how actions turn out. The rules explicitly state that you can decide pretty much anything that hasn't specifically been established yet.
<ul><li> There are several other games which allow the players to retroactively decide minor aspects of the current scene, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FengShui">Feng Shui</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Adventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Adventure">Adventure</a>!</em> handles this with a game mechanic: players can spend points to perform a Dramatic Edit and declare that there is e.g. a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlySpaciousSewer">convenient manhole cover</a> in the blind alley they've run down. This is great when the players <em>only</em> need to use it to collaboratively make situations more awesome, but less great when, as it sometimes does, it becomes a sort of ablative defense against railroading (why would the GM decide it was a blind alley in the first place?).
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Wushu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Wushu">Wushu</a></em>, everything happens exactly as the players describe it. Additionally, the more complicated and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">dramatic</a> a description is, the more dice the players receive, providing massive incentive to weave complicated and dramatic descriptions. To prevent complete insanity, actions can be vetoed by another player or the GM, and there's generally a "pool limit" maximum dice cap.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Nobilis">Nobilis</a></em> has The Monarda Law, which states that the answer to a PC's question should almost never be a flat-out "no". Additionally, in that game, prophecies explicitly work by the GM throwing out a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCreamKoan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceCreamKoan">meaningless</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">symbolism</a> — when the PCs offer a plausible explanation, it is assumed to be true, and any action they take on it gains a bonus.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The John Tynes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CallOfCthulhu">Call of Cthulhu</a> scenario <em>In Media Res</em> uses a very similar device: You're given a whole heap of weird symbolism to throw at the players, and whatever they decide it means, it means.</span>
</li><li> And really, the whole idea of it is a pretty common <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> trick: Throw out an ambiguous scenario with a lot of plot hooks, see which one the players respond to, and run with it like it's the baton at a relay.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> and its modern cousin <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em> both rely on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Stunting system</a>. Do it with style, and even if it is utterly ludicrous, it's more likely to succeed than if done boringly. For the most part, "stunts" involve pieces of the environment that the players make up as they go along. Asking if something exists in the scene should be met with "It does now."
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DCHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DCHeroes">DC Heroes</a></em> had a similar feature. A PC may spend a few of his/her Hero Points to decree the existence of specific objects in his vicinity, if the GM agrees to allow them.
<ul><li> Then there's the Omni-Gadgets. "Whaddya know, this 8 AP Omni-Gadget in my belt is a Force Field generator!".
</li><li> In the next edition they added the Omni-Connection advantage. "Paradyne Technologies? What luck, an old buddy of mine from college is the VP of Marketing there!".
</li></ul></li><li> It is explicitly written into the rules of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> that anything the GM says goes. <em>Anything</em>. The GM is perfectly free to roll a 5 and declare it a 17. Similarly, players may discover that they had mutations they were unaware of, that the NPC they're assigned to kill suddenly belongs to their secret society now, or that their weapon was actually sabotaged by Communists, or that while they were fleeing from a renegade robot they caused an Ultraviolet citizen a twenty minute delay in his routine. If it doesn't contradict established fact, or if the GM can invent a justification for why it doesn't, then it's all good. (Although, considering that this is <em>Paranoia</em>, contradicting established fact is perfectly acceptable behavior.)
</li><li> In the new Czech RPG Střepy snů (<em>Dreamshards</em>), this is a mechanic given to the players — if you want to have done something in the past that could help you in the current situation (or if you simply want something to be a certain way), you can burn one of your dream points and it's part of the game now. Hiding in a basement and the only way out is besieged by zombies? One dream point later, you can leave through the secret door (that you most certainly installed) into the tunnels below.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury">Spirit of the Century</a></em> is fond of this one. The languages that a character knows need not be specified at creation. A character can spend "Fate Points" in order to make declarations about the scene in their favor or create weird coincidences (e.g. "I declare that the guard holding us hostage was my college roommate"). Players can use knowledge skills to make similar declarations (so an expert in architecture can "create" a secret passage in a building by declaring that he or she learned such in his or her research). Furthermore, numerous stunts allow for Schrödinger's Gun situations, like Universal Gadget, which once per session lets the player create a better-than-off-the-shelf custom item on the spot and introduce it into the game just just when he or she needs it (the character may have had it all along or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">simply be really good at improvisation</a>), or Master of Disguise, which allows a character to effectively stop playing, then later declare that any unimportant character "is really <em>me</em> in disguise!" The game also gives rules for on the fly character creation, which works similar to the <em>FATE</em> example above — unsurprisingly, as it's based on another version of the same system.
</li><li> <em>Swashbucklers of the 7 Skies</em> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ProseDescriptiveQualities">PDQ</a> system games are fond of this one - there's usually a power currency (Style Dice, Hero Points) to let the players declare significant facts about the game, such as inventing useful NPCs or giving them new abilities. S7S even encourages players to make flat statements that something exists and tossing a Style Die down, as opposed to asking if it's so and having to pay the cost the GM sets (though the GM should ask for more dice on particularly large changes anyway).
<ul><li> PDQ2 rules game <em>Vox</em> has a starting scenario to run character creation similar to a FATE game, where you choose what you can do as you need to do it until all your abilities are set.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Champions">Pulp Hero</a></em> has "floating perquisites" such as Floating Contacts and Floating Favors that a character can buy and leave undefined when they are purchased during character construction. These Contacts and Favors represent a character who is so widely traveled he potentially has friends who owe him favors <em>everywhere in the world</em>. The player can define who these Contacts are whenever he feels the need to call on one. Once the player uses them, though, they become regularly defined Contacts and Favors.

When Jojora asks the Mario Bros. which of her friends should come (and beat the crap out of them, presumably), the player is given the choice of four different names, which seem to refer to four different possible enemies. However, no matter which one you pick, Jojora's friend will look and fight exactly the same.

This prevents a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">medium-aware</a> player from saving the game early, finding out the code, loading the saved game, and then opening the lock much earlier in the game, which would have required the designers to come up with a completely different ending.

Your answers will determine whether you go down the A or B paths. Only the first of these missions qualifies as a Schrödinger's Gun, as the opposite mission on the other end of the "coin flip" is explicitly referenced as having happened concurrent with the chosen mission, only carried out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroOfAnotherStory">another fighter squadron</a>.

</li><li> Both games also include an optional series of Dead Drops that flesh out the story. Their locations are fixed, but no matter what order you visit them in, you'll always find the first Dead Drop at the first site you visit, the second at the second, and so on. This means the story itself will always make sense, but where you <em>find</em> it may not. (For instance, some of John's messages are recorded during the part of the story where travel between the three boroughs is difficult or impossible, but if you wait till late in the game to pick them up, they may be scattered all over town.)

No matter what order he opens the actual bags in, the result is always the same. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> His dad's body, his mother's body, and then Scarecrow.</span> Also, no matter what order you collect the audio logs in, they are always the next in the set, as are the Spirit of Arkham messages.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a></em>, when Batman manages to corner Scarecrow aboard the airship, he starts hallucinating two different Scarecrows along with the Joker telling him to "Pick the real Scarecrow!" No matter which Scarecrow you choose, right or left, it's always the wrong one and the real Scarecrow douses you with another dose of his fear toxin. Conveniently, the game also disables all of Batman's techniques that would allow him to attack both Scarecrows at once, preventing you from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAThirdOption">Taking A Third Option</a>.
</li><li> An experience while playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DejaVu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DejaVu">Déjà Vu</a></em> seemed like a literal Schrödinger's Gun: trying to shoot the gun-toting mugger resulted in him firing first for a game over. Restarting and giving in to his demands the next time around let him escape while claiming that the gun wasn't even loaded. Of course, that could just be the mugger kicking you when you're down.

Even if you meet a bunch of elves defending themself against some darkspawn in the far northwest near the dwarven home, while the elven woods are southeast and the darkspawn isn't actually rare on the surface that far north.
</li><li> The origin stories always end with Duncan bailing your ass out of trouble, which every origin you choose will be the place Duncan decided to recruit a new Grey Warden. It is implied if you go back to those places as a different origin that what happened happened but without Duncan saving that would-be hero. The Dwarven Noble, the second child of King Endrin, was framed for murdering his brother and killed on the Deep Roads; the Dwarven Commoner died in jail, refusing to eat; the human noble was killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimCurry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimCurry">Tim Curry</a>, etc.

<ul><li> Schematics for elemental runes (Fire, Frost, etc.) are found as ancient glyphs on the walls in various locations, only readable using Veilfire. Each element has 3 levels of runes: normal (no prefix), Master and Superb, and therefore may be found in 3 different locations. However, you cannot find the higher-level runes before you have found the lower-level ones. In a normal playthrough you are supposed to find the Fire Rune in The Hinterlands (the lowest-level area), the Master Fire Rune in The Western Approach (a middle-level area) and the Superb Fire Rune in The Hissing Wastes (the highest-level area). Yet if you choose to ignore the glyphs in the lower-level areas you may change or even reverse the order (i.e. the content of the ancient glyphs in all locations is in fact decided by the order in which you choose to read them).

At the end of <em>The King of Fighters '96</em>, Chizuru reveals that she lured your team there because she needed the help of those responsible for defeating Rugal. In both cases, this speech is made regardless of which team you are playing, and whether or not they actually won or were even in the previous game. (Aside from Geese/Wolfgang/Big, whom even she refuses to acknowledge.) This is additionally in spite of both victories over Rugal in canon being attributed to Kyo Kusanagi (his win in <em>'94</em> is even <a class="urllink" href="http://kofaniv.snkplaymore.co.jp/english/history/kof95_story/index.php">specifically noted on SNKP's official website chronicling the series' history<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), who'd go on to win the <em>'96</em> and <em>'97</em> tourneys.
</li><li> A quest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> requires the player to help the prince find a gift for his beloved. There are three items you can show him; the first two will always be rejected, no matter the order you try them in. An alternative option is to find only one of the items and hand it directly to the birthday girl, who gets pissed that the prince hired someone else to choose a gift for her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> makes extensive use of this trope, from personal storylines (which affect instances) to dynamic events (which alters the state of the world players share).

The games also include a Schrödinger area of the game map: at a certain point in the game, you can earn a flute that will eventually allow you to summon one of the three animal companions. Each of them have skills that allow you to reach places Link can't reach alone, and depending on which flute you get, part of the map ends up being an area that requires that companion to get through. (If you go to that area <em>before</em> getting a flute, the game forces the choice for you.)

There's only one lamp; the second and third chests are backups for the first one in case you somehow didn't notice it; so, the lamp will magically appear in whichever chest you open first (if you open the other two, you find only 5 Rupees).

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first two games have an instance of this in the opening scene. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em>, regardless of what Shepard's background and military reputation are, he or she is the <em>perfect</em> candidate for the first human Spectre. Likewise, when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> begins, regardless of whether the imported save file flags the council as saved, lost, or lost and replaced with an all-human council, Shepard "did everything right."
</li><li> If the player imported a <em>Mass Effect</em> save into <em>ME2</em>, Shepard is given a brief debriefing and then, as a "memory test", is asked which of two characters he or she chose to represent humanity on the Galactic Council. Because that decision wasn't saved in <em>ME1</em> (the final save file is created before the decision occurs), either choice is considered correct and will determine which of the two is the Council member later in the game.
</li><li> <em>Mass Effect</em> has a few moments where your two squadmates will disagree on the big decision you are about to make. However, their opinions can sometimes change depending on the other squadmate so that there will always be one in favor of each option. Thus, some squadmates will be in favor of saving the council, but if a different character is present they might instead be in favor of letting them die. This is presumably to make it clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BothSidesHaveAPoint">Both Sides Have a Point</a> and avoid a scenario where two characters are egging you on with the same opinion.
</li><li> <em>Mass Effect 2</em> has you interact with Khalisah al-Jilani, who will try to frame your decision at the end of the last game (saving the council at the expense of human ships, or letting the council die) in the worst possible light, regardless of which you chose. This at least is fully in character, given that she's a paparazzi.
</li><li> <em>Mass Effect 3</em> reveals that all of 2's DLC missions happened whether or not you bought them, but the details changed without the PC on hand. Cerberus resorted to nuking Project Overlord, Liara needed a whole team of mercs to take on the Shadow Broker (and couldn't save Feron), and Arrival took a whole team of marines (none of whom survived).
</li><li> A more minor form in <em>Mass Effect 3</em>, on one side-mission, you are looking for someone and they are in one of two rooms on the presidium. They are always in the second one you go to, no matter which order you choose.
</li><li> The entirety of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em> is one giant Schrödinger's Gun dependent on which Ryder twin is chosen to be the player character at the start of game. If Scott Ryder is chosen by the player, then there is a malfunction in Sara Ryder's cryo pod that sidelines her for the majority of the game while Scott becomes the Pathfinder and explores the Heleus cluster, culminating in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sara being kidnapped by the Archon as a part of the final boss battle</span>. If Sara is chosen by the player, the game plays out functionally the same; Scott's pod malfunctions, he's sidelined while Sara becomes Pathfinder and explores Heleus without him and then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has to rescue him from the Archon during the final boss fight</span>.

When the second agent finds the first, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> orders her to shoot him preemptively. If you don't, he springs up as a vampire and kills the other agent. If you do, the vampire calls to taunt you with the fact that the agent was still human so you killed him needlessly.

To fix this, the programmers fixed it so that whichever portal you fire is the right one and it retroactively changes the portal you had already placed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XIII">XIII</a></em>, the player must enter a locked cabin to obtain a fuse. There are several guards in the area, but the last one who gets killed is always the one holding the key.

The original game plays this straight, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">remake</a> justifies it a little.

<ul><li> In the Colonists story arc, the climax is to either fight off the Protoss to try and see if the Zerg infection amongst the colonists can be arrested and perhaps cured, or to side with the Protoss and mercilessly burn out all of the infected. Your choice is always the correct one: Choose the former, and the game reveals that there were only a few infected colonists, who are easily contained, and Dr. Hanson leaves the ship to work on researching a cure. Choose the latter, the infestation is far more widespread, and Dr. Hanson goes insane and infects herself, turning into a monstrous human/zerg hybrid that Raynor has to kill.
</li><li> Meanwhile, in the Shadow Ops story arc, the climax involves Raynor siding either with Tosh or with Nova to, respectively, either free the fellow Specter program prisoners (supposedly too mentally unstable to release back into society) held at the New Folsom facility or stop them from getting free. Once again, your choice inevitably turns out to be the correct one: side with Tosh, and the Specter prisoners would turn out to be helpful, if somewhat eccentric victims of circumstances wrongfully kept in a hellish prison and more than willing to help once set free. Side with Nova, and it'd turn out that Tosh had been completely insane the whole time, and has not only already took over an orbital facility near the planet that now must be blown up lest it be turned into a Specter factory, but also experimenting on innocent civilians, turning them into (equally, murderously insane) Specters against their will.

This raises the question of exactly which of the dozen Haitians is the son you are trying to protect, as mechanically and graphically they are all identical. However, the mission is a failure only if ALL the Haitians die, which means that 11 of the 12 are "expendable", i.e. NOT the son you're supposed to protect. Thus one can conclude that the son will always be the final Haitian killed, regardless of the order in which the Haitians go down.

And, in both cases, you can search the houses in whatever order you want, but your target is always in the last one you search. It's less noticeable in the first case, as one of the safehouses is much further off than the rest of them are and getting between them isn't exactly easy, so you're likely to just naturally end up there last unless you go out of your way to visit it early.

It has actual gameplay implications, in that the only way to get the A and S-endings (where one of the other girls is still alive) is to actively avoid investigating strange noises or places where a body could be found, because if you do, the game will take the chance to declare one of your friends dead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></em> has this principle as the whole basis of its <a class="urllink" href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Radiant">Radiant system<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Many side quests will feature randomised aspects that are determined by which places the player has or hasn't visited yet, what other quests have already been completed, what level the character is at, etc. Some items or characters will appear in variable locations, based on e.g. where the Dragonborn happens to be when they reach a certain level. The trope appears in several other specific ways throughout the game:
<ul><li> The various shouts available to the Dragonborn normally are learned by visiting Word Walls dotting the landscape of Skyrim. However, the text of the word walls will change depending on which word in the shout you have, so you will never learn the second or third word in a shout without knowing the one before it.
</li><li> Two dragons that you must fight in the main quest do not have unique models. While they are semi-locked into specific Dragon forms, if you are high enough in level (possibly by putting off the main quest for quite a while) they can change into different species of dragons.
</li><li> In the opening sequence, the player can decide to flee the dragon attack either with a member of the Imperial Legion or with a Stormcloak. No matter which they go with, they will always find their escape route through the keep blocked by hostile members of the opposing faction.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> uses the same engine (Creation Engine) as <em>Skyrim</em> for good and for bad. The faction most likely to use and abuse Radiant Quests are the Minutemen where Preston tells you to go defend a Settlement/clear out a Settlement spot/deal with (feral ghouls/super mutants/raiders)/save somebody kidnapped/etc. While these quests are always there to help you level up they get really old really fast and some places are locked out from you until you reach a high enough level (such as having a lock/computer too difficult to unlock).
<ul><li> Later DLC for the game also makes some of the quests a little ridiculous... how did a small group of Raiders manage to kidnap your 15 foot tall Glowing Deathclaw, and get it into the bunker with the normal sized door? And why would it need rescuing from a group it would easily eat for lunch if they attacked the settlement it was part of?

There are more than three items that can be used for this quest, and depending on which ones you bring and in which order, the character's past (and his class) will be different.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, you are given the choice to either join the guard, or the thieves. If you join the guard, then they are heavily overwhelmed and many of the members are obviously corrupted, while the thieves are ridiculously powerful and pretty much rule the city. But if you join the thieves, then the guard ends up being quite strong, devoid of corruption, and very efficient, and quite a nuisance to the thieves' business. In some cases it's because the tasks of bribing guards and extorting merchants was delegated to you, but in a few quests towards the end of the storyline a number of guards are hostile to you no matter which side you're on.

They make their way through 3 sections, and in each of them you sit in a safe spot and must press one of two buttons that will determine their fate: one results in one of the adventurers dying, while the other drives one of them to insanity. In the second section, two of the remaining adventurers come across a tightly locked cage filled with riches. Your choice is either activating a fire trap that blasts them, or making hundreds of keys appear in the room. This trope into play with the orc adventurer's behaviour: even though the circumstances are exactly the same, depending on your choice, the orc makes a completely different decision. If you choose to release the fire trap, he will try to pry the cage's bars open moments before the trap activates. If you release the keys, he will instead be vary of the cage and decide that they should just go away, moments before the keys appear.

Since that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">obviously not going to happen</a>, selecting that option will cause a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">clone of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> to appear out of nowhere, easily kill you and your allies and</span> save Vader.

Which path Sophia will suggest is determined by how Indy solved the first puzzle of the game: Sweet-talking praising of Sophia to her backstage guard (Team), making his way through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlockPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlockPuzzle">maze of crates</a> into a fire exit (Wits), or knocking out the aforementioned guard in a fight (Fists).
</li><li> Applies in-universe to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myst">Myst</a></em> franchise: when a descriptive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PortalBook">Book</a> is written, it creates a link to a world which precisely matches the description, but any features not mentioned are up in the air. After the link is made, the writer can actually change the world by specifying new details, as long as they don't contradict anything that has yet been observed. If they do, the link will instead be changed to a different world which fits the new description.
</li><li> The final Splatfest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> (an event where players pick sides to battle) was a competition between the Squid Sisters, Callie and Marie, which Marie ended up winning.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the quest where you have to find Helena Pierce's audio logs, if you try to destroy the ice block on top of the house near a vending machine (the location of the second ECHO log) before the audio of the first ECHO log even finishes, the ice block will respawn, with a chance of spawning additional cash.
</li><li> During the quest where you have to collect Tannis's ECHO logs in Sanctuary, regardless of the order in which you retrieve the ECHO logs, the audio being played will still be in sequence as Tannis records her story from start to finish.

If you don't warn him, then he attempts to open the case, triggers the bomb, and dies. If you <em>do</em> warn him, then it turns out he already knew about the bomb and removed it earlier.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunlessSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SunlessSea">Sunless Sea</a></em>, Maybe's-Daughter's story arc is set up in such a way that it combines this with a degree of randomisation. When you start her arc, she presents you with a list of places you might be able to find her mother, and as someone who has played a videogame before, you assume it's going to be a straightforward example of this trope and she'll be in the last one you visit. Actually, the game does a randomised check when you hit the appropriate prompt in a place you haven't searched before, and she's in whichever one you're at when it succeeds - but since the odds start at 4% and double each time, she'll generally only pop up once you've checked most, but not all, of the places (which is just as well, really, since one of the locations is on the surface and so requires ferocious fuel expenditure and a minor risk of death to reach, and another is surrounded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Blue Prophets</a>, basically swarms of ship-killing death parrots).

If you try to use a lock pick to open it before you are supposed to it will only contain another box and a note saying not to try that again. If you lose the box the guy who gave it to you will say that he knew you were going to lose it and gave you a fake.

Papyrus, assuming you spared him, will call your cell phone once you reach a certain place in Waterfall and ask to confirm the clothing you're wearing, since a friend of his wants to know. Said friend turns out to be Undyne, who actually wants to kill you, which Papyrus strongly disagrees about. After your first encounter with Undyne, Papyrus calls again to explain his reaction to the prior phone conversation, revealing that no matter how you answered him, he gave Undyne an accurate physical description of you, despite his efforts to the contrary. If you told Papyrus the truth about what you were wearing, he assumed you were too smart to tell the truth and passed your "misdirection" on to Undyne verbatim. If you lied about your outfit (or changed clothes after the phone call), then Papyrus assumed you were telling him the truth, so he lied to Undyne on your behalf—and his lie just happened to match up with whatever you're actually wearing at that moment. (This information does not actually affect any of the player's encounters with Undyne.)

Additionally, in one story branch, whether or not you shoot the injured Sarah that another Sarah (who's trapped behind a jammed door) claims is the fake determines which one of them actually is the fake. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If you shoot the injured Sarah, the "Sarah" behind the door laughs at you being tricked into killing the real Sarah.

The result of this is that the two branches apparently occur in two slightly different universes, where prior events were different. If Florentine attends the meeting, the stated reason for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kant's dismissal</span> is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roland kept his prized possession for over a week</span>, which is corroborated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roland giving you said prized possession after the meeting</span>.

However, there <em>is</em> a coherent truth  but no one route ever shows it to you all at once. The apparent contradictory facts are just lies that didn't happen to get exposed in the path you took, and there will always be some such lies no matter which way you go.

Who is responsible for abducting Grace and their reasons for doing so vary depending on whose route you follow, as the antagonist always has a connection to the protagonist's chosen love interest.

Not only does the trope appear in that particular strip, but also in the writing process behind the strip. In the earlier draft of the comic, David Morgan-Mar kept flip-flopping on whether the punchline should reference Heisenberg or Schrödinger. He decided on Heisenberg and wrote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant">a long note below the comic</a>, explaining Heisenberg and the Uncertainty Principle, before realizing that Schrödinger worked better as a punchline and changing it.

When it looked like the New England Patriots would become the first NFL team to go 19-0 in a season, a number of merchants allowed customers to pre-order corresponding commemorative merchandise.

A subject is selected and sent out of the classroom while the other students ostensibly pick a person, place or thing that the subject must guess. The subject is brought back into the room and can pick students to ask a single question to each of them. After the 20 questions, whatever the subject's guess, they are told they are correct. At least, they should be "correct". The students in the class were actually instructed to not pick anything, and give any answer they like as long as it could be consistent with all previously answered questions for at least one thing.

Play continues with each player being allowed to play or challenge. If they play, they write an additional letter either in front of or after the previous letters.

This time, the middle row would either read "CLINTON ELECTED" or "ASSHOLE ELECTED".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1efis');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1efis" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1efis');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Clearly, the writer of this one didn't like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>.</span> As a bonus, because the Clinton in <em>this</em> election was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton">a woman</a>, there was another line that had some alternate answers — where the original 1996 crossword had "MISTER PRESIDENT", the revised grid had either "MADAME PRESIDENT" or "MADMAN PRESIDENT".
