</p><p>The answer is called Railroading: In short, the GM takes any measure necessary to ensure there is only one direction the campaign may proceed — <em>his</em> planned direction. This can manifest in any number of imaginable ways; some of them subtle, others ... not so much:
</p><p></p><ul><li> Planning out connecting geographic areas in a linear fashion, to ensure that there is only <em>one</em> given path from town A to town E (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom">there will simply be no sidepaths or other locations to explore</a>);

</li><li> Having random NPCs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCRoadblock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCRoadblock">remind the party</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">Continue Your Mission, Dammit!</a> (even if only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseDestinySaysSo">Because Destiny Says So</a>) if the players haven't left a town quickly enough;

</li></ul><p>...The list goes on and on, the exact possibilities limited only by the GM.
</p><p>In practice, the use of Railroading is generally regarded as one sign of a poor GM, as forcing the players down a single predetermined path (like cars on a railroad track, hence the name) runs against the collaborative nature of a tabletop RPG in the first place, where every player is allowed an equal voice in dictating what happens next. If players discover the Railroading and rebel against it, they are going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a>. (And if going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a> triggers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies</a>, then something about the campaign has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">failed on a fundamental level</a>.)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>On the other hand, while complaints of Railroading are directed primarily at difficult or unimaginative GMs, there are also difficult and unimaginative <em>players</em> for whom a swift kick in the caboose might be the <em>only</em> way to get them to do something even as simple as leaving the tavern in the first town (or immediately coming straight back to it). A subtle GM who knows his players and makes an effort to maintain at least an illusion of free will and exploration, and really <em>does</em> make stories that are That Damned Good, can probably get away with herding a few cats. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Console and PC RPGs</a>, which by their very nature are predetermined stories, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">do this all the time</a>.)
</p><p>And plus, maybe the story is just worth going on the railroad for. Players may not object to railroading if the story's good enough to excuse the lack of perceived freedom, or if the ride is fun enough. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">Tropes Are Tools</a> after all — it's been pointed out that you have to be somewhat linear to actually make a story work.
</p><p>In a similar vein, an occasional Railroading can do wonders to kick-start the campaign should players have run out of steam and be left with absolutely <em>no</em> idea how they should proceed next; a GM pointing the players down the nearest track and hoping they can play it can get the campaign moving again, to the benefit of everyone involved. Experienced GMs know when it is (and is <em>not</em>) appropriate to Railroad the campaign — a good measure is that if the players are currently having fun, there's probably no need to interfere.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersGun">Schrödinger's Gun</a> can also be a useful tool for a subtle GM to silently railroad players without their awareness. If the GM spent a lot of time secretly preparing a dungeon to the North of the current town, but the players suddenly decide to go South instead, the GM may be able to — surprise! — secretly decide that this dungeon was instead in the South all along, and the players reach it just as the GM planned anyway. This form of Railroading (sometimes dubbed "railschroding") can be an effective tool, as the players are the ones driving the 'train', unaware that the GM has already thrown all the switches so that it somehow ends up in the same place no matter which direction they take it. Essentially, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a> with the GM as fate.
</p><p>Of course, one advantage a GM always has over a console or PC RPG is that his players probably aren't going to restart the game from the beginning and realize he was leading them by the nose the entire time. (Note that for players or GMs who treat their tabletop game exactly like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">console RPG</a>, Railroading is 100% par for the course.)
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSidepathsNoExplorationNoFreedom">No Sidepaths, No Exploration, No Freedom</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a> analogues.
</p><p>Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a>, an attempt by the players to <em>escape</em> a GM's railroading, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox">Quicksand Box</a>, what happens when the GM gives too <em>little</em> direction. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlamedForBeingRailroaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlamedForBeingRailroaded">Blamed for Being Railroaded</a>, which is when the GM (or more commonly, the videogame) forces the players down a path and then shames them for "choosing" it; this is considered <em>particularly</em> bad form, and is likely to incite rebellion.
</p><p>Not to be confused with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailEnthusiast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailEnthusiast">Rail Enthusiast</a>'s favorite hobby, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailroadPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailroadPlot">Railroad Plot</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable">Knights of the Dinner Table</a></em>: B.A., the put-upon GM, engages in some blatant railroading in one strip. His group of players (besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Sara</a>) see going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a> as a point of honor and doing so a contest of wills between them and the GM. After getting some advice on how to keep the plot rolling, he starts in on his new adventure with a lord tasking the party with a quest. The players, of course, immediately try to mess with the lord by wandering off into the castle to steal his stuff. B.A puts the kibosh on that by having the court wizard teleport the party away by force onto a secluded path with mountains on one side and forests on the other. The battle begins. The party tries to go into the forest, but the woods are packed too close together to pass through. They try to cut down the trees or burn them, but for every one they destroy, another is just behind it with no end in sight. As for the mountains, they try to climb, but they secrete an oil that makes them too slick to scale. Using magic and equipment gets them to impassible outcroppings of jagged shards that cause damage. The battle of wills goes on for hours, with the players themselves feeling claustrophobic, until they finally give in. During a break, the players decide to sneak a peek behind the GM screen and see the map of the adventure: The path they're on is a literal straight line between the lord's castle and their destination, with the forests and mountains on each side explicitly labeled 'impassible'. The strip ends with B.A. being hung upside down from the ceiling for the aggravation.
<ul><li> Unfortunately for B.A., his players tend to assume that he's not only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGameMaster">Killer Game Master</a>, but the kind of guy who will put huge piles of treasure in the game world <em>just</em> to screw them out of finding it.

If every loop were a baseline loop, this wouldn't be much of an issue — however, baseline loops, while the most common type of loops, are not the only type of loop a Looper goes through. There are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> loops, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a> loops, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover">Crossover</a> loops, etc., where following baseline is literally impossible. If not remedied, Setsuna Syndrome can drive a looper insane, making them more and more desperate to maintain the baseline timeline, thus causing them to take extreme measures — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheWinxClubLoops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheWinxClubLoops">Helia blowing up Tecna's subspace pocket</a></span>. The only way to treat it is to convince the Looper that they don't have the power to stop the Loops so maintaining the baseline timeline is pointless.

Excited by the (to them) wonderful story they have set up, they can get flustered, irritated and downright stuck when their players either miss what they think are obvious markers on how to proceed next or just plain choose to do something the GM did not account for. While an experienced GM can subtly guide a party back on path, the novice often (and in-game wise illogically) ham-fistedly forces the players back on the "correct" path, either in story or fourth wall yelling/whining at the PCs.
</li><li> The gaming blog "The Alexandrian" gives excellent advice for averting railroading in tabletop RPGs, called <a class="urllink" href="http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule">the three clue rule<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: "For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues." This is because (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) "the PCs will probably miss the first; ignore the second; and misinterpret the third before making some incredible leap of logic that gets them where you wanted them to go all along."
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mekton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mekton">Mekton</a></em> adventure <em>Operation Rimfire</em> which read more like a script then an adventure. While it featured ten pre-generated player characters, five of them were pretty much useless. To make matters worse, two of the other characters (and one of the useless ones!) were indispensable to the plot, however, if the players didn't choose to play both of those characters, then important developments and revelations would be skipped or confined to NPC-only dialogue (And there is nothing less fun then watching the GM talk to themselves). The story leaves no room for deviation, basically forcing the players to do exactly what the script tells them, otherwise the plot simply will not advance. And finally, the worst straw is the villain's death: no matter what the players do, which pretty much amounts to ten people whaling on him at once with guns, rapiers and laser swords, he lives long enough to deliver his <em>twenty seven line</em> dying speech and then execute his master plan anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> is about playing mercenaries who are little fish in a big mess of secret wars between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Megacorps</a>, so naturally their missions are pretty scripted (and it's also perfectly normal for an irresistible force to point a very big gun at them to push them into an adventure). <em>Harlequin</em> then one-ups this by explicitly stating that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>, just in case the shadowrunners decide that they've had enough of his games and aggravation. Many printed adventures in early editions of the game had sections called "Picking Up The Pieces", which had specific advice to the game master on how to get things back on track when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> went off the rails. Even more than that, the players are essentially hired for jobs offered by their fixer (contact). While in theory, the fixer should have a number of jobs available to offer to the players, in practice, the fixer usually has <em>one</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia">Paranoia</a></em> is an interesting case, in that the point of the game is usually gleeful chaotic backstabbing, but the <em>setting</em> of an underground complex ruled by an all-powerful computer allows for some pretty iron-clad railroading if the GM so desires it.

Most of the time the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> could only do one thing due to the situation, and several times the Dungeon Master was specifically told by the module to take action to force the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> along a pre-determined path. There were also dire results for the whole game world if the players did manage to avoid doing exactly what they were supposed to. For instance, there was a specific action in the first module which, if nobody did it, resulted in there <em>never being any priests</em>.
</li><li> The notorious WG7 <em>Castle Greyhawk</em>, a blatant joke module, teaches the DM how to properly lure players to adventure:
<div class="indent">Culum's goal is to get the adventurers to go down into the dungeon. To this end, he'll continually use phrases like "presumed dead," and "assume the worst," in an attempt to get the characters to volunteer to search the dungeon for his dad. If that doesn't work, Culum pathetically offers them his one battered copper, (actually he has 15 silver stashed in his boot) to look for dad. If the adventurers still won't go to rescue dear dad then Culum will flat out ask them. Continued refusal means that you have no adventure this evening — close the book, fold up the screen, and stare at your players until they get the hint.
</div></li><li> A number of adventures for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> setting start with the Mists of Ravenloft suddenly appearing around a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> and carrying them off to that demiplane without any chance to avoid it. The adventure RQ3 <em>From the Shadows</em> takes the railroading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> are approached by a man who asks them to find and defeat a Headless Horseman. If they agree, when they confront the Headless Horseman the Mists appear and take them to Ravenloft. If they refuse, the man casts a Vistani curse on them and the next time they're on a road alone the Mists appear and carry them off. Once they're in Ravenloft the DM (Dungeon Master) is ordered to kill each of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a>, either by having the Headless Horseman cut off their heads or having them be slaughtered by subsequent waves of monsters, including three beholders (!). The DM is told to cheat on die rolls if necessary to kill off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a>. A short time later the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> are brought back to life (sort of) by the lich Azalin and are forced to perform missions for him (if they don't they're permanently killed). If they agree to a mission they'll probably end up being all killed <em>again</em> (but not for real). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> are very unlikely to gain any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> from performing these missions and can possibly lose tens of thousands of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> while doing so through no fault of their own.
</li><li> In <em>Egg of the Phoenix</em>, after the adventure is over, the titan Sylla suggests that the PCs let her take the Egg <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMacguffinNoWinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoMacguffinNoWinner">where neither evil nor mortal forces can find it</a>. It's only a "suggestion" if the PCs agree, since if they don't, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">she will take the Egg anyway</a> regardless of the PCs' response... or attacks.

</li></ul></li><li> An early edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/WhiteDwarf">White Dwarf</a></em> magazine carried an article on how GMs could do this for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</a></em> in which it advised four steps: (1) Subtlety (2) Emotional Blackmail (3) Bribery with loot, and (4) Just dropping the plot and encounter in at the very next opportunity. It advised that the first three options rarely work and that sometimes it is best just to skip straight to step four.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> releases Adventure Paths which are six-volume campaigns that carry player characters from first level to roughly 17th before the end, though this varies. Needless to say, even the most open-ended of them can have some heavy-handed railroading in order to ensure the players are along for the ride.

<ul><li> In chapter 4 "Time Out" the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> are at a charity basketball game when the supervillain Arcade performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnockoutAmbush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnockoutAmbush">Knockout Ambush</a> by flooding the gymnasium with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnockOutGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnockOutGas">Knock Out Gas</a> in order to capture them. The module explicitly states that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> have no chance to avoid being rendered unconscious.
</li><li> Chapter 5 "Nightmare in New Guinea". The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> are at an audience with the Mandrill when he decides to capture them. He and his soldiers open fire on them with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGuns">neurostunner pistols</a> that cause unconsciousness. The game master is specifically told that if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> appear to be winning they should add more regular soldiers or even soldiers wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> — whatever is necessary to capture the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a>.
</li><li> At the end of chapter 8 "Terror in the Amazon" the building holding the gymnasium from Chapter 4 appears in the sky and begins pumping out the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnockOutGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnockOutGas">Knock Out Gas</a> that took out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> earlier. Again, the module says that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PC">PCs</a> can't avoid the effect of the gas.
</li></ul></li><li> Any game line with a strong metaplot tends to have a lot of this in published adventures. The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> had a sequence of adventures revolving around an NPC named Samuel Haight. No matter what the players did, they were never allowed to kill Haight or stop him from achieving his goals, because he was scheduled to turn up in future adventures.
</li><li> Published adventures for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CthulhuTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CthulhuTech">CthulhuTech</a></em> are infamous for this. In particular, the GM is often specifically instructed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">make sure the villains win one way or the other,</a> since having the good guys win would ruin the tone of horror and despair the game strives for. In another example, the adventure says that a particular character must become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> for a PC.
</li><li> An actual rule in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfSynnibarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WorldOfSynnibarr">World of Synnibarr</a></em> is that the GM has to show players his campaign notes after every session, and if he <em>didn't</em> railroad them they get bonus EXP. It also has a rule to enforce that; if the GM doesn't follow any and all rules in the book (for example "I don't want to railroad my players because that's BS"), the players can demand a reset of the adventure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>'s "Storm of Chaos" campaign: The premise was simple enough: Have matches regarding the story event at your FLGS and official tournaments, and the results would be sent in to an official website to help dictate the storyline of the event itself once the event concluded. The progress of the campaign would be measured by a map that would be updated depending on wins and losses taken during the event. Sadly, it didn't go as planned. <br/><br/>While the centerpiece of the event was the invasion of the Hordes of Chaos, a few problems became clear very quickly, including the fact that while the new edition rules had given massive buffs to certain factions, others weren't as well-balanced or powerful. Between this and a variety of other issues (a larger percentage of newcomers picking up Hordes armies based on their reputations, a large veteran playerbase sticking to their armies of choice, relatively bad balancing of the new rules in general), something amazing happened: Chaos got repeatedly swept in the matches that were sent in. The event wound up being a complete embarassment for GW's writers, who kept pushing forth Gav Thorpe's plot, regardless of how obvious it was that they were essentially ignoring the results of their own event. <br/><br/>During the early phases of the campaign, Chaos repeatedly failed to gain ground, and got held up, essentially, at every major battlefield, when it hadn't been outright routed going by the campaign maps. The response by GW's writing team was to basically start giving Chaos <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>, declaring wins that hadn't happened, and manipulating events so that Chaos won anyway. Arbitrarily, it was decided, apropos of nothing, that a plague from Nurgle destroyed Castle Lenkster, and that the Brass Keep was taken by the Skaven. This quickly became the start of a pattern. <br/><br/>Later in the campaign, Chaos was assumed to have reached Middenheim. The campaign progression showed otherwise, so GW moved up the battle lines to reflect what Games Workshop wanted. <br/><br/>In spite of this blatant act of favoritism on the part of GW, the forces of Chaos continued to lose repeatedly and hard on almost every battlefield. Chaos was held back at Middenheim for the entire next phase of the campaign, and never even got within striking distance of its walls according to the maps, such was how hard the Hordes were losing. Nonetheless, GW decided that they did actually reach the walls, though presumably being worried about backlash. The biggest "WTF" of the entire storyline was arguably Teclis single-handedly destroying not only Be'lakor, but his entire army, with a single spell. <br/> The end result of this clusterfuck of an event was that while shaking things up and moving the story forward would have been fine, GW had zero regard for what the players did, and indeed, constantly changed the event map to make it seem like less of a gigantic clusterfuck. Despite thousands of battle results being submitted, GW was content to ignore all of it and push their desired narrative anyway, making an event whose overall outcome was completely divorced from what actually happened. It left a bad taste in everyone's mouth, and though it was retconned out of existence later, the same idiocy that hallmarked it came back in force for The End Times in 8th Edition with one exception - there was no campaign to stop it.

This is brilliant. We can go wherever we want! Just hold on, where are we going, seriously. Hang on, let me just get my bearings. Umm, just follow the rail, actually." Many Valve games are designed in a very linear fashion, although the environments are well-designed enough to make it feel cinematic and interesting.

</li><li> The pinnacle comes with the Confusion Ending's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Stanley Parable Adventure Line</a>: a bright yellow line painted on the floor that you literally follow to the plot after you've skipped ahead to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the mind-control room</span> one time too many. Of course, it takes you to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the mind-control room, and the Narrator huffily has you ignore it from that point on.</span>
</li><li> The Confusion Ending even takes it one step further by revealing that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Narrator is being railroaded as well, and he's none too happy about it once he finds out.</span>
</li><li> In the Real Person Ending, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Narrator does everything he can to force the player to follow his intended story path, including removing the paths to other endings.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em>. Although the <em>narration</em> railroads you to complete the temples in a certain order, the gameplay itself is more open. So long as you grab the dungeon item in each temple, there is nothing stopping you from just leaving and completing the Fire Temple and/or Water Temple before completing the Forest Temple, and the Spirit Temple before the Shadow Temple or Fire Temple. But first-time players would have no way of knowing this. Also, thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">programming quirk</a> the game only checks to see if you've actually beaten the Shadow and Spirit Temple and merely assumes you beat the rest if you did; though to be fair, the only way to pull this off is to glitch the game anyway.
</li><li> In fact, Ocarina of Time is more open than many players realize. The Lens of Truth is optional if you memorize the path in the Haunted Wasteland, the Ice Cavern does not require the hookshot, the megaton hammer is not required for any other dungeon except for optional switches in the spirit temple, and the bow is not needed for the fire temple or prior to getting the longshot from the water temple (if you have din's fire). The only dungeons that have event based restrictions are the shadow and spirit temple where the former requires the first three dungeons to be completed while the latter just needs the forest temple.in fact, you can also reach the gerudo's fortress before getting the hookshot and the membership card before entering a dungeon if you get epona, who is otherwise optional.
</li><li> Speaking of Zelda, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">A Link Between Worlds</a></em> deliberately goes out of its way to avert this trope. It does this by bucking by-then fifteen year old tradition of "use the dungeon item you received to reach the next dungeon"; instead, nearly <em>all</em> of the major items are available to you at the beginning of the game, sold by the merchant Ravio. You can choose to rent the items for a cheaper price, or buy them and thus ensure they'll be yours forever (which also allows you to upgrade them). While certain dungeons do require specific items (especially among the first three dungeons, which outright tell you what you'll need), the majority of the game's levels can be beaten with any combination of tools. Thus, you're pretty much free to do the dungeons in whatever order you like (the only exception is a certain dungeon which requires an item you can't get until you clear another dungeon).
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>: Distinctly averted in contrast to the sequels. The game is very open and non-linear, to the point that all but two screens in Hyrule can be explored right off the bat, and you can get as far as Ganon (but not beat him) without even grabbing the sword. The ability to buy keys instead of searching for them allows you to travel through any dungeon at your own pace.

The only reason you can't explore the great sea in its entirety until the game decides you can is the King of Red Lions says no. If you warp to Mother and Child Island before the game wants you to you'll just be told to come back "when you're ready" to get the fire and ice arrows. If you head to a reef before the game decides it wants to let you conquer them said reefs will just be devoid of enemies.

The 4 shrines on the Great Plateau are mandatory (although they can be done in any order) but after that the player has complete freedom within the game to explore and wander. Certain upgrades require certain actions to unlock them, but none are required for beating the game.

The debt puts travel restrictions onto the entire party, meaning they are not allowed to travel to a new city, unless a certain amount of the debt has been paid off. And walking to a new city counts under these restrictions, so the player cannot by-pass that.

<ul><li> This is a usual criticism of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series. While the series is famous for its open worlds, the missions usually force the player to play them exactly the way the programmer intended, by doing things like making your opponent's car faster than yours no matter its model, making assassination objectives invincible until a forced chase ends or positioning your character in an inconvenient place through a cutscene so you can't have the advantage.
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em> was praised for its open world, its mission design was heavily criticized for being very restrictive. For just a few examples, a few deaths happen only because the attacker is invincible before they kill the victim and certain missions could be beaten easily with ways the player is not allowed to take. It can get pretty extreme, as simply cleaning your weapon during a mission may result in your allies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinueYourMissionDammit">complaining constantly until you are done</a> and dismounting your horse a few feet too early results in the game telling to you to remount it and ride to the target area.

<ul><li> <em>Red and Blue</em> gave us the 'HM' mechanic in addition to the usual NPC roadblocks, with this mechanic remaining a part of the series until <em>Sun and Moon</em> twenty years later. Certain obstacles can only be passed or cleared with special moves that work outside of battle. These moves are taught via items known as Hidden Machines, and are obtained through a side errand or event that is conveniently presented around the time you need said item. And even then, you can't use the move <em>outside</em> of battle unless you have the corresponding Gym Badge that allows you to do so. So instead of an NPC blocking you, it's most likely a tree, boulder, body of water. It doesn't matter if you have a hulking dragon with fearsome claws and fire-breathing skills in your pocket. You won't be able to get past that tree without the <em>Cut</em> move. The only reason you can take on a certain cluster of cities midgame in almost any order you want is because they're about two minutes from each other, in a '+' formation.
</li><li> Failing the tree/boulder blockade, the game will just toss an obstacle at you that needs a <em>key item</em>, like any usual RPG. Good luck getting past a Snorlax easily without the Flute, which you can only get after clearing a certain tower... which you need the Silph Scope for, to even see the ghosts inside to engage them without running. (A key item that, of course, has its own line of events.) Oh, and don't expect to just take on the Cinnabar Gym the moment you set foot on the island. You need to go fetch the key to the gym from an abandoned building... despite there being trainers inside that can probably just let you in.
</li><li> <em>Gold and Silver</em>: While the game has the now post-game region of Kanto be fairly open, allowing you to skip entire routes if you desire, the main region of Johto is fairly linear, also thanks to HMs and key items — and when those two aren't blocking you, you can bet there's a Team Rocket plot happening nearby that you absolutely must stop before you're allowed to move on. (Which gets hilarious when you remember your protagonist is, in fact, a child, who is constantly the one stopping these people.) Almost as if aware of the silliness of a twiggy tree blocking your path, this game introduces an intersection of three conveniently one-tile-wide paths... blocked in the middle with a <em>Pokémon that poses as a tree for the sole purpose of blocking you</em>, forcing you to take a detour around half the country to bypass it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, in addition to the usual arrangement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBridge">Broken Bridge</a> roadblocks, has some additional railroading justified by the plot: the Galar Pokémon League is run far more like an actual sports league than those in previous games. You have to take a specific route and challenge the Gyms in a particular order because those are League rules. In addition, Team Yell will prevent you from even scouting ahead, due to wanting to prevent everyone other than a girl from their hometown from easily progressing through the League.

</li><li> Exaggerated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TakeshisChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TakeshisChallenge">Takeshi's Challenge</a></em>. The player is given many, many things to do, but doing anything other than a precise series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">purposefully obtuse</a> actions will either kill you right away or render the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable.</a>
</li><li> Ironically, for a game where you're playing a character fighting for freedom, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> series got progressively more linear in mission structure as the series went on. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIII">Assassin's Creed III</a></em> assassinating Templars must be done in a specific, story-mandated way rather than killing them however you can. Ubisoft seems to have taken the criticism to heart for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></em> which is more open.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> is linear in general but the railroading reaches infamous heights with episode "Romulan Mystery", mission "Divide et Impera". If you take the time to read the text prompts it becomes pretty obvious pretty early that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Romulan weapons research lab is really a medical facility</span>, but the game forces you to keep going and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">Unwitting Pawn</a> enabling the Undine impersonating Admiral Zelle to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillAndReplace">Kill and Replace</a> the facility's commander</span>.

However, attempting to go off the rails will have Batman tell you no.
</li><li> <em>Fallout</em>:
<ul><li> The main quest of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> has this, more so in its later stages. For example, if you give the correct code to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Colonel Autumn after he kidnaps and interrogates you</span>, you are killed on the spot. More notably, at the end of the main quest, you are forced to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>... which will likely end up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidSacrifice">Stupid Sacrifice</a>, as 4 of 8 available companions should be able to do the job for you<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note00lqw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note00lqw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note00lqw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">3 of which are immune to radiation, and one who is a slave that does whatever you ask</span></span>. Fortunately, you can avoid the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span> part if you have <em>Broken Steel</em> installed but the narrator still criticizes the player for it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> downplays this. At the start of the game, taking the road straight north to Vegas will get you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">ripped apart by either Deathclaws or Cazadors</a>. You're supposed to go south to Primm, then Nipton, then Novac (incidentally following Benny's trail). Around that point, the game opens up and essentially allows you to go anywhere. However, clever (and borderline suicidal) players have found ways to sneak or simply tank their way straight from Goodsprings to Vegas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Fallout 4</a></em> doesn't let you skip over clues or quests in the first half of the game. Until you arrive at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Institute</span>, the conditions for each quest are directly set up by the completion of the quest before, and a major event that's <em>completely</em> unrelated to the main quest at that point (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the arrival of the Brotherhood of Steel's main force</span>) is blocked off until you've advanced far enough in the plot. Simply going out, looking for and finding your objective is prevented by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> making the Institute only accessible by teleportation, which you can only accomplish after completing the plotline</span>. After this, you can decide what to do, though the Minutemen are kept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvulnerableCivilians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvulnerableCivilians">essential</a> to ensure that you can always complete the main quest independently even if you antagonize all the other factions.
<ul><li> For double the pun, progressing along the main story <em>requires</em> you to find and interact with the faction called The Railroad. They are the only ones who can decode a certain chip to find the Institute.
</li><li> The game begins with the Vault-Tec repesentative coming to your home to inform you that your family has been pre-selected for Vault 111, and he asks you to fill out the registration paperwork, which takes the form of choosing your stats. You have the option to refuse him, but if you do he just keeps asking and becomes more insistent each time until your spouse forces you to fill out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">the paperwork/your character sheet</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Attempted quite poorly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6">Mega Man X6</a></em> with Alia's navigation. It's very clear the game designers meant for you to explore Commander Yammark's stage first, as that is the level where you get the introductory intel about the various nightmare enemies, but nothing stops you from visiting other levels. It's very possible to finish every other level and tackle Yammark's last, and <em>still</em> get the speech from Alia as if you've never faced the nightmare enemies you've probably gunned down by the hundred by now.
</li><li> Final Fantasy series examples:
<ul><li> Though <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> got quite a large share of flak from players for being "transparently linear", earlier games were far less kind and subtle in their railroading:
</li><li> Walking too far from your assumed path in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em> resulted in you fighting enemies about ten times as strong as your current level, with no indication what patch of field grass was suddenly considered a 'new area' where you'd get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a> in five seconds.
</li><li> Going to the wrong place without the right key item in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> simply kills the party in a cutscene... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in two separate points of the game, no less.</span>
</li><li> Just to be safe, assume that whenever you obtain a new method of transportation in a Final Fantasy game, you're either going to temporarily lose access to it, or discover a <em>new</em> obstacle it can't overcome, some time later when the developers want you to chase a particular goal without distractions.
<ul><li> This includes airships in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>. The airship isn't going to modify 'itself' to enable traveling to the moon faster than today's ships can.
</li></ul></li><li> In perhaps the most obnoxious example, in the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em>, much is made of the following decision: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whether Noel should go through with killing Caius or spare his life</span>. The game even provides a button-press option to choose between the two. But this is frustratingly betrayed by the plot in an example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">But Thou Must!</a>, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even if you choose to "spare" Caius, he commits suicide anyway and the exact same events unfold</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>, as an MMORPG, presents a very frustrating double subversion — once you've completed your introductory series of quests, you can access the entire world map, and it is perfectly possible to grind your way up to level 50 without touching any story quests along the way. However, this means you will be prevented from accessing most of the game's dungeons (including endgame content), you won't get a mount, and you won't get your relic items. It's even worse if you decide not to do class progression quests, as these are the only way to gain your class's key abilities and custom gear.
</li><li> At the climax of the penultimate chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXV">Final Fantasy XV</a></em>, the party is surrounded by an infinitely respawning horde of monsters, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Noctis's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> tell him to go on ahead to the elevator leading to the Crystal Chamber and reach the Crystal. The player can ignore this and continue to fight, but only up to a minute later, when a female electronic voice announces that the hangar in which the players are fighting will be sealed shut. To punctuate this, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">timer appears counting down to the door closing</a>, and if Noctis doesn't make it, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The concept is explored in an extremely meta sense by introducing the Whispers, ghost-like beings referred to as "arbiters of fate" who seem to be the Planet's attempt to enforce Destiny — as defined as the plotline of the original 1997 version of the game. They interfere whenever things diverge too much from the original timeline, sometimes to the protagonists' benefit (stopping Hojo from telling the group that Cloud wasn't really a SOLDIER) and other times to their detriment (seemingly trying to make sure that Wedge dies). [[spoiler:Sephiroth manipulates the heroes into destroying their leader by showing them contextless visions of what will happen if they "fail to stop them", freeing up destiny to be changed... <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetWrongWhatOnceWentRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetWrongWhatOnceWentRight">as he intended</a>. This turns the remake into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcon</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsTheSameAnymore">Nothing Is the Same Anymore</a>, several events happen differently and even some characters who died in the original story (most notably Zack Fair) are still alive when the credits roll.</span>

This level is so infamous that the phrase "NOT SKIP MOVIE" (which appears during said cutscenes) became a minor meme amongst the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> fandom.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJourneymanProject">The Journeyman Project</a></em> has this right in the beginning of the game. You're supposed to head to your job via transporter and if you so choose, you can decide to skip work and teleport to another location. Going anywhere other than the TSA and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">you're instantly uncreated due to a paradox created in the timeline</a>. Only by going to the TSA do you find out why the paradox happens in the first place.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em> does this on two occasions. The first is right after finishing all four initial Dossier missions, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Illusive Man</a> orders you to head to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">Horizon</a>, with no option but to go there. The second occurs after you have a total of eight recruited squad-mates and have completed at least five missions after Horizon. In this case, The Illusive Man orders you to board the Collector Ship. Only after the completion of that mission, do you have the freedom to do missions when you want. In both instances, this is justified as both of those missions are carried out while there is a narrow window of opportunity to strike at the Collectors before they scurry back through their special Omega-4 relay.
<ul><li> The Lair of the Shadow Broker DLC railroads you over to the Broker's ship almost immediately after killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestBossEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestBossEver">Tela Vasir</a>. The Overlord DLC strands you on a planet till the mission is complete, albeit for a very good reason, while the Arrival DLC has you take Kenson back to her project base immediately after her rescue, to continue the DLC's plot. Again, this is justified as she says that an important task must be done by a certain time.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>, with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideOpenSandbox">open and non-linear nature</a>, generally averts it. However, certain instances do pop up, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">typically to avoid making the game unwinnable</a>, and these instances have gotten more frequent as the series has gone on. To note:
<ul><li> Largely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>, since you can kill any NPC in the game, including those integral to the main plot. The downside of this, is that you can render the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a>. Fortunately, the game gives you a warning when killing an important NPC, allowing you to reload to a point before killing said NPC, and an alternative, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">rather obscure</a>, path to still finish the main quest, unless you kill NPCs required for <em>that</em> path, in which case you are forced to reload, should you want to finish the main quest...unless you grind yourself so high that you can complete the main quest through an exploit or sheer naked force. Also, <em>Morrowind</em> allows you to drop and sell items required to finish certain quests. Losing these items like this is another way to render the game unwinnable.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>. This game introduces the concept of "Essential" NPCs. Characters who are flagged as Essential can't be killed through combat. Whenever you defeat them, they merely fall unconscious and stand up a few seconds later. This is done to protect NPCs integral to the multiple questlines so you won't accidentally kill an NPC you later need in a quest. This does mean that you are forced play the quests exactly as the developers intended. <em>Oblivion</em> also prevents the player from removing and selling important quest-related items from their inventory, as a precaution to losing them and thus rendering the game unwinnable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> does both things <em>Oblivion</em> did before it did and takes its railroading a step further. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> in this game is the Dragonborn, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> with the potential to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>, capable of easily killing dragons. Yet the characters in the game always treat the Dragonborn as a mere human and there is nothing to make them respect (or even fear) you as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> you are. A specific example is the Forsworn Conspiracy questline in Markarth. After a while, the Dragonborn gets arrested by three corrupt guards. Despite being perfectly able to kill them and the rest of Markarth's army and pressure the Jarl into stopping the corruption, the only way to truly continue this quest is by meekly surrendering to the corrupt guards.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelltaleGames">Telltale Games</a> is sometimes accused of doing this, with some fans saying that despite their games' emphasis on choice, many of the said choices don't impact or change the story in any major way. To name one example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanTheTelltaleSeries">Batman: The Telltale Series</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even if players choose to prevent Harvey from getting disfigured, he'll still end up going crazy and become a villain later in the series.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, the player character must follow Duncan's lead and become a Grey Warden at the beginning of the game and embark on a quest to save the land from the Darkspawn. Some of the possible player characters have relatively humble origins and aren't too put out by this. The Human Noble, however, has very good reasons to refuse. While at first he is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor">second son</a> (or daughter) of a Teyrn (roughly equivalent to a Duke) and well down the line of succession, the betrayal of a vassal and initial battle with the Darkspawn leaves his entire family confirmed or presumed dead and the Teyrnir of Cousland leaderless. Needless to say this changes things greatly as the Human Noble is now the apparent successor of vast lands that will be thrown into a chaotic power vacuum, especially with the King of Ferelden dead as well. The timing could not be worse to join some questing band of do-gooders. But it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">impossible to insist</a> that you take on the responsibilities of noble leadership and the Human Noble is forced to instead enlist as one more foot soldier in the nearly defunct Ferelden branch of Grey Wardens. Never mind that your ancient family line will be ended (since Grey Wardens are short-lived even without a plague of invaders), your ancestral lands are being given to the man who betrayed and murdered your family, and you are the only person with the aristocratic standing to salvage the disaster for the teyrnir. Duncan (and the game's plot) don't care one bit. (Realizing, perhaps, that they had written themselves into a corner, the writers tried to salvage it in the epilogue. They do this by having your brother, with supreme timing, manage to have completely missed the entire Blight and survive, come home and inherit everything despite having done no work. That's the feudal system for you.)
</li><li> Deconstructing this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme">Central Theme</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deltarune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deltarune">Deltarune</a></em>. The game goes to great lengths to convince you that you have no agency and none of your choices matter. In the opening, you're given a character creation screen; as soon as you finish making your character, they're immediately discarded and the game condescendingly says that nobody chooses who they are before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterSelectForcing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterSelectForcing">making you play as Kris</a>. You are constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">forced down a single path</a> and offers to make a choice are often immediately rescinded, with the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gaslighting">creepily insisting</a> that "YOU ACCEPT EVERYTHING THAT WILL HAPPEN FROM NOW ON", even if you clearly <em>don't</em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> games are strictly railroaded to the point where nearly every choice you make won't affect the outcome in any possible way. When asked to present evidence for something, there's only one that matches what the developers want you to use, even if another piece of evidence would logically fit the solution <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2rm69');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2rm69" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2rm69');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some rare instances do let you use more than one piece of evidence if they're linked in some way, but that's still up to the whim of the developers</span>. When choosing how to respond or progress, choosing the wrong response will either have the player character ignore your choice and go with the correct one anyway, have the conversation repeat until you pick the right choice, or you'll get penalized for choosing wrong. While some of the games do have multiple endings, the bad endings are usually from you not picking the correct answers, thus the bad endings are abrupt and unfulfilling.
</li><li> The NES adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DickTracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/DickTracy">Dick Tracy</a></em> has railroading occur during its cases. You cannot arrest the suspect being interrogated if you have only one clue to prove they did the crime - you must have every single piece of evidence from the case and then arrest them. In the fifth and final case, every clue must be collected before the player can enter the final area of the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIDungeon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AIDungeon2">AI Dungeon 2</a></em> lets players do whatever they can imagine in theory. In practice, you'll spend some time fighting with the AI over control of the story and your character.
</li><li> <em>Ultimate General: Civil War</em> lets players re-fight battles of the American Civil War but periodically resets entire battlefields along historical lines regardless of player actions. This is probably most obvious for a Union player in the Chancellorsville scenario. First, the player is ordered to capture objectives that historically would've pre-empted the battle entirely but instead just triggers the next phase and redeploys the player in the Union's infamously vulnerable historical position. Succeed in defying history again by holding the line or even routing Stonewall Jackson's famous flank attack and <em>another</em> redeploys the player in an <em>even worse</em> position as if it succeeded, from which the player must sweep the entire field to gain a victory. And even if the player succeeds, the game moves on to its Salem Church scenario in which the player commands another Union force against the same odds they faced historically because the Union lost at Chancellorsville, even if the player just <em>destroyed</em> those same enemies in the previous scenario. Ironically, this makes the scenario almost unwinnable unless the player deliberately makes most of the same mistakes the Union generals did historically.
</li><li> At least when compared to the other games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AdvanceWars">Advance Wars</a></em> series, <em>Days of Ruin</em> is heavily railroaded. The previous games gave the player some choice such as choosing which missions you wanted to do, some choice in which order you wanted to complete them in, rewarded fast completion with extra missions and bonus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exposition">Exposition</a>, allowed you to unlock extra missions which would in turn unlock new units by exploring maps, offered the choice of which CO you wanted to use in which mission, and even allowed you to equip skills to characters to unlock new abilities or augment skills. Granted none of the previos games had <em>all</em> of these but Days of Ruin had none, only allowing you to follow a very specific roadmap of missions with no choice or deviance from the path, chose which specific CO you needed to use for every mission, and wouldn't even allow you to use CO Powers until about half-way through the game. Even the bonus missions were explicitly non-canon to the game's events and gave no rewards aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AxiomVerge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AxiomVerge">Axiom Verge</a></em> prevents you from leaving Ukin-Na until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeverDreamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeverDreamEpisode">Fever Dream Episode</a> is over.

You can't even get past the first few rooms without finding the Morph Ball. To access Kraid's Lair, most of Upper Norfair, Lower Norfair and many other rooms, you need the Morph Ball bombs. And to access many rooms, including the boss rooms and rooms with items, you need to have at minimum five missiles to blow open their locked doors. And to access Tourian, both Kraid and Ridley need to be killed.

<ul><li> The game is deliberately designed to downplay exploration in favor of combat and a more linear approach to gameplay. The main obstacle to progress is that the caverns you have to traverse are flooded by acid, and the only way to lower it is to kill a certain number of Metroids in each area. And because you need abilities like the Spider Ball and the Space Jump to find the Metroids, you have to thoroughly explore whatever area of the world you can before you can make any more progress.

The more you gather, the more and more the game opens up.

So during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveBinge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveBinge">Archive Binge</a>, you get to see how the GM accommodated his original plot points after <em>severe</em> derailing by the players. This actually shows that the <em>Darths &amp; Droids</em> game master may not be perfect, but is a really good GM, changing his planned plot around the flow of the game and the choices of his players rather than the other way around. As of Episode III it is becoming increasingly obvious that he is becoming tired of the players taking their own paths, and he vigorously attempts to steer them back onto the rails. When Pete (R2's player) GMs, however, the railroading stick hits <em>hard</em>. It is highly possible that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the destruction of Naboo</span> is the GM's way of making sure that they <em>don't</em> go off the rails.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DMOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DMOfTheRings">DM of the Rings</a></em>:
<ul><li> The entire comic is a screencap comic about characters going through the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> (which the players have never read) with a very bad DM who is quite blatantly railroading them, with the players attempting to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Off the Rails</a> as much as they can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(including attempting and succeeding at killing Gollum, Gríma and Saruman)</span>. The work evokes a common mindset behind railroading:
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant">The Rant</a>:</strong> Players tend to stay on the rails better when you place obvious landmines on either side of the tracks.
</div></li><li> In one comic, the group attempts to interrupt Gandalf's conversation with Théoden... only for the DM to start over from the beginning, causing them to compare it to a video game cutscene. In another, they ask why he even bothers running an RPG if he already knows the exact story he wants to tell. His response is because they chip in for pizza.
</li><li> In another hilarious example, the party is instead expected to help Gandalf out in his fight against the Balrog and defeat it together, but Gandalf is an insufferable, overpowered GM character that none of the players like, so they have to be railroaded into doing so. Much to the relief of the rest of the crew, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheRails">Gimli's player points out that their alignments mean they can't risk the opportunity to escape with the ring and promptly ditch Gandalf for "The greater good."</a> The irritated GM then railroads the plot back on track by resurrecting Gandalf with an incredible power boost, to everyone's annoyance.
</li><li> Another shining example is the scene where Éowyn asks to join the Fellowship: In the books and films Aragorn says no<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note42rcv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note42rcv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note42rcv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">or more precisely, that it's not his place to give her permission</span>, but the comic's version says yes (as he doesn't see any reason not to). When the DM realizes this, he has Éowyn inexplicably go from begging to come along to arguing that she can't come along. When Aragorn says "Okay, then no", Éowyn goes right back to begging, quoting most of her actual dialogue in the process and coming off as increasingly schizophrenic. In the end, she does get left behind as per the original plot, but only because Aragorn's player got so frustrated at dealing with her that he just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">rode away from her in mid-conversation</a>.
</li><li> The railroading is so bad that, after a particularly monotonous fight scene against a seemingly infinite army of orcs ending in Boromir's death, Frank (his player) flat-out refuses to reroll a new character.

<div class="indent"> 638. The DM is not impressed by me spoiling his well planned ambush by just casting Glassee on the door. <br/>739. Can't make the blacks ops super easy by sending a couple of strippers to the guardroom first. <br/>840. Even if it would have immediately solved the last six adventures, I won't throw dynamite in every well I come across. <br/>977. Disable plot device is not a real skill. <br/>1060. I will go into the villain's lair and take him out the old fashioned way. Not just wait outside his favorite bar with a rifle. <br/>1071. I will go take out the villain's dungeon the old fashioned way, and not use magic to reroute a river into it instead. <br/>1137. I have to go into the dungeon, not just send in dozens of summoned creatures every morning. <br/>1241. It takes more than one pick pocket roll to totally derail the campaign. <br/>1256. "Ignore the metaplot" is also not an acceptable super power. <br/>1293. I can't avoid plot mandated ambushes no matter how hard I try. <br/>1383. Portable Plothole is not a real magic item. <br/>1404. I will not spoil the adventure's mandatory ambush by using the cheesy tactic of a "scout". <br/>1413. Even if the dungeon has only one exit, can't just starve the villain out. <br/>1432. Using my prior knowledge of the adventure to force the game along <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByNoIMeanYes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByNoIMeanYes">while encouraged, is discouraged</a>. <br/>1436.

Unusual in that it's instigated by the other players rather than the GM, but the GM goes along with it and kind of implies that it's Spoony's fault for not picking one of the two Clans prominent in the setting. Spoony's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow">in-character response</a> is to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">using the guards'</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGuardsMustBeCrazy">lack of checking Spoony for weapons</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">his skill in Chemistry</a>, to create a bathtub full of Semtex and blow up the vampire's headquarters and anything in a two-block radius of it. It ends with the GM basically telling Spoony "I think you should leave."
</li><li> In another episode, Spoony discusses the concept of railroading as a necessary evil, saying that even if there's an obvious, ham-fisted plot hook at the start of a game, sometimes you have to swallow your pride and take it because otherwise, there won't <em>be</em> a game.
</li><li> Happened in a pretty big way during the 2012 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/D20Live" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/D20Live">D 20 Live</a> campaign.

Linkara points out that a drink so strongly spiked that it would make one pass out just from the smell would likely kill the other players who chugged the stuff down.
