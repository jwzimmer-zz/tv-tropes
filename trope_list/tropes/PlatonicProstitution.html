She's probably had a world's worth of men, ranging from unsavory to less savory. But sometimes, either to her relief or to her profound annoyance, she meets one of these.
</p><p>These men — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysMale">and they're almost always men</a> — visit prostitutes not to have sex with them, as one would expect, but for some other purpose. Perhaps he's religious and trying to reform her. Perhaps she's too young for the business and he wants to get her out of it. Perhaps he just wants conversation and can't think of another way to get it, or he wants his friends to think he's more promiscuous than he really is. Perhaps he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmateurSleuth">wants information</a> concerning one of her clients. Perhaps he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Transgender</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Sweet Polly Oliver</a>, and doesn't want her to discover this. Perhaps he needs a grunt for something and figures, "If you'll have sex for money, there's not a lot you won't do for money." Perhaps he's a widower who misses the warmth of a woman sleeping next to him. If other characters find out, they will rarely believe that he's not in it for the sex.

<ul><li> Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a>: The Second Raid</em>, Sōsuke is approached by a prostitute who looks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalStranger">almost exactly like Kaname</a>. Since he's deep in the throes of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>, he lets her pick him up as a client, but he's only really interested in talking through some of what's on his mind. When she tries to initiate sex with him, he freaks out and leaves.
</li><li> Ichimatsu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SamuraiGun">Samurai Gun</a></em> is one of these. To the frustration of the lady, since she's in love with him and would actually like to sleep with him, especially after he rescues her from the whorehouse and gets her a proper job.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> Jin falls for a girl when he sees her standing on a bridge and discourages her from jumping (characteristically enough, he does this by informing her that the water is too shallow and the drop too short — she'd most likely just wind up breaking a leg). He later finds out that she was contemplating suicide because she'd been sold to a whorehouse to cover her husband's gambling debts, and after shaking down Mugen for cash, he buys his way in to see her — in order to try and convince her to leave her husband and run away. They eventually <em>do</em> end up having sex, but only after it becomes clear that she's fallen for him as well.
</li><li> In the <em>Doll</em> manga, one of the main characters owns a sophisticated male robot designed for sex, but refuses the robot when it comes onto him, much to the robot's confusion (turns out he has bigger plans for him).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BladeOfTheImmortal">Blade of the Immortal</a></em>, Magatsu hides out at a brothel occasionally, since he's a wanted man, and befriends one of the girls there. However, while he does share a bed with her, he refuses to touch her out of respect, even though O-Ren makes it clear she loves him and wants them to have sex.
</li><li> Kenji does this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwentiethCenturyBoys">20th Century Boys</a></em> in order to gain access to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Professor Shikijima's daughter</span>.
</li><li> In one of the side stories written for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VictorianRomanceEmma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VictorianRomanceEmma">Victorian Romance Emma</a></em>, a prostitute propositions the lonely-looking young opera singer protagonist at the pub. He spends a pleasant evening with her — by buying her dinner and having a nice chat.

They are wrong, he's actually nice inside. The proprietor is his aunt and adoptive mother, and he uses the girls as an information network.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Texhnolyze">Texhnolyze</a></em> when Yoshii gets a prostitute who starts acting like a Dominatrix, he stops her and tells her he just wants to talk. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">We soon find out he killed her after getting information.</span>
</li><li> Gintoki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> is maneuvered into this situation with Tsukuyo. (To make a long story short, he was promised free drinks.) Tsukuyo assumes that she's supposed to sleep with him to pay him for saving Yoshiwara. Gintoki is appalled at the suggestion. It would have been a nice, friendly evening after that except for Tsukuyo's alcohol intolerance and subsequent violent behaviour.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999">X1999</a></em>: Seiichirou Aoki met Karen Kasumi during her workshift. Rather than asking for erotic service, he interviews her. They become good friends afterwards. At the end of the anime, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seiichirou visits Karen's grave together with his family</span>.

<ul><li> One of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RoadToPerdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RoadToPerdition">Road to Perdition</a></em> stories has Michael O'Sullivan visiting an underage prostitute named Juana who he wants information from concerning his nemesis Connor Looney. For obvious reasons, he doesn't do anything with her, but instead gets the information that he needs from her and leaves her with enough money to leave if she wants to.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable">Knights of the Dinner Table</a></em>, Chad had a girlfriend whom he hadn't told about his roleplaying hobby out of fear of ridicule. But when Patty and the other members of his groups harp on him about telling her the truth, he finally relents and offers to invite her to a game. Instead, he hires an escort for an hour to show up and pretend that she's his girlfriend. Turns out that Trish <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyCommonKink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyCommonKink">loves</a></em> roleplaying games and lets him have an extra forty-five minutes free before she gets called away. After she leaves, though, Patty lets Chad have it, having seen right through the charade (for one thing, her hair was the <em>wrong color</em>). In a follow-up strip, Tank ends up spending over two hundred dollars to have Trish on a date and play Battleship for a few hours.
</li><li> While spying on a target in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WelcomeBackFrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WelcomeBackFrank">Welcome Back, Frank</a>" story arc, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> paid a prostitute two hundred dollars to eat lunch with him at the restaurant and forget the entire thing — he would have been too obvious if he had been there alone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Transmetropolitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a></em> had a rather strange but heartbreaking example. Spider solicits two young boys who are prostituting themselves on the street, paying them with food for an interview about their "business". The heartbreaking part comes in when one of the boys asks if they can go to a restaurant that has toys.
<div class="indent"> "You forget they're just kids."
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedEars">Red Ears</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied. A hooker is approached by an unknowing John in a bar and gives him an offer of "anything he wants" if he can express it in three words only. He ponders for a moment before replying "paint my house".
</li><li> Another strip had an insomniac hire a streetwalker to read him a bed-time story. She obliges, but is rather nonplussed.
</li><li> One strip featured a truck driver paying a ridiculous sum at the local brothel for "the ugliest prostitute you have, wearing a bathrobe, no make-up and flip-flops, calling me an asshole while I eat a grilled cheese sandwich and drink beer in front of the TV". No sex. The woman he hired is naturally curious what's up, so he admits that he's just homesick.
</li></ul></li><li> Done twice in the <em>Pocket Men</em> collection. A man, unhappy with his wife, approaches a hooker to take home, only to be revealed that he wants someone to taste his wife's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a> concoctions. Another strip has a man approached by a streetwalker, thinking about his loving wife, realizing his wife loves to chat, and bringing the hooker home to have a conversation with her while he enjoys some sleep.

At the Border Crossroads Inn, George and John need to get some information from a waitress. While she's not willing to go up to their room with them to have sex, she agrees to come when they explain they just want information and will even pay her. However, for a complicated reason, another woman is sent along with her, and the woman is a known tattler who will immediately report any shenanigans to the persons currently running the inn. So George has to have sex with the tattler to distract her, while John, who <em>can't</em> have sex with human women any more, has to fake it while he telepathically interrogates the waitress. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li><li> <em>"Batteries"</em> implies Satsuki did something like this, as Shiro mentioned that, while she worked in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedLightDistrict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedLightDistrict">Red Light District</a>, she didn't "sleep around or take off her clothes".

The prostitutes were used to dealing with shy young boys trying to prove something (which she appeared to be), so they didn't mind, and few figured out what was really going on. In the modern era, Justine Flanner is fleeing from a secret base that was destroyed by an Unshaper attack, and ends up taking shelter in a Nevada brothel.

Leonid, the protagonist, is running away from a mob of angry gamers and enters the first building he sees, which turns out to be a brothel. While he initially doesn't want to hire a prostitute, he starts thumbing through the catalog and sees someone who looks exactly like his Windows avatar. He hires her but doesn't sleep with her. They spend their time just talking. They do have virtual sex later after he takes her out on a date. There is another man who is a regular at the brothel whose thing is to hire a prostitute and then spend the time berating her for being the scum of society. According to Leonid's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, this is much worse than just sex, no matter how perverted (it's not real, anyway), as this is literally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> for an unfortunate girl who happens to be hired by him. For reference, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> only runs the virtual brothel as an experiment for her Ph.D. thesis in Psychology, so if anybody knows how such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screws</a> can affect a person, it's her.

When she wonders aloud what use a eunuch would have for a brothel, her captain responds that "even those who lack a man's parts may still have a man's heart" — the eunuch paid the women to "lay with him and hold him." It's something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>.
</li><li> After Tywin explicitly tells Tyrion he can't bring Shae to court, Tyrion keeps her safe in an undisclosed location that can be reached via a tunnel connected to a brothel. Tyrion visits Alayaya, the prostitute whose room connects to one end of the tunnel, pretending to stay the night but instead sneaking off to be with Shae. Alayaya says she likes the alone time a lot and has been using it to teach herself to read. Perhaps the first time someone has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeard">The Beard</a> for a member of the same gender!

One amusing example is a client who asked her to bring a lot of exciting lingerie... so she could sit on the couch and tell him how nice he looked in it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em>, Tavi is known to visit a whorehouse outside the army camp ... to get a hot bath all alone, his clothes washed, and check on his spy network. Which is implied to be why Kitai doesn't kill him for it.
</li><li> Seen in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> novel <em>Close Quarters</em>. Cassie Suthorn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">properly paranoid</a> scout for the mercenary regiment Camacho's Caballeros <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">with some deep-seated psychological issues of her own</a>, is looking for information for anything suspicious that might be going on around the city where their latest employer is paying them to stay and among other things ends up chatting amiably enough with a trio of prostitutes she's paid the going rate for their time. Then their pimp shows up, takes exception, and generally makes an ass of himself...so she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">kills him and takes over his job</a>, at least temporarily. (The women aren't then actually seen again for the rest of the book, but her comrades don't miss the opportunity to comment on it.)
</li><li> Stephen Maturin of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin">Aubrey-Maturin</a></em> book series routinely stays at brothels when on expedition to distant cities, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisBedOfRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisBedOfRoses">only as lodging</a>. It is cheaper and less conspicuous than a boarding-house, and (more importantly) it allows him to meet with and question sailors from Spain and France for his espionage work. Since he also routinely runs into sailors from his own ship, however, stories have spread among Aubrey's crew about his surprising wealth in being able to whore and drink night after night on shore.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedeemingLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedeemingLove">Redeeming Love</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Michael</a> spends all of his savings this way in order to get the towns most sought-after "soiled dove," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Angel</a>, alone long enough to propose marriage to her. Repeatedly. All of his visits are rather awkward and vitriolic, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Angel</a> is definitely not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold">Hooker with a Heart of Gold</a>. (He is ultimately successful in marrying her, but not via this trope.)

Everyone in the village knows the priest is sneaking off to the brothel, so there's a series of reveals around the fact that it's platonic, and why: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">1) He's too devout and has barely started to touch her when guilt sets in; 2) he spends a lot of time trying to convince her to abandon her ways, with some success; and 3) they are both in love with each other.

She ends up just using him as a shoulder to cry on, and later asks for him again by name for the same reason.
</li><li> In the first book of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a>'s <em>SERRAted Edge</em> series, the protagonist hires a runaway teen prostitute specifically to get her off the streets.

</li><li> <em>Fraternity of the Stone</em>, by David Morrell. The protagonist spends the night with a prostitute to avoid sleeping in a hotel, as he's on the run from people who have already gone to great lengths to track him down and kill him. However he has trouble convincing the woman he doesn't want to sleep with her (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaithTurn">he's a monk</a>), yet isn't planning something nasty instead. They do share the bed; he pretends this is out of a desire to just hold her for comfort, when actually it's to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">ensure she can't sneak out of the room without waking him up</a>.

Of course, he later gets a call stating that she's "blown them all away," which he notes kept forgetting to include the "away". It's also shown that while she was frequently hired by Michael's womanizing father and brother, both also used her as a "shoulder to cry on" rather than for sex. She ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold">Hooker with a Heart of Gold</a>, saving the company by spending money in a secret account inside the company to benefit the workers in order to avoid embezzlement charges.

One episode had House auditioning girls after his regular tells him she's leaving the business. Skills he's interested in are fixing home appliances and tuning pianos. Why? He says he wants to get something out of them for the remaining 57 minutes of the hour he pays for.

For the duration of his paid time, he's made to dig with Leslie and her friends to find the arrowheads she seeded, with him getting reminded that they paid for his time there.
</li><li> In a flashback from the fourth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>, John Locke converses with a phone sex operator as if they share a relationship. He tries to get her to accompany him to Australia but she completely dismisses him as merely a customer.

</li><li> In French series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kaamelott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Kaamelott">Kaamelott</a></em> (episode "L'Habitué" — "The Usual Customer"), we find that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Perceval</a> has been seeing the same prostitute for a long time now.

Not "prostitutes" technically, for obvious legal reasons, but escort girls. Much fun was had listening to them explain in graphic detail just how little shade of difference there was between the two, if any. He would then pay them to join him for some completely wholesome activity like bowling. Bowling while sloppy drunk at 3AM, but wholesome all the same.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd">The IT Crowd</a></em>, Moss accidentally tells a crowd of people about how he and his fellow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life Partner</a> ended up picking up some prostitutes but were too nervous to do anything with them.

</li><li> Parodied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall">The Kids in the Hall</a></em>, where a nice man offers to take the prostitute away from her life of prostitution, and ends up marrying and having kids with her... and then the money runs out and her pimp (now an old man) comes to hassle the guy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Saxondale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Saxondale">Saxondale</a></em>, an old mate of Tommy's who he's reunited with hires a couple of prostitutes for an evening. Whilst Tommy's mate receives the standard service, Tommy himself is in a happy, stable relationship and unwilling to risk it, with the result that he and the other prostitute end up in her room sitting on the bed making awkward conversation. Much to his bemusement, she ends up giving him some useful pointers on how to help improve his fading vision without resorting to his glasses; turns out she's an optometry student.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CurbYourEnthusiasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CurbYourEnthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em> episode "The Car Pool Lane", Larry picks up a prostitute just so he can use the high-occupancy-vehicle lane to get to Dodger stadium in time for the game (being Larry, he then haggles over the amount she charges him based on the number of blowjobs he believes she could fit into the same amount of time).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>:

As soon as she turns up for their "date", Beckett intercedes.
</li><li> Same prostitute, different client: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">Victim of the Week</a> apparently hired the call girl mostly to talk, due to his career leaving him little time to actually date (though she did specify <em>mostly</em>, so they did still have sex). It then turns out that he had taken over the whole prostitution organization from its previous pimp, and used the call girl to run the day-to-day operations.
</li><li> While she was a model rather than prostitute, he also arranges a date with a young woman he meets during a case. A <em>playdate</em>, that is: she used to babysit his daughter for him and he thinks having Alexis around will help keep the model out of trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds">Criminal Minds</a></em>, it's not unheard of for serial killers to hire prostitutes to serve as their victims. In some cases, it's because the unsub has a problem with prostitution (and is trying to either punish or "purify" the prostitutes). Other times, it's just because prostitutes are easy to get alone and vulnerable. They're considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSexWorker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSexWorker">High Risk targets</a> for that reason. Of course, some don't even bother with the "hiring" part.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDeuce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDeuce">The Deuce</a></em>: An elderly client of Darlene's has her come over just to watch television in bed with him - no sex.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>
<ul><li> Inara isn't <em>just</em> a prostitute, though sex is usually included as part of the "Companion" package. Nevertheless a few clients (like Atherton Wing) hire her for a primary role other than sex (though it was implied that sex was in the offing, at least before Mal went and got himself into a duel with Atherton).
</li><li> In "Jaynestown", a governor hires Inara to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginShaming">"make a man" out of his son</a>. Being more simple than her usual clientele, he gets angry when she doesn't immediately sleep with the boy but starts with a tea ceremony and a conversation. She does sleep with the son eventually but only because she happens to like him. The Companions only accept offers from people they like.
</li><li> The show portrays a clear distinction between Companions (basically, a courtesan with a high social status) and regular prostitutes. In "Heart of Gold", a local ruler's primary use for a prostitute is to conceive a male heir. Even his wife is relieved upon hearing the news that the girl is pregnant with her husband's son.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em>, Keith goes to see a prostitute, but to get her to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">provide an alibi for Abel Koontz that he was 'elsewhere' on the night of Lily Kane's murder</span>.
</li><li> JJ in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Skins">Skins</a></em>, largely because he'd been dragged to the brothel against his will (by Cook).
</li><li> Inverted on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MANswers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MANswers">MA Nswers</a></em>, where asking streetwalkers to do some paid nude modeling is suggested. The inversion is that it's a ploy to determine if they're undercover vice cops (who wouldn't accept such a legal proposition) before actually offering them money for sex.
</li><li> A variant: on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpecialUnit2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpecialUnit2">Special Unit 2</a></em>, Nick goes to a strip club and pays to have two twin strippers alone in the private room for an hour. His partner Kate is rather annoyed, until she realizes they're actually supernatural creatures (the politically-correct term is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">Links</a>", thank you very much) he needs to interrogate for the latest case.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em> is largely similar to this trope: the Dolls are often imprinted for sex, but can take on any number of legal or illegal jobs, and even romantic engagements can be about more than sex or no sex at all (for example, Joel Maynard having Echo imprinted with his dead wife, or another man getting <em>his</em> dead wife imprinted to help him take care of the couple's baby). Lampshaded when Topher imprints Sierra for his birthday. He doesn't want her for sex, he just wants a friend to help him celebrate.
</li><li> A skit on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> has Alec Baldwin appearing to be one of these (even orchestrating a telephone reunion with her estranged mother), until he asked for a handjob, explaining that he "gets off" on getting personal with prostitutes.

Horace the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternUnionMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternUnionMan">Western Union Man</a> was in love with Myra, one of the prostitutes at the local saloon, and she with him. He paid the saloon owner to spend time with her, and they just talked. After she left the biz, they got married.
</li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MADtv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MADtv">MADtv</a></em>, where a guy hires a prostitute to verbally abuse him, just like his ex-wife used to.

Several other men (in some versions prominent characters in the story) can be seen lounging around the brothel, reading the paper or getting a foot massage. Of course, it's still <em>heavily</em> implied that Mack has sex with the prostitutes, but Brecht's point was to show that the <em>habit</em> of visiting a brothel every week was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">symbol of the decadence of the bourgeoisie, and therefore more condemnable than the actual sex act</a>. Also, the prostitutes selling their own skin are meant to represent the result of a capitalist system in which, as Marx and Engels stated, the common worker is robbed of the ownership of his tools and forced to sell himself on a daily basis to fit into the fascist ideology or a two-class society.

Ironically, the only way you get sex is to piss her off at the right moment; she then thinks that since the social interaction was a waste, she might as well get her money's worth.

It might have entailed the usual stuff, but it might just as well have entailed anything else one does in a quiet environment, from massages to board games to a casual conversation.

Orel creates a service setting up appointments for the people of Moralton to witness to sinners. Most of the sinners are prostitutes, most of his customers are men, and Orel never realizes that very little witnessing is really going on.
</li><li> A variation occurs on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em>, when Stan goes with his co-workers to a strip club despite being very uncomfortable. He winds up giving health advice to one of the strippers and hiring several of them to work at a laundromat he wanted to start up.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, Homer is taking Santa's Little Helper out for a last night of debauchery before having him neutered, which includes hiring a canine prostitute for him. Homer asks the bitch's owner, who is also a prostitute, if she's up for some air hockey while they wait. She tells him she's $350 an hour, to which he replies "It's a deal!" and rushes into the nearby arcade while the prostitute drags her feet to stretch the time.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15h9m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15h9m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15h9m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Homer is getting horribly ripped off, btw. $350 is a competitive rate for a call girl (middle class prostitute) in 2018; a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Streetwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Streetwalker">Streetwalker</a> (lower class) in 2003 wouldn't have a rate anything near that.

</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> music number, Brian is telling the shut-in Pearl just what she missed in the thirty or so years she's lived alone. In explaining how Las Vegas became more family friendly, we see a man pay a prostitute who goes down on her knees to give lollipops to the man's two children.

The two just sit around in a dingy apartment waiting, with her reading a magazine and charging him extra for him apparently wanting to bring someone else in. Bob eventually realizes that the Devil isn't interested in hanging out somewhere he's already corrupted, so he dismisses the prostitute and goes to a Habitat for Humanity site instead.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk">Rasputin the Mad Monk</a> reportedly would hire prostitutes, have them strip naked in front of him, stare at them for a while, and then dismiss them, after which he would walk the streets berating himself for his lustful thoughts. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>, as Rasputin was part of a small group of Christians who essentially believed in deliberately sinning so they could then receive forgiveness from God.
</li><li> Earlier even than Rasputin, William E. Gladstone (a British Victorian Era prime minister) was very interested in reforming "fallen women". He would often walk the streets of London at night, take a prostitute home, spend the entire night reading to her from the Bible, then spend what's left of the day flagellating himself in penance for any lustful thoughts the encounter generated. This apparently caused a lot of prurient speculation, but Gladstone got a free pass for this one as he did set up a large charity and many halfway houses for helping said "fallen women". <br/><br/>For that matter Mrs. Gladstone was an active participant in the project, serving tea and taking her turn in reading. Gladstone's son was suspicious about the whole business and asked his father what was really going on. Gladstone replied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">he had never committed "the act of infidelity."</a> Some observers of Victorian culture have noted that, technically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">oral sex</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">would not have been considered "the act of infidelity."</a> <br/><br/>Many activists today still book time with prostitutes in order to have a chance to talk to them and convince them to abandon the trade. In such circles, not paying the lady (or gentleman) the usual rates for their time is heavily frowned upon.
</li><li> Sex blogger and professional dominatrix Mistress Matisse has warned potential johns against this behavior — it makes the nice lady nervous. Indeed, this is standard for dommes, and anyone hiring one should assume this is how it works unless told otherwise. This really isn't any different from the fact that strippers don't, by default, have sex with their clients. It's a different brand of sex work.
<ul><li> A large number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestProfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestProfession">women in the trade</a> <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> spend time with their clients <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">in other ways beside sex</a>-going out, escorting and so on. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">It takes mutual trust, sympathy and luck. True, not faked</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geisha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Geisha">Geishas</a> very rarely actually had sex with their clients, and were instead predominately hired for their ability to entertain with music, dance, conversation and storytelling. A proverb of old Kyoto said that a man goes to a courtesan to pleasure the body, and to a Geisha to pleasure the soul. And the few remaining ones still are — sex is permanently off the menu these days (though you can get prostitutes dressed <em>as</em> geishas, but they aren't the real deal). Classically, one could tell a geisha from a prostitute by how their sash was tied; while geishas tied theirs in the back, often helped by a servant, a prostitute's was tied in the front, so she could quickly get her kimono open. Geishas were never prostitutes but they could be "retained" as mistresses or formal concubines. This however was regarded as a kind of marriage and the lady was faithful to her patron. These days a Geisha's sex life is considered her own business.
<ul><li> A Geisha however could not be a virgin and her 'first time' was a commodity that could be sold and allowed her trainer to recoup a large chunk of her investment. This of course is no longer done. Another old time practice was the Geisha sleep-over where both the women and their clients ended the evening by settling down to sleep in the same room - like a large mixed sex slumber party. A certain amount of horseplay took place but chaperones were on hand to keep the fun from getting out of hand.
</li></ul></li><li> The eccentric Austrian sociologist and socio-cultural anthropologist Roland Girtler has written many books about outsiders of society. In his books, he has said that he got the stories and information about prostitutes by paying them for talking to him. He says that he might as well just talk to them, because he pays them anyway.
</li><li> Hetaerae in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Ancient Greece</a> had methods very similar to those of Geishas — there were even identical sayings about them; that you need a wife for your house, a prostitute for sex, and a Hetaera for the pleasure of your soul.
</li><li> While making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bloodrayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bloodrayne">Bloodrayne</a></em>, Uwe Boll infamously hired actual Romanian prostitutes to play... well, prostitutes. Why? They were cheaper than hiring extras, who would have to be paid SAG minimum. Which is... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">unusually ingenious of him</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Channel4">Channel 4</a> once made a documentary about the sex trade involving two undercover reporters, one of them posing as a new, and then regular, customer in a brothel who always hired the same woman but only ever asked for a massage (the other reporter went undercover <em>working in the brothel</em> — but only as a receptionist).
</li><li> Likewise, Peter Jennings once did a report on child prostitution in Romania by pretending to be a client for the various boys (who were all orphans being pimped by their older brothers because they had no other means of survival). He'd hire them, interview them, and then make up some excuse not to have sex with them, drop them off and leave.
</li><li> A columnist for the Nevada Sagebrush did this as the subject of his last column, <a class="urllink" href="http://nevadasagebrush.com/blog/2008/05/06/i-paid-100-to-cuddle-with-a-prostitute/">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Travel writer Tim Moore did a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Monopoly">Monopoly</a></em> board tour of London for the book <em>Do Not Pass Go</em>, looking into the history and character of the places used in the standard UK version of the game. At his first stop, King's Cross station, he experiences the area's seedy underbelly by hiring a Brazilian transgender person to play a game of Monopoly.
</li><li> An American photographer did a project about male prostitutes in Los Angeles. After taking their pictures, he would pay them the amount they would have charged for sex, and the pictures would be titled with the man's name, home town and the amount, e.g <em>Dan, Albuquerque, $25.</em>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2227708/Jackie-Samuel-snuggle-Cuddling-makes-woman-260-day-New-York.html?ICO=most_read_module">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> New York based professional cuddler. Technically not prostitution, but she has been called one.
</li><li> Freakonomics and Super Freakonomics, by Dr. Levitt, features several looks at the economics of the world's oldest profession, at least in the US. First, the majority of prostitutes aren't making that much for sex acts, but surprisingly, a higher-class prostitute who charges hundreds of dollars an hour has to perform a lot less acts for her clientele than a street prostitute. "Allie" was such a prostitute, and she was usually wined and dined more as her rates started to climb to several hundred an hour. She was being paid in part to give the illusion of "the perfect companion," as much as sex. Of course, it helped that "Allie" was very attractive, very well-educated, charming, well-read, and cultured. Of course, prostitutes of lower socioeconomic status were never wined-and-dined and subject to physical abuse, arrest, and worse. The economic data also showed lower-class prostitutes were "cheaper" if paid in drugs, actually gained a net benefit from having a pimp, and most surprisingly often worked seasonally, supplementing their income by turning tricks when tourists came to town.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanSavage">Dan Savage</a> has been known to recommend that socially-awkward men hire hookers for conversation to get used to talking to women, though he did once recommend this as a method of screening out undercover cops when trying to hire one for the usual purpose, as if she is a cop she won't make a followup appointment but won't arrest the john if he doesn't actually request sex. "There's nothing illegal about paying an escort to escort you places."
</li><li> Some sex therapists employ <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/personal-experiences-2260-f23ck21ng-people-therapy-inside-sexual-surrogacy.html">sex surrogates<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose purpose is to get patients used to being touched, trusting and interacting with the opposite sex, healthy sexual relationships, communication, etc. if the patient seeking help does not have a spouse or significant other. In fact, although sex is involved, it's only a <em>very</em> small part of the sex surrogate's work. Unlike most examples, they usually are not paid <em>directly</em> by the patient, but by the therapist who employs them.
</li><li> The "Sugar Daddies" industries, in which young women in their 20s are put in touch with financially successful older men (usually from their 40s to 60s), and in exchange for companionship (which may not necessarily involve sex) the men offer expensive gifts or financial assistance to the young women (since most of them are struggling with college fees, rent or other debt).
</li><li> In one early biography of St. Simeon of Emesa, it's said that when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">holy fool</a> heard that women were turning to prostitution out of financial desperation, he hired them to become his "girlfriends," paying them extra so they would not sleep with anyone else— and of course, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VowOfCelibacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VowOfCelibacy">a monk</a>, he wouldn't sleep with them either, thus preserving their chastity.
</li><li> At one point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PattonOswalt">Patton Oswalt</a> was offered a prostitute by a madame (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">or rather, the web administrator of an online escort service</a>), but after hearing of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a>, he decided to simply get dinner with her. He later joked that she must have been absolutely bewildered and likely wondered if they had had sex and she had just missed it somehow.
