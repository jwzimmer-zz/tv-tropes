<div class="indent">— <strong>Frank Loesser</strong>, "The Inch Worm" from the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HansChristianAndersen1952" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HansChristianAndersen1952">Hans Christian Andersen (1952)</a></em>

It implies that appreciation is a <em>feeling</em>, not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesMathematics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesMathematics">number</a>, and that reducing the divinely incomprehensible to the mundanely complex isn't just tedious and hard, it's fundamentally <em>wrong</em>.
</p><p>This trope is, at heart, a reaction against hyper-intellectualism; fear and frustration with assigning a number or a scientific name to everything from rainbows to emotions. It could be summed up as "put away your calculator and enjoy the beautiful sunrise". It can appear anti-intellectual because it can imply that only people that don't know anything about a subject can appreciate it.
</p><p>Naturally, experts in the given subject are repulsed by this idea. Their <em>understanding</em> is never questioned, just their ability to appreciate it. Nobody has ever, for instance, advocated fielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">Generals</a> who know absolutely nothing about planning, logistics, strategy, or tactics but feel like they have deep psycho-spiritual connections with warfare. Experts that fully understand their field are actually <em>very</em> attuned to its beauty. You rarely, after all, spend a big chunk of time becoming an expert in something you don't appreciate. You can marvel at the visual beauty of a rainbow <em>and</em> be awed by the complex and delicate interplay of factors that allow it to exist.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> Edward Elric is usually a straight example but his stance is ultimately complicated.
<ul><li> He used it to justify his anti-god stance in the first story arc. "Alchemists are scientists, so we don't believe in vague things like God. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist">He hates me, incidentally.</a>"
</li><li> It's taken to one extreme in the final chapter/episode, where Ed turns <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em><strong>a marriage proposal</strong></em></span> into a discussion about the properties of alchemy, which Winry lampshades by calling him out on.
</li><li> Immediately after a baby is born, his reaction is to scream "That's awesome! LIFE IS AWESOME!!!" Instead of talking about chemicals or instincts or anything like that.
</li><li> In one of the <em>omakes</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mei Chan:</strong> Birds are so lucky...they can fly wherever they want, I wish I could be a bird. <br/><strong>Edward:</strong> A bird? That's lame. If you were a bird, you'd have flimsy hollow bones, and your brain would be the size of a pea. Not to mention the fact that you would be constantly crapping in mid-air to keep your weight down. Why would you want to be an animal like that? <br/><strong>Mei Chan:</strong> Mr. Edward, you're not very popular with girls, are you? <br/><strong>Edward:</strong> That's ridiculous! How could an <em>intellectual</em> like me not be popular!
</div></li></ul></li><li> This trope is the entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ScienceFellInLoveSoITriedToProveIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ScienceFellInLoveSoITriedToProveIt">Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove it</a></em>. Yukimura and Himuro are obsessed with quantifying everything they can, most importantly the things that make up romantic love.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba">Yotsuba&amp;!</a></em>, Asagi shows Yotsuba that the <em>tsukitsukiboushi</em> making the onomatopoetic chirps heard in late-summer are cicadas, and not summer-ending fairies as she believed. However, Yotsuba is excited to learn something new and eagerly spreads the word that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">cicadas are cicadas!</a>
</li><li> Hajime in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ICantUnderstandWhatMyHusbandIsSaying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ICantUnderstandWhatMyHusbandIsSaying">I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying</a></em> lists off the tired plot and clichés in a movie he just saw, while his wife stands there, saying she enjoyed it and is bewildered that someone would even think about stuff like that. It's semi-justified since he was going to post a review on his blog later.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SteinsGateZero">Steins;Gate 0</a></em> theme "Fatima" alternately says that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">God Is Evil</a> or that there <em>is</em> no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">God</a>, implying that both possibilities are equally depressing. It underlines the protagonist's disillusionment from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his failure to save Kurisu</span>; morality may be on his side, but causality is not.
<div class="indent"><em>A mundane universe <br/>Is overwriting all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">values</a> I know</em>

<ul><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> story had a villain steal not the intelligence, but the creativity of Reed Richards, who is regarded as one of the most intelligent men in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>. He found himself shocked to discover that he couldn't even stare at a flower without being hit by the sheer sense of wonder Richards feels at the existence of all things!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em>
<ul><li> Dr. Manhattan finds wonder in such miracles as the bonding of atoms and the formation of mountains and continents but doesn't hold any regard for life itself (mostly because he thinks he knows everything life has to offer). In fact, he only starts to love life again when he analyzes just <em>how</em> completely and utterly <em>improbable</em> (to the point of it almost being a statistical impossibility) daily life is.
</li><li> Dan Dreiburg, AKA Nite Owl II, mentions this effect in passing in one of the supplemental pieces. He found he was losing his awe for owls in studying them until a chance encounter with a hunting owl brought his fascination back.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em>: Krona's stories often involve this trope. Coupled with his trademark impatience, it has led him to stumble on disaster after disaster because, he <em>insists</em> on quantifying and qualifying everything, and is <em>especially</em> devoted to having a meaningful conversation with the sentience of the universe. The few times he's granted his wish, he is chided for his simplistic approach and rebuffed for his ignorance.
</li><li> Played with during a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> arc where Spider-Man, having temporarily lost his spider-senses, agreed to let Shang Chi train him in martial arts to compensate. Spider-Man was able to grasp the scientific aspects of Shang Chi's teaching but struggled a bit with the philosophical aspects.
<div class="indent"><strong>Spider-Man:</strong> I think I've got this. It's mass, acceleration, leverage and a knowledge of human biology. That's science, and I'm great at science. <br/><strong>Shang Chi:</strong> No, Spider-Man, it is so much more. This is no mere application of brute force. It is an art, and an expression of the self. <br/><strong>Spider-Man:</strong> What if most of myself is science?
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersMoreThanMeetsTheEye">The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye</a>:</em> The Functionist Council are a disturbed version. They and Six-of-Twelve, in particular, are of the belief that every living thing must serve a purpose, including animals and even moons, and are utterly obsessed with finding that purpose. Things that don't serve a purpose get removed or altered until they do serve a purpose.

<ul><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BC">B.C.</a></em> character (probably Thor) neatly torpedoed his own chances of getting lucky by responding to a comment on the beauty of the moon rising by saying it's an illusion caused by the Earth's rotation. Cue him shouting at the retreating Cute Chick, "BUT IT IS STILL ROMANTIC, OH SOOOO ROMANTIC!" in a futile effort to recover the magic.
</li><li> Referenced in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> arc where Andy becomes obsessed with the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic (1997)</a></em>, to the point that Roger worries about her. Jason begins describing production trivia to her ("Did you know the scenes with everyone drowning was filmed in a heated indoor pool, and their foggy breath was added by computers?" and so on). Andy accuses Jason of trying to ruin her enjoyment of the film. The final panel has Jason telling Roger, "She's onto us. Do I still get paid?"
</li><li> Parodied in an early Garfield strip. After hearing Jon's farmer brother Doc Boy explain how potato chips are made, Garfield complains that knowing where food comes from means all the magic is gone.

Slowly, it's been revealed that this is more a result of his walled-in emotional problems and history of being abused than anything else, as he displays a quite childish wonder at something so simple as realizing he has a friend.

Understanding the optics, the fluid dynamics, and all the other myriad secrets behind moments like this didn't lessen their beauty, it <em>enhanced</em> them.

</div></li><li> Many a music teacher has suggested to his or her pupils that they dedicate time to learn basic music theory, as it will help them write music. Nearly as many music teachers have been saddened to hear their students claim that they "don't want to learn a bunch of rules that [they] have to follow." This assumes that music theory is a set of rules that must be followed. When told that music theory is more a way to analyze the writing and composition of music, these pupils are usually dismissive, citing, to some degree or another, this trope. If you haven't heard of the rules, you've also never asked yourself questions such as: "Am I already following these rules? Should I be? What is each rule trying to prevent? How do people get away with breaking each rule?" Music theory is to writing music as a map is to wandering; you can still put it away and enjoy the scenery. Having one just helps you know if you're going in circles, and lets you reach places far enough away from your home that you wouldn't have stumbled upon them otherwise. What's sad is that this perception might have held back the musical talents of many <em>many</em> budding musicians.

<ul><li> The 20th anniversary edition cleared this this up, along with a lot of the other strange tonal dissonances in the original. In C20, exploring the wonders of the natural world through science and marveling at every new discovery are considered a perfectly valid source of Glamour, and Banality's creativity-stifling is a limiting force on science because it hampers technological innovation.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>: Early editions had comparatively fewer rules than later editions for character actions other than combat and spellcasting. Back then if, say, you wanted to throw your drink in a villain's face to blind him, jump from a balcony, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChandelierSwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChandelierSwing">swing on a chandelier</a>, somersault through the air, land on your feet, and run out of the room, your DM would have to figure out exactly how that would work - probably an attack roll with a small penalty, some Dexterity rolls, and a decision about whether you've generally played your character as a guy who would do that kind of thing. Now, your GM has extensive rules for how far you can jump, how far you can move, how much damage you take when you fall, what difficulty the Acrobatics check should be based on your level and if you don't have an attack power that blinds (or at least stuns or dazes) you can forget the drink-throwing having any useful effect. The new version makes everything much more standardized, predictable, easy to run, and fair, but many old-timers argue that the "rules instead of rulings" style of modern editions take all the heroism and excitement out of the game.
<ul><li> 4th Edition included a SPECIFIC list and a table, devoted to 'actions the rules don't cover'...So the GM can EASILY get a ruling for you doing cool shit. (Especially "I want to swing from a chandelier and hit them!") Unfortunately, this same table makes sure that "cool shit" will always be less effective than your default attacks, thus punishing people trying to be creative. The original DMG spelled out that players with original ideas should be "rewarded" for that with a lower chance of success.
</li><li> 5th Edition appears to be heading back into the realm of simplicity over simulationism. If you want to try a cool stunt that's not explicitly outlined in the handbook, all the DM has to do is make up his/her mind on what sort of check is necessary, how difficult it ought to be given the circumstances, and then ask you to roll it. The designers of the edition even outright advocate "rulings over rules" in social media, an inversion of the phrase grognards use to describe the newer editions that preceded it.

</li><li> The very concept of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty">"mathematical beauty"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">defies</a> this trope, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">turns it on its head</a>. People who aren't mathematically minded miss out on the beauty of something like Euler's identity, e<sup>iπ</sup>+1=0.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06yc6');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06yc6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06yc6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Think of it this way. When you start school, you learn about the number one, and about addition. Zero and multiplication come a little later. Then advance a few years and discover pi, and exponentiation. Finally, at the tail end of high school education, you learn about natural logarithms and e, and complex numbers and i. Then you discover this little identity that pulls together more than a decade of diverse mathematical studies into one essentially simple expression. That's mathematical beauty.</span>
</li><li> Physicians can be particularly passionate about their field, sitting where it does at the intersection of cutting edge technology, the frontier of science, and a deep humanitarian mission. Dr. Atul Gawande's <em>Complications</em> is an excellent introduction to just how emotional the field is.
</li><li> Computer programmers love how they take thousands of simple commands and build them into something grand. Doubly so if they work on artistic-based programming, like game design, music, or graphics/animation.
</li></ul></li><li> You needn't be an expert to get the feel for the inversion, either. Take trees: If you know next to nothing about them, you'll probably be able to distinguish two general types (evergreens and deciduous, roughly those that don't go bald in winter and those that do), and maybe pick out a couple of specific types like maple and willow. Staring at the top of a forest is just a mass of green, nothing exciting or interesting about it. But start to study trees, to recognize the distinctions, to tell them apart from up close and then from farther away, and you start to pick out the fuzzy look of the longer needles on a pine, the bendy top and airy branches of a hemlock, the color of a Colorado blue spruce, the way the branches hang on a false cedar, the way the ground is littered with distinctive cones under a Douglas fir. And that's just the conifers/evergreens. When you have that much in your head, take a look at a forest again: still just a mass of indistinguishable green?
<ul><li> Ditto if someone who's an amateur astronomer shows you a galaxy: sure, that faint smudge of light that looks as if were going to vanish in one moment or in another does not look very impressive... until he/she tells you it's an ensemble of stars so big that light needs tens of thousands of years to transverse it and its light had needed tens (if not hundreds) of millions of years through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds">intergalactic space</a> to finally reach your eye.
</li></ul></li><li> Brian Cox (the physicist, not the actor) has made a career of defying this trope, in much the same vein as Professor Sagan.
</li><li> Learning a language usually changes the way you perceive it. Some don't like how it sounds after their lessons and some come to like even more.
</li><li> Ever see a cool magic trick?
<ul><li> Some people find they are not that amusing when you figure out how they work. If you're the kind of person who legitimately enjoys magic shows, better hope you don't find yourself sitting next to that one asshole in the audience who feels the need to explain how every trick is done to you, or if he doesn't know decides to grumble and complain about how juvenile it is.
</li><li> On the other hand, some people find far more fascination in the intricacies of how the tricks are executed.
</li><li> Simple kiddie tricks may lose their awesomeness, yes, but more advanced tricks of master magicians can become even more amazing when you start to understand how much brilliance, hard work, and showmanship skill go into them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennAndTeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PennAndTeller">Penn &amp; Teller</a></em> had a show in the UK called "Fool Us." It was a competition. P&amp;T would sit in the audience and see a trick one time from the audience's point of view. They got no help. No special camera angles, no tapes to watch, and only one performance of the trick. If they could not figure out how your trick was done on a single viewing, you won a trip to Vegas and the right to open for them. The acts were all top notch, and yet maybe only one in six got past them. That did not stop them from taking almost childish joy in each performer's tricks.
<ul><li> Performer Michael Vincent, in particular - he was on the show twice, both times doing card tricks. Penn &amp; Teller figured out how he did them easily, but they still not only raved about his performances, but you can tell that they're trying (without giving away how the trick is done) to explain to the audience just how amazingly talented the man is - he may be "only" doing the real basics of magic, but he is doing them so phenomenally well that these two lifelong professionals are utterly in awe of his ability, since they know just how hard it is to do what he's doing and to make it look easy. At one point, Penn even knows exactly when and where he moves the cards to secretly get them somewhere else, and he <em>still</em> can't see him doing the move.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A playful "warning" given to new students of various design fields (interior design, graphic design, web design, etc.) is that "you will never be able to look at this field the same way again." But ask those same people about a design they genuinely like, or something that they're just stopping to stare at, and you can get several minutes of gushing.
</li><li> Paul "Hungrybear9562" Vasquez's "Double Rainbow" viral video has been subject to this, especially after it was autotuned by Songify This. As the man himself explained in multiple interviews (as well as a video response to his own video), his asking "What does it mean?" in the video was actually him seeking <em>spiritual</em> meaning in the rainbow sighting. Despite this, several science-related <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channels (and <em>dozens</em> of people commenting on his original video as well as the autotuned version) decided to "answer" his question with a detached, academic, and dry explanation on how rainbows occur.
<ul><li> Riot Games—which has several employees holding doctorates in the sciences—even got in on the marigold-measuring act with one of the "joke" lines Lux (a magician who specializes in spells involving light) says in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>. Much to Paul Vasquez's dismay, the number of people trying to explain to him how rainbows occur has gotten even <em>more</em> obnoxious than before.
</li></ul></li><li> Animators spend all day sitting at a desk, studying how a body moves, how things move, making them move, drawing hundreds of drawings. Learning how it works systematically. It doesn't make it any less enjoyable to watch cartoons being able to spot where other animators went the extra mile or made mistakes, or knowing what needs to be done to accomplish what happened.
<ul><li> Also, analyzing people's movements makes you realize just how different each person moves and how it reflects their personality, mood etc. Whereas most people would have the default assumption that "a walk is a walk," a walk in animation tells you EVERYTHING.
</li></ul></li><li> The same applies to acting, whether it's a live action role, or a voice role. How does your character walk? Does he slump forward? Does he swagger? Is he pigeon toed? Does he have a particular accent? How strong is it? Is he trying to lose it? Does he have a soft voice, or a gravelly rasp? All of these little things change who he is, and how he's perceived. It's why the school of method acting still exists. People spend months getting into, and building their idea of who the character is, <em>because it matters to them</em>.
</li><li> Film students often claim to be unable to enjoy films to a full degree because they're too busy analyzing them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoaquinPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoaquinPhoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a> commented on this shortly before the Oscars, saying that he rarely watches film anymore, due to knowing every trick and method that drives actors forward.
</li><li> Nathaniel Wyeth came from a very artistically inclined family (son of N.C., brother of Andrew and Henriette), but as an engineer he was probably the family black sheep. Nonetheless, he was pretty good at it, eventually becoming the chief engineer of the DuPont company. (Among his inventions was PET, the plastic used in <a class="urllink" href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/wyeth.html">soda bottles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.) True to his genes, he would speak eloquently about using equations the way Andrew uses brushes.
</li><li> Emile Cioran, one of the bleakest nihilistic writers of all time, once said: "Lucidity is the only vice which makes us free  free in a desert."
</li><li> Richard Feynman also was a major advocate of this style of thinking. In <em>What Do </em>You<em> Care What Other People Think?</em>, he advocates this position with an argument he had with an artist:
<div class="indent"><strong>Feynman:</strong> I have a friend who's an artist, and he sometimes takes a view which I don't agree with. He'll hold up a flower and say, "Look how beautiful it is," and I'll agree. But then he'll say, "I, as an artist, can see how beautiful a flower is. But you, as a scientist, take it all apart and it becomes dull." I think he's kind of nutty. [...] There are all kinds of interesting questions that come from a knowledge of science, which only adds to the excitement and mystery and awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.
</div></li><li> After he received stories of people disillusioned by his book <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> wrote a counter to this viewpoint in the form of <em>Unweaving The Rainbow</em>. It helped that not only did most people criticize <em>The Selfish Gene</em> purely from title alone, but those that did actually read it thought that he was endorsing a bleak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">dog-eat-dog</a> philosophy of the world<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note108m1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note108m1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note108m1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The full argument being that, as humans, we are more than our genes, i.e. even if our genes program us to be selfish we can choose otherwise</span>, despite the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">he explicitly said he wasn't doing this in the first chapter of the book</a>. He also added a preface with that message when he found out the executives behind the ENRON scandal had cited the book as an excuse for their behavior.
</li><li> David Kushner's book <em>Masters of Doom</em> has this to say about id software's John Carmack and his programming knowledge: <em>"... after so many years immersed in the science of graphics, he had achieved an almost Zen-like understanding of his craft... Rather than detaching him from the natural world, this viewpoint only made him appreciate it more deeply. "These are things I find enchanting and miraculous," he said. "I don't have to be at the Grand Canyon to appreciate the way the world works, I can see that in reflections of light in my bathroom."</em>
<ul><li> This can happen to many a game developer as their careers progress. Entering the industry with a fan appreciation, learning how it all works and forgetting how to enjoy games, and then later, learning to appreciate even more what it takes to make a game. Some of the simplest and most successful games have come from people with years of experience in the industry.
</li></ul></li><li> Stephen Hawking complained about this once: with the discovery of the "God Particle", he complained that, with lots of questions in physics revealed, it took away all the mystery.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel">Discovery Channel</a> is dedicated to measuring marigolds (some might say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">it used to be</a>), but that didn't keep them from celebrating <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=at_f98qOGY0">how awesome the world can be<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> This is one of the crux points of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualCompetitiveConflict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasualCompetitiveConflict">Casual/Competitive Conflict</a> on the Casual side. If you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">counting all the frame data and complaining about glitches being taken out instead of watching Mario beat up Sonic</a>, how can you really be enjoying the game? Competitive players will be glad to retort that their deeper understanding of the game creates a more exciting scene not just to play, but to watch as well, and can greatly increase the shelf life of a game which would otherwise stagnate.
</li><li> It is a common complaint among new film or literature students that after they've become versed in the structure and common tropes of storytelling, they can't simply <em>enjoy</em> movies or books anymore because they automatically start dissecting them. As with the magic show example given above, they feel that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspensionOfDisbelief">Suspension of Disbelief</a> has been crippled by the knowledge of how the illusions of fiction work. In fact, this phenomenon is a major part of why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TVTropesWillRuinYourLife">TV Tropes Will Ruin Your Life</a>. Also with the magic show example given above, discovering how much skill and creativity goes into creating film and literature can make the dissection part of the joy of the work. Then using that knowledge to create one's own can be an even greater joy. In fact, this phenomenon is a major part of why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/TVTropesWillEnhanceYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/TVTropesWillEnhanceYourLife">TV Tropes Will Enhance Your Life</a>.
</li><li> Some people feel like watching behind the scenes features and director's commentary on movies dismantles the magic and ruins the scenes that blew them away by showing how exactly they were achieved. Others delight in learning the stories behind the stories and the sheer craftsmanship (especially in the age of realistically achieved practical effects) involved in weaving the illusions.
</li><li> When you were a child and understood relatively little of the world around you, did you experience the emotion of wonder more often than you do now?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Cuteness</a> being explained as a biological reaction to baby-like proportions kind of takes away the appeal, but does it make them any less cute?
</li><li> Philosophy of dialogue distinguishes between two approaches to people (and some sorts of things, including nature and artworks): using and entering dialogue with. You use a thing for your own purposes, which include learning about the thing scientifically (satiating your curiosity), and you enter dialogue with it when you open yourself to what it is in itself and allow it to act on you. Both approaches are valid and necessary - the problem begins when you only use things.
</li><li> To experts in a field things that might be beautiful to the lay person might be sad or frightening. What may look like a pretty tree to the average Joe a botanist might recognize as an unhealthy specimen without much hope for recovery. A cluster of clouds and light might look breath taking to the passengers of a cruise ship but an ominous sign of an approaching storm to the crew. The inverse can also happen, where a bunch of green stems poking out of ground may be a wonderful sign to a botanist but not the layperson.
