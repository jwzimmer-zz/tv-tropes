</p><p>Two parents, who are the same race or species, are having a child. Except when the child is born, it is either racially mixed or has some other trait(s) it couldn't have possibly received from its parents. In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamasBabyPapasMaybe">Mommy had an affair and was knocked up with the cad's baby</a>.
</p><p>Even before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyDNATest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyDNATest">DNA testing</a>, this can resolve the question of whether or not the baby is the father's. If the mother is the main character, expect her to either have been raped or not know why she had a child that doesn't look like its father. In very old stories, the theory of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_impression">"maternal impression"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> may be used to explain it - either seriously, or as a way of bamboozling the putative father.

The title comes from a scene in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Life1999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Life1999">Life</a></em> where the (white) warden of an all-black prison sees his illegitimate grandson for the first time and is revolted to see that the kid is racially mixed. Then you have cases where the father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">has no idea the kid isn't his</a> when it's clear to everyone else.
</p><p>As these are sure to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthOldNewborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeMonthOldNewborn">Three Month Old Newborns</a>, expect the race to be completely obvious from birth, even though a black newborn's skin tone usually takes a while to darken.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">this can also happen</a> if both parents are of mixed race, then their hidden recessive genes can come out to the point of having a child that appears to be fully of one race. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/black-white-twins-brothers-same-mother-1C9926227">Sometimes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the infant's parents are of different races, while sometimes both parents are themselves mixed race. In one instance in the Netherlands, a white couple who underwent IVF found themselves the parents of a black infant because the lab hadn't sanitized its equipment adequately after performing an IVF procedure for a black couple. However, the old wives' tale of a white parent and a light-skinned black parent (possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HidingYourHeritage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HidingYourHeritage">passing as white</a>) producing a dark-skinned baby is quite literally one in a million.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Skin">Skin</a></em> is based on the true story of Sandra Laing, a dark-skinned girl born to white South African parents during apartheid (see Real Life, below). The film makes the point that both black and white South Africans usually have more mixed heritage than they usually admit, making racial classification far from simple. Interestingly, her father is never portrayed as questioning whether she's his daughter, but essentially disowns her when she marries a black man.
</li><li> In the comedy <em>Crazy Boys in Spain</em> (<em>Les Charlots Font l'Espagne</em>), the Charlots tried to help a white boy locate his parents at a camping site. The boy kept asking for chocolate. 4 minutes later his black parents showed up. No explanation was given.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterTheThinMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterTheThinMan">After the Thin Man</a></em>: Asta the dog, a white terrier, comes home to the missus to see she's got a litter of puppies... one of which is too darkly colored to be his. He spies a nearby black Scottish Terrier sneaking through a hole under the fence and drives off the intruder angrily, then fills in the hole.
</li><li> The Mexican movie <em>¿Qué Culpa Tiene el Niño?</em> centers around a girl from an upper-class family who gets drunk in a party and ends up pregnant, with the only suspect being a younger man named Renato. The boy accepts to marry the girl and look after the kid and the movie is about them learning to accept their differences. At the end of the movie, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the kid is Asian and looks nothing like Renato. Turns out the parent was a small Asian man who was also in the party. Renato knew he wasn't the father all along but decided to go with it because he didn't want the baby to grow without a father like he did</span>.
</li><li> In <em>Mandingo</em>, a white woman seduces (or rather, demands the sexual services of) a slave out of revenge for her husband's own infidelity with another slave. She conceives and spends her pregnancy terrified of this trope. When it comes true, she smothers the child to keep her secret, but he sees it anyway and kills her and the slave responsible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldUnseen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWorldUnseen">The World Unseen</a></em>: Amina relates that her mother was recognized to have Black ancestry when she was born, given her features and skin color differed from the Indians. This was due to her grandmother being raped by a Black man.

<ul><li> One joke about a chocolate baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">Crosses the Line Twice</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Son:</strong> Father, you and Mom are white, but I am black. Why is that so? <br/><strong>Father:</strong> Son, that was such a wild time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">just be happy you don't bark</a>.
</div></li><li> A similar one, between an African shepherd and a European priest:
<div class="indent"><strong>Shepherd:</strong> Father, I have an urgent problem to discuss with you. <br/><strong>Priest:</strong> Yes, my son? <br/><strong>Shepherd:</strong> See, my wife just gave birth to a completely white baby. You're the only white man around here! <br/><strong>Priest:</strong> Let's not jump to conclusions, my son. It might be a simple coincidence, an accident of nature. See, for example: all of your sheep are white, but the last one born is black! <br/><strong>Shepherd:</strong> <em>[lowers his voice]</em> Sheesh, okay, okay. I'll shut up about the baby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">if you'll shut up</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">about that sheep.</a>
</div></li><li> An English expectant father goes to see his newborn...who is black. As soon as he comes in, his wife screams at him, "NOW <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">try to deny you're sleeping</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">with that Nigerian woman</a>, you bastard!"
</li><li> Similar to the one above, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Dumb Blonde</a> has a c-section, and after the baby is examined and returned to them, she sees its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild">wispy red hair.</a> Horrified, she turns to her husband and gasps, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">"Oh my god! You cheated on me!"</a>
</li><li> This classic joke: An old man on his deathbed is surrounded by his family: His wife of many years, and his three sons, two of which are strong, handsome men, the third which is somewhat scrawny. As the man is breathing his last, he asks the sons to leave the room so he can talk privately to his wife. "My dear," he says, "I do not wish to pass from this world with any doubt, please tell me, for this has vexed me for many years, my third son, so unlike the other two, is he really mine? Do not lie to me as I lay dying!" The wife takes a deep breath. "I swear to you, he is truly yours." And, with that, the man dies satisfied. The wife breathes a sigh of relief. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">"Thank God he didn't ask about the other two!"</a>
</li><li> Another classic: A prince spots a humble peasant toiling in the fields and notices a startling resemblance between them.
<div class="indent"><strong>Prince:</strong> Say, did your mother ever work at the palace? <br/><strong>Peasant:</strong> No, but my father did.
</div></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkman_joke">The subject of an old joke<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: "You have the mailman's eyes."
</li><li> A traveling salesman walks up to an old farmhouse, where several sheep are wandering around outside. A little girl is sitting on the porch. She looks up at him and asks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">"Are you my da-a-a-a-a-addy?"</a>
</li><li> A woman gave birth to a black boy while her husband was away. She writes to him:
<div class="indent">"My dear. I gave birth to a boy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">However, I had lactation problems, so the baby was nursed by an Ethiopian. You won't believe it, but the baby turned black.</a>"
</div><div class="indent">The husband is amazed. He writes to his mum about that. Soon after, he receives a reply:
</div><div class="indent">"Dear son. When you were born, I, likewise, had lactation problems, and you were nursed by a cow, but it wasn't until now that you grew <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuckoldHorns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuckoldHorns">horns</a>."
</div></li><li> There is a joke about a woman who gave birth to a red-haired boy, with no one in the family having that hair color. The doctor is kind enough to help her, so he questions her husband about the frequency of his sexual life... which turns out to be low enough for him to blame it on <em>rust</em>.
</li><li> One joke about a farmer going to a divorce lawyer: The lawyer tries to find some grounds on which the farmer can leave his wife. When the lawyer asks "Is she a nagger?", the farmer replies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">"No, we're both white. But my wife had a baby recently and he's a nagger, so that's why I want a divorce".</a>
</li><li> There is a joke about a Chinese couple having a chocolate baby. They named the child <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">"Sum Ting Wong"</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0o826');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0o826" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0o826');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"something wrong"</span>. Note that the joke came way before the mess-up regarding the names of the pilots in the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 disaster.
</li><li> There is a joke where an old man marries a younger woman. Two years in a row he brings her to the birthing ward. Each time, the doctor is amazed, but the old man merely states that "I always keep the engine running". The third year, the doctor says "Well, you might want to get your oil changed, 'cause this one came out black".

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Zig-zagged in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a></em> short story "The Yellow Face." A woman gives birth to a black child, but at the time, she was essentially married to a black man, so no one questions the child's parentage. On the other hand, the child was actually a lot darker than her husband, meaning the child could have been the result of an affair anyway, but that doesn't cause anyone to think that there was something else going on: the woman tells us that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">that's common in matches like theirs</a>. The only problems the child's race causes are in the woman's later marriage to a white man, and that's mostly because she tried to conceal the fact that she had a black child.
</li><li> Played straight, but with inverted colors in the ancient Greek romance <em>Aethiopica</em> by Heliodorus of Emesa (3rd century AD): Queen Persinna of Ethiopia, wife to King Hydaspes, gives birth to a white daughter. Fearing that she will be accused of adultery, Persinna gives the girl (who is called Chariclea) away. The narrative follows Chariclea's turbulent life until, after many adventures, it is revealed that Chariclea is, in fact, the perfect image of a picture of Andromeda that her mother had been looking at while she conceived, and so Chariclea really is Hydaspes' daughter with "maternal impression" explaining her looks.
</li><li> The title story in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhumpaLahiri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JhumpaLahiri">Jhumpa Lahiri</a>'s short story collection <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterpreterOfMaladies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterpreterOfMaladies">Interpreter of Maladies</a></em> has this too. Bobby, Mrs. Das's illegitimate child with her husband's co-worker, is significantly fairer than his siblings. However, no one really guesses about Mrs. Das's infidelity just by looking at the child since she and her husband are both fair-skinned Indians.
</li><li> Arthurian legends, collected and written into a novel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChretienDeTroyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChretienDeTroyes">Chrétien de Troyes</a>, explain that Sir Yvain has a half-brother from a previous marriage when his own father took a dark-skinned Moor as a wife in Spain. Demonstrating just how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">shockingly little provincial Europeans knew about genetics</a> when interacting with people from other races... Yvain's brother has checkerboard-colored skin, with alternating light and dark patches. (Ironically, such things <em>have</em> been known to happen in real life, with mosaicism and genes that are only partially expressed, but they are extremely rare, and in any case it is clear that these northern Europeans who had rarely seen a Moor except on the battlefield <em>honestly believed</em> that this would be the result of a mixed coupling).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrivateMemoirsAndConfessionsOfAJustifiedSinner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrivateMemoirsAndConfessionsOfAJustifiedSinner">The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</a></em>, the antihero's mother spends a lot of time praying fervently with the local minister. The child resembles said minister; the author attributes it to maternal impression, but in a manner that suggests his tongue is in cheek.
</li><li> In explaining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild">Red-Headed Stepchild</a> idea, the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrisonerOfZenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrisonerOfZenda">The Prisoner of Zenda</a></em> also falls into Chocolate Baby. In the 18th century, the red-headed prince of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Ruritania</a> visited England and met the beautiful wife of a certain English nobleman. The two men fought a duel, the prince leaving the country with serious wounds and the Englishman later dying of a chill. Some months later, the wife gave birth to a red-headed child and it wasn't much of a mystery who his real father was. Thus, it's been an embarrassment to their family since then whenever someone is born with red hair.
</li><li> In the short story "Désirée's Baby" by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateChopin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateChopin">Kate Chopin</a></em>, a foundling girl who appears to be white marries, and has a baby who's obviously mixed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After her husband turns her out, Désirée apparently kills herself and the child. At the end of the story, it's revealedin a letter written by his motherthat the <em>husband</em> is the one who's mixed. He burns the letter to protect his good name.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Passing</em>, Nella Larson's exploration of black women who engage in or resist passing themselves off as white, the fear passing women have of giving birth to children who could not pass comes up in conversation.
</li><li> Jewel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AsILayDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AsILayDying">As I Lay Dying</a></em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepChild">red-haired</a> and noticeably taller than his father and brothers. It's revealed that he was the lovechild of his mother and the local minister.
</li><li> In A.B. Guthrie's novel <em>The Big Sky</em>, Boone's wife gives birth to a red-headed baby, which makes him think she cheated on him with his red-haired friend. In a rage he kills his friend, beats up and abandons his wife, and goes back home to Kentucky... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where he finds out that red hair runs in his family. Whoops.</span>
</li><li> Used in one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Outlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Outlander">Outlander</a></em> books in which Claire saves a white (also possibly married) woman's abandoned child. As a doctor, she's able to identify (despite the child being recently born) that the father was black, and strongly suspects it might have been why the child was abandoned, the setting of the novel being the mid-18th century.
</li><li> A rare 'Vanilla Baby' variant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>: King Robert Baratheon has black hair. His wife Queen Cersei, is blond, as are all three of their children. Nobody initially thinks anything of it, since there's nothing particularly strange about children resembling their mother. On closer investigation, however, <em>all</em> of Robert's illegitimate children have black hair. Furthermore, throughout history, every time a black-haired Baratheon fathered a child from a blond woman, the baby had black hair. This is used as proof that that the royal kids aren't his. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They were fathered by the queen's twin brother, Jaime.</span>
</li><li> In <em>Morpho eugenia</em> by A. S. Byatt (filmed as <em>Angels and Insects</em>), a brown-haired man married to a blonde woman has lots of blonde children that resemble their mother remarkably much and him not at all. It's not until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he finds her in bed with her brother</span> that he really sees the oddness of this.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Conqueror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Conqueror">Conqueror</a></em> books do this with eye colours — Chagatai, Ogedai, and Tolui all have the same golden eyes as their father, Genghis Khan, but Jochi, the eldest brother, has brown eyes. The fact that Borte fell pregnant with him around the time of her kidnapping doesn't help matters, and Chagatai takes great pleasure in telling everybody that Jochi is a 'Tartar bastard'.
</li><li> In <em>The Sacrifice of Tamar,</em> Tamar's grandchild is born with dark skin. Her Orthodox Jewish son is filled with righteous wrath, believing his wife cheated on him; the daughter-in-law can only cry and deny it. Then Tamar confesses to her son that he was conceived when she was raped by a black man. She never told anyone, because she had made love to her husband that same night and always hoped the baby was his.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em>:
<ul><li> Even before it was revealed that Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the kittens of Leafpool and Crowfeather</span>, everyone already knew it. None of them look anything like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedHead">Squirrelflight</a> and Brambleclaw, except for the eye color of both Squirrelflight and Hollyleaf. Squirrelflight is a ginger cat with green eyes. Brambleclaw is a brown cat with amber eyes. Jayfeather is a gray cat with blue eyes, Hollyleaf is a black cat with green eyes, and Lionblaze is a golden brown cat with amber eyes. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crowfeather is a black/gray cat with blue eyes. Leafpool is a brown cat with amber eyes. Three guesses who Jayfeather, Hollyleaf, and Lionblaze's real parents are...</span>
</li><li> There are also Oakheart and Crookedstar. They're both brown, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their parents, Shellheart and Rainflower, are gray.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Family Tree</em> by Barbara Delinsky, Clair, the wife of a man, Hugh, from a very upper-crust white family gives birth to a daughter that has caramel skin. The husband's family (except the grandmother) immediately disowns the child and the husband accuses the wife of cheating and leaves her for a short time, even though a DNA test proves that he is the father. It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the husband's family <em>supposedly</em> has black ancestry due to the rumor that the man's grandmother had an affair with her (half) black groundskeeper and became pregnant. When her son was born, he had white features and she promptly passes him off as her husband's child. The grandfather reveals the secret of the alleged affair to his son and he reconciles with his wife and daughter.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWickedYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWickedYears">The Wicked Years</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wicked">Wicked</a></em>. Elphaba's green skin is a testament to her father not being her mother's husband (although in this case potions, rather than genetics, are to blame). Her mother was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">raped</a> by a traveler when the potion he gave her knocked her out. Elphaba's father Frexspar never doubted Elphaba's parentage; he blames her skin on his failure as a preacher.
</li><li> Elphaba's younger sister Nessarose is either the daughter of Melena and her white husband Frexspar or her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedRedhead">Dark-Skinned Redhead</a> lover Turtle Heart. It's impossible to tell, though her light skin and hair point towards Frexspar. The family tree in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALionAmongMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ALionAmongMen">A Lion Among Men</a></em> confirmed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frex is her biological father</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> A rare example of a central character intentionally cheating on her (white) husband with a man of a different race comes from Andrea Levy's most popular novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallIsland">Small Island</a></em>. Also notable in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Despite his racist beliefs, her husband Bernard wants to keep the baby and raise him together.</span>
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForrestGump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForrestGump">Forrest Gump</a></em> novel ended with Jenny giving birth to one of these, lying to Forrest that it's his, and he's stupid enough to believe it. In the film, the son is white and obviously Forrest's.
</li><li> In the book <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaitingForJune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaitingForJune">Waiting For June</a></em> the white character is pregnant and everyone assumes her best friend, who is black, is the father, especially when the baby comes out black but it turns out that the father <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is Native American and the mother is half black</span>.
</li><li> In the book version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHelp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHelp">The Help</a></em> it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Constantine, an old maid that raised Skeeter, was half-white and half-black. Thus when she gave birth to a white child, she eventually had to abandon her, because people kept assuming she'd either kidnapped her or was just the babysitter.</span> Years later, the child returns and completely upsets people when they realize the truth.
</li><li> In a weird variation, one character from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGiftFromEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGiftFromEarth">A Gift From Earth</a></em> was treated like the Chocolate Baby despite having been fathered by a Crew man on a Crew woman, because the man who fathered him had <em>had testes transplants</em> from an organ-banked Colonist.
</li><li> In the epic, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JerusalemDelivered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JerusalemDelivered">Jerusalem Delivered</a></em>, Clorinda is described as pale-skinned, despite the fact that both of her parents are Ethiopians. Apparently, her mother's excessive praying to an icon of St. George caused this (as well as her exception martial skills).
</li><li> Featured in the back story of Tanis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Half-Elven</a> from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonLance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonLance">Dragon Lance</a></em> series. His elvish mother and her husband had been ambushed by human mercenaries who murdered her husband and raped her. Her royal brother-in-law was horrified when she gave birth to the clearly half-human Tanis, but still raised him as if he were family even though he constantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">faced prejudice for being half-human</a> among the generally xenophobic Qualinesti elves.
</li><li> Discussed in <em>Good Soldier Svejk</em> by Yaroslav Hasek. (Since it's set in 1914, Svejk has some odd ideas about how heredity works.)
<div class="indent">A medico who used to go to The Chalice once told us that it's not quite as simple as all that. A half-breed like that [1/4 Ethiopian, 3/4 Czech] brings half-breeds into the world again and they can't be distinguished from white people. But suddenly in a later generation, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">negro</a> turns up. Imagine the catastrophe! You might get married to a young lady. The filly is quite white and suddenly she gives birth to a negro baby.

</li><li> In <em>Sarum</em>, a Neolithic stonemason's wife gives birth to a daughter whose very long toes mark her as the offspring of his neighbor, whose own elongated toes were also inherited by the neighbor's legitimate children. Unusually, the stonemason accepts the little girl without reservation on the sensible grounds that <em>she</em> hasn't done anything wrong, but schemes to get even with his wife and her lover.

Both of the child's official parents are blond and pale, but the child has Cnaiur's darker Scylvendi features. Furthermore, all of Kellhus's actual children share his blond hair, even though <em>their</em> mother is brunette.
</li><li> Used in the short story <em>El "Clis" de Sol</em> (The "Clis" of the Sun) by Costa Rican author, Manuel González Zeledón, the story deals with a dark-skinned old man whose (also dark-skinned) young wife gave birth to two beautiful twin girls who happen to be white and blond; despite this, the old man is extremely proud of them, and when asked why his daughters are white when both him and his wife are dark-skinned, he laughs it off and says that when his wife was pregnant there was a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Clis of the Sun</a>" (solar eclipse) and she happened to be outside when it passed, so that's why they're white. When asked how he came to that conclusion, he answers that it was that young Italian teacher who was in the town several months ago who explained it to him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThornBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThornBirds">The Thorn Birds</a></em> Father Ralph notices that the oldest Cleary son Frank has black eyes, which is all but impossible given that his mother Fee has gray eyes while his father Paddy has blue. During an argument, Paddy blurts out the fact that Frank is in fact NOT his son, but the result of Fee's affair with a married Maori politician who abandoned her after she got pregnant. Ralph realizes he must have suspected this all along, as not only does Frank's eye color not match his parents or siblings, neither does his stature or coloring—short instead of tall and dark, rather than fair.
<ul><li> In the author's final novel <em>Bittersweet</em>, snide comments to this effect ("a slap of the tar brush") are made regarding youngest sister Kitty, as she has a darker skin tone than the others. Her mother turns a deaf ear to this, as despite her many flaws, she has <em>not</em> been unfaithful to her husband, but is still too snobbish and in denial to admit that either she or her husband likely has a trace of Aboriginal heritage.

It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her husband's family, whom she assumed were white, were very light-skinned African-Americans who had selectively bred themselves over generations to be light-skinned in order to pass as white.</span>
</li><li> The origin story of TJ in <em>Whale Talk</em> by Chris Crutcher. His white biological mother gave birth to a mixed-race baby (TJ) after cheating on her white boyfriend with a guy who was mixed black and Japanese. Her boyfriend left her after this proof of her infidelity and she was unable to raise the baby by herself, ultimately placing him for adoption. He's raised by two white adoptive parents in an almost entirely white community and confronts a number of racial issues during the story. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Much later in the novel, TJ tracks down the biological son of his adoptive father and proclaims 'I think we have the same father', much to the guy's surprise.</span>

Mrs. Symington receives one that claims that her red-headed son is the product of an affair, and is found dead with a suicide note shortly afterwards.

The baby is white when it's born, to the angry relief of the girl's father, but then Benton warns the girl and her mother that it's not always so obvious at first. He arranges for the girl and her newborn daughter to spend a few days in town by claiming the baby is jaundiced (which the grandfather accepts) so that if the baby's skin begins to darken, they'll be safe. It turns out the baby is white, after all, and he sends them home.

Because of this, he made up his own backstory based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Egypt">Egyptian</a> culture as he was into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">the pharaohs</a>. In an ironic twist, one of his sisters <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/facts-we-learned-from-christian-louboutin-documentary/">revealed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in a 2014 interview that his biological father was <em>indeed</em> Egyptian, whom his mother had a secret affair with.
</li><li> This was a big case in the earlier centuries of Latin American countries after the Spanish colonization with Spanish, Native Americans, and African slave mix-racing one another. However, this was a huge issue among the Natives whose wives reportedly had affairs with both Spanish and African slaves so that their children would be free from tributes and hardships, and their children would end up having white or dark skin. Given all the genetic mixing, you would think this caused headaches for offspring who had to use this trope to determine the parentage of the baby.
</li><li> Biology professors often end up in the uncomfortable situation of explaining heredity of blood types and having one student say "wait, that doesn't make any sense, my mom and dad both are O Negative and I'm A Positive, what gives?".
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Marie_Th&lt;!--C3--&gt;A9r&lt;!--C3--&gt;A8se_(The_Black_Nun_of_Moret)">Louise Marie Thérèse, The Black Nun of Moret<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, was said to be the illegitimate daughter of the Queen of France (and wife to Louis XIV), Maria Theresa of Spain.
</li><li> The first wife of Abram Gannibal, a Russian general and nobleman of African origin, was forced into the marriage and as a result, the marriage was not happy. The infidelity of Gannibal's wife came to light when she gave birth to a "vanilla baby".
