When they were removed, he did have the option to switch his avatar over to the badass knight he'd originally wanted to use, but has chosen not to. Why? Because Kuroyukihime commented that she thought the pig was cute, and now Haru has no intention of ridding himself of it. That the avatar is also small enough for Kuroyukihimi's avatar to carry him around like a pocket pet while in the virtual world is probably also a big plus in his book.
</li><li> "Chad" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> got his name when Ichigo met him, and mispronounced his real name "Sado" (the Japanese version uses "Chado").
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a></em>, the name of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">Demon Card</a> organization was originally supposed to be Demon <em>Guard</em> instead (as they were an anti-demon security force before their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>), but the original founder painted the sign the wrong way in the middle of the night and failed to notice it in time. However, the name stuck.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, Light is quickly dubbed Kira ("killer" approximated in Japanese) by the media, and decides to use that name in his dealings with others. He dislikes how it's obviously derived from "killer", but it's what the world already knows him as, so he might as well go along with it.
</li><li> The titular heroes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> got their name from reporters mishearing Ichigo's introduction of "Uh, we're from Cafe Mew Mew in Tokyo...", partially thanks to Minto, who, having some sense, muffled her to protect their secret identities.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> with Patrick Colasour. He survives getting his ass kicked by the Gundams enough that he earns the nickname "Colasour The Indestructible". He seems oblivious they're disparaging him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Kati Mannequin</a> tries to explain it to him once; apparently, he doesn't know what "disparage" means.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>, Zoro was frequently called the Pirate Hunter, as he was a bounty hunter, and pirates were the most likely people to hold bounties. But the reality was that Zoro needed their bounty money to pay for food and to repair his swords. Also, this could have easily been the epithet for any other bounty hunter.
<ul><li> Now that he's one of the most wanted pirates in the world, he's STILL called "Pirate Hunter Zoro", which doesn't really make sense considering he's, well, a pirate. Unless you consider that plenty of the people's he's fought have been <em>other pirates</em>. It's only been in his more recent incidents where he's attacked the government.
</li></ul></li><li> Jeremiah Gottwald of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> lands the nickname Orange in association with the scandal to which he was linked by Zero. Eventually he takes it as a symbol of loyalty <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> once he learns of Zero's identity and motives</span>.
</li><li> Gon, the main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a>,</em> names his Rock-Paper-Scissor (Janken) move Jajanken after he stutters on the first syllable and his opponent thinks he called it Jajanken on purpose (Jajan! as a surprise, and Janken for the rock-paper-scissors)
</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SaiunkokuMonogatari">Saiunkoku Monogatari</a>,</em> Ko Houju was called "kijin (weirdo)" as an insult. After he was rejected by a woman for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBeautifulItsACurse">too much more beautiful than herself</a>, he began wearing masks constantly and calling himself Ko Kijin, which is the name that most of the other characters of the series know him by.
</li><li> Izuku Midoriya of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em> spent his life being insulted with the nickname "Deku" (an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterReading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterReading">Alternate Character Reading</a> of his name) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerFriendOfAlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormerFriendOfAlphaBitch">childhood friend-turned-bully</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Bakugo</a>. Bakugo meant "Deku" to mean "weakling," but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">Ochaco</a>, Izuku's crush, initially interpreted it with another meaning, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">never gives up</a>"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0tkn2');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0tkn2" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0tkn2');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">from <em>dekiru</em>, which can be translated as "can do it"</span> This causes Izuku to not only like it, but even adopt "Deku" as his Hero Name.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em>, it's standard practice for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfMonsters">CCG</a> to assign an alias to unknown Ghouls. Many embrace them and start using these nicknames as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">alias</a> among their own kind as well. Perhaps the most famous example is the One-Eyed Owl, who gleefully embraced this title as their own.
</li><li> Osaka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> is named this by her classmates in lieu of her real name, Ayumu. Osaka (the place) has a reputation for being backwards.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>: Princess Hisui commented that the dragon Zirconis' hide was colored jade, and that her own name also meant jade. Zirconis decided "The Jade Dragon" had a nice ring to it, and it became his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RecordOfGrancrestWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/RecordOfGrancrestWar">Record of Grancrest War</a></em>, Theo refers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">Siluca</a> affectionately as "my witch", although witch in that setting refers to a mage that's criminal or serving Chaos. This is for two reasons; first, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse">grown up where he did</a>, Theo doesn't know much about mages outside of fairytales, and secondly, <em>mage</em> magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">is quite common and lacks mystique</a>. Witches are what do impossible feats, villainous though they are.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhVRAINS">Yu-Gi-Oh! VRAINS</a></em>: In <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Ais</a></span> final moments, he admits that despite the fact Yusaku gave him his name in a moment of laziness, he came to genuinely like it, to the point that all of the Spell and Trap Cards he uses contain puns on it.

<ul><li> The Impressionists got their name from a satirical journalist, who derived it from Monet's <em>Impression, Sunrise</em>.
</li><li> Louis Vauxcelles, a turn-of-the-20th-century French art critic, had one of the worst track records for insults in history. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEdwardianEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEdwardianEra">The Edwardian Era</a> featured the birth of a new art movement in painting, spearheaded by Henri Matisse and Georges Braque, and characterized by "wild brush work and strident colors". In 1905, upon seeing an exhibit of the works of Matisse's circle next to a statue of Donatello, Vauxcelles declared that it was "Donatello chez les fauves" ("Donatello amidst the wild beasts"). He accidentally baptized the nameless movement as "Fauvism", when the press started using it as a formal name. Several of the artists he was insulting started using the name in reference to themselves and went on to become household names. Three years later, Vauxcelles described the experimental works of Picasso and Braque as "bizarreries cubiques". Today, we call their movement cubism.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism">Pointillism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the technique of painting with small dots of color, was given this name by art critics to mock it. Once Neo-Impressionism came into full swing, which used this technique, the name lost its mocking connotation.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> got his strange name when he flubbed his own intended name, "Gold Star", along with his college football nickname "Booster", when asked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. He also gave Doomsday his name in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheDeathOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheDeathOfSuperman">The Death of Superman</a></em> when, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> caught an airborne Booster, he mentioned that "It was like Doomsday is here!" When Superman confronts him, he says "What did you call him? Oh, yeah: <em><strong>Doomsday</strong></em>."

A reporter asks Kara if she is some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a>. Later she chooses to call herself Supergirl, but she gave no indication she got her name from that random reporter.
</li><li> Modern age <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan">Plastic Man</a> got his name from flubbing "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">Elastic Man</a>", also when asked by a reporter. This is actually a retcon; when the character was created in the 40s, "plastic" was more commonly used as an adjective, before it became more commonly associated with the material "plastic" (so called because it is, of course, plastic - able to be deformed into other shapes). There is a song by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheFall">The Fall</a> called, "How I wrote Elastic man"; in one verse it says "How I wrote elastic man" and ends with "How I wrote Plastic man" Coincidence?

</li><li> The Archive is the repository of all human knowledge. Anything ever written, typed, or printed becomes part of her perfect memory. From an everyday shopping list to the current nuclear launch codes. The power is typically past from mother-to-daughter when the daughter is an adult and has a lifetime of experiences to help handle the burden of all the knowledge and past memories of the previous bearers. The current incarnation isn't like that. Her mother died soon after giving birth to the girl, not even giving her a name, out of jealousy and spite she would be able to enjoy life for a while, while the mother has to endure this power she never wanted. So, the Archive is all this girl is, until at the age of five she met Harry, who nicknamed her Ivy, and this helped her develop a small fraction of personality that would continue to grow.
</li><li> For a long time inside Harry was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">host to the Shadow of the Fallen Angel Lasciel. It was the Shadow's duty and sole mission to convince Harry to fully accept the full Fallen into his body, but Harry resists the temptation for years. As the Shadow later admits, most don't succeed in resisting for weeks. No one has ever lasted for as long as Harry has. This has left an interesting change to the Shadow who has developed into a slightly different being than the carbon copy of the True Lasciel she started as. As Harry notes, the Shadow has the same problem as Harry: his malleable human mind. She exists inside it and is just as malleable as he is. So while she could turn him evil, he could change her as well. The realization that should Harry take up the offer would mean the Shadow's demise as Lasciel would just erase the Shadow from existence. After one conversation, when discussing all the above, Harry calls her Lash. Inadvertently, this also gifted some of his own soul into the Shadow, transforming her slowing into her own unique being. When she realizes that Harry would truly rather die from a powerful mental attack rather than embrace Lasciel, Lash rebels against her master, will offer Harry any aide, any help she can without the pressure to accept Lasciel. Lash dies soon after, sacrificing her existence while shielding Harry from the mental attack</span>.

He eventually took on the shortened "Odo" as a form of identity. Secondly, he adopted the nickname "Constable" that was given to him by Kira as an appropriate if unusual title (for the time) for someone now working in station security.

The bartender called them "a bunch of revolting cocks", and sure enough, the band was newly christened The Revolting Cocks.
<ul><li> Jourgensen is particularly fond of this trope. Jourgensen's project 1,000 Homo DJs was similarly named after a comment from Wax Trax! owner Jim Nash, who said of the group's demo, "No one's gonna play this.

The title of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ministry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Ministry">Ministry</a>'s album <em>Filth Pig</em> is also lifted from a derogatory reference to Jourgensen, this time from a speech by a British MP.

</li><li> When Stan Ridgway played a friend some music he and Mark Moreland were working on for a film soundtrack, he jokingly compared the layered production to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilSpector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PhilSpector">Phil Spector</a>'s "Wall Of Sound".

</li><li> When the Yardbirds collapsed, leaving Jimmy Page as sole remaining member, he recruited three unknown musicians (they knew each other through session work) and carried on. Legal uncertainties caused them to become the New Yardbirds. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a>'s Keith Moon and John Entwistle made a remark about them going down "like a lead zeppelin". They adopted this name, changing the spelling to the familiar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> at the suggestion of their US distributor, who thought people might mispronounce (and misconstrue) "Lead" as if it were "<strong>lead</strong> a horse to water".
</li><li> According to Josh Homme, "When we were making a record in 1992, under the band Kyuss, our producer Chris Goss, he would joke and say 'You guys are like the queens of the stone age.'" And after Kyuss folded, Homme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueensOfTheStoneAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/QueensOfTheStoneAge">made good use of that joke</a>.

</li><li> In Argentina, a "grasa" is a derogatory term for someone with customs of poor people, and a "negro" is someone with a dark skin (usually from northern Argentine provinces or other South American nations). The audience of the "Malón" band organized a crowd chorus: "Baila la hinchada baila, baila de corazón, somos los negros, somos los grasas, pero conchetos no" ("dances, the crowd dances, it dances with a passion, we are the negros, we are the grasas, but socialites we are not"). The band itself liked the song so much <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDW4TV_8MTo">that they follow it with their instruments.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dismember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dismember">Dismember</a> was filed a lawsuit over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn</a> lyrics of "Skin Her Alive", calling the band "pornographic, obscene or indecent". After it was settled (in their favor), they released their next album, titled <em>Indecent and Obscene</em>.
</li><li> The name of hip hop group Jurassic 5 was originally jokingly proposed by a friend of the group, who meant to mock their old school style.
</li><li> There's an all-Asian-American rock band called the Slants, who have been embroiled in litigation for years with the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office, who refuse to register the name as a trademark because it's an ethnic slur.
</li><li> The Spice Girls' individual nicknames (Sporty, Spicy etc.) were invented by the press and only retroactively adopted by the singers themselves.

<ul><li> The term "Christian" was originally an insult. Christians originally called themselves "followers of the way", but beginning in Antioch, they were derisively called <em>Christianoi</em> ("belonging to Christ"/"slaves of Christ"), which they ended up adopting during the New Testament era.
</li><li> Mormons, originally derogatory nickname for members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, has passed into common usage, including among church members.
</li><li> Ditto for Quakers (the Society of Friends) and Santeria (Lukumi).
</li><li> Members of the Churches of Christ have consistently refused the appellation "Campbellites", but frequently accept other epithets thrown at them. One author's tract semi-famously declared "I Have A Closed Mind".
</li><li> A bit obscure, but the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing were 1) an offshoot of a Quaker group and 2) known for their use of dance during worship. They were given the nickname "Shaking Quakers", which then got abbreviated again into "Shakers".
</li><li> Likewise Methodism, which started as a Bible study/spiritual formation group led by John and Charles Wesley at Oxford and were called "Methodists" and "The Holy Club" by their fellow students.
</li><li> "Puritans" was an Elizabethan-era insult for that group; at the time they called themselves "Professors" (as in someone who 'professes' the Word).
</li><li> Adherents of Germanic reconstructionist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeoPaganism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NeoPaganism">Neo-Paganism</a> often identify as "Heathens", while adherents of some neo-pagan traditions such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wicca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wicca">Wicca</a> and Stregheria self-identify as "Witches".
</li><li> Far older than all of these is one of the original names for the Israelites: Hebrews. The word for "a Hebrew" in Hebrew is "Ivri", and one of the first times this word appears in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> is when the Pharaoh's wine steward is telling the Pharaoh about this boy Joseph that can interpret dreams. He's concerned that Pharaoh might raise him too highly, so he calls him a "na'ar eved ivri" - a boy, a slave, and an "ivri", which means a descendant of Eber, but in this case is used in the context of "across", as in "across the border", as in "foreigner". The intended insult would become one of the common names for the Israelites.
<ul><li> A few later places in the Bible imply the word to have the meaning "people living beyond the borders of society".
</li></ul></li><li> Not an insult, but the Persians called the Hebrew people in their empire (who were all originally from the Kingdom of Judah)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kaig');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1kaig" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kaig');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Kingdom of Israel having been dispersed</span> "Jews".

</li><li> Non-religious and anti-religious types occasionally (and more commonly since 9/11) adopt the title Infidels. It's also been appropriated by other non-Muslims; shirts that say "infidel" on them in both English and Arabic are a common sight in some parts.
</li><li> The term "fisheaters" was used as a derogatory term for Catholic immigrants (since they abstained from meat on Wednesdays and Fridays). However, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fisheaters.com/">a popular traditionalist Catholic site<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> bears that very name.
</li><li> "<em>Naṣrānī</em>" is an Arabic term that has been historically used by for Christians (and Westerners in general). It wasn't necessarily considered an insult since it translates to "Nazarene" (as in, followers of Jesus of Nazareth), but it became widely known after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArabSpring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheArabSpring">the fall of Mosul</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">Islamic State terrorists</a> used it as a slur against Assyrian Christians by marking their homes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarkOfShame">the word "N" in Arabic</a>. The term was adopted by Christians worldwide to raise awareness of the persecution of their fellow co-regionalists.

<ul><li> Tully Blanchard, the Anderson Brothers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> were thrown together at the last minute to fill up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a>'s tv time. The segment was well received and compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse">the Four Horsemen in the Bible</a>, so the fans began calling them <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheFourHorsemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheFourHorsemen">The Four Horsemen</a></em> of Wrestling, which the group then adopted themselves.

</li><li> Cometa Azules III was nicked named "Apache" by the trainers and students of Blue Demon's Lucha Libre school after they saw him without his mask.

To say the name stuck would be an understatement.
</li><li> Phil Mushnick, longtime sports writer for <em>TV Guide</em>, has written a number of blistering rants against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>. One of them in the '90s was aimed at wrestling <em>fans</em> in particular; Mushnick dubbed wrestling's mostly-18-to-24 fanbase "Degeneration X", lamenting the mental and moral degeneracy they must have to enjoy the product <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a> was putting out at the time. Fast forward a few months, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> formed a tag team known for lewd and sophomoric antics — and, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a> called them and their fans "degenerates", they decided to label themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX">D-Generation X</a>. Thus making their team name an example both in-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">Kayfabe</a> (Michaels and HHH appropriating the label Hart gave them) and outside of it (WWF appropriating the label Mushnick gave their fans).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Sports </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> From <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">Australian Rules Football</a>: In their early days, Richmond Football Club didn't have an official nickname. However, their colors of yellow and black inspired fan cries of "Eat 'em alive, Tigers!", and eventually the club adopted "Tigers" as their nickname.
<ul><li> The "Yellow and black!" interjection in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLNLcm7J4AY">Richmond's theme song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was also created by the fans.
</li><li> Geelong's nickname of the Cats comes from a story about a black cat crossing the ground and Geelong winning the match.
</li></ul></li><li> The history of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> has two examples of this:
<ul><li> In the late 1800s, fans of the Brooklyn Bridegrooms (seriously), were derisively referred to as Trolley Dodgers by the pre-dominantly more well-to-do fans of the archrival New York Giants, because in order to reach Bridegrooms' ballpark, it was necessary to cross a series of perilous trolley tracks. The Brooklyn fans took it as a badge of honor in a way, as did the team, adopting it as an unofficial nickname until they officially changed it to the Trolley Dodgers in 1911, then shortened it just to the Dodgers.
</li><li> Even with the new name, the Dodgers were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">consistently awful</a>, and so Brooklynites eventually came to call them "the Bums," as in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunetikAksent">Dem Bums</a> lose again?" Starting around the 1940s, though, the Dodgers actually started to get good (albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">only ever winning a World Series once</a>), but Brooklyn fans kept calling them "Dem Bums."
</li></ul></li><li> The Pittsburgh baseball team in the National League was commonly called the Alleghenys, until they signed away a player from the cross-state Philadelphia Athletics of the American Association. An A.A. official denounced their actions as "piratical", so the club decided that being known as the "Pirates" was a good way of tweaking the other league.
</li><li> Originally, the Iowa State University teams were known as the Cardinals. After the football team scored a decisive victory over Northwestern, the Chicago Tribune reported the outcome with the headline "Struck by a Cyclone." Iowa State teams have been the Cyclones ever since.
<ul><li> The <em>mascot</em> is still a cardinal (named "Cy").
</li></ul></li><li> North Carolina State University football players were once derisively described in a newspaper, following a rowdy after-game party, as having all the manners of a "pack of wolves." Fast forward a couple decades, and the official nickname of the NC State athletic program is the Wolfpack.
</li><li> In Brazilian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football</a>, the supporters of Flamengo, mostly poor and black, were called "buzzards" by rivals. Then in a 1969 game one of Flamengo's attendants threw a vulture in the field before it started, and the team eventually won, leading Flamengo's direction to adopt the vulture as their team mascot.
<ul><li> Also, Palmeiras' supporters adopted a pig as an unofficial mascot in the 1980s - but still popular enough to eclipse the parakeet that is the official one - after decades of being called "pigs" (it dates back to when "pig" was a common derogatory term for the Italians that created the team).
</li><li> The team Coritiba is usually referred as "Coxa" ("Thigh"), the team was founded by German immigrants and a common insult (especially during World War 2, where Brazil fought against Nazi Germany) was to call the players "Coxa-Branca" ("White thigh"). It's very common to the team just be called "Coxa" by supporters, rivals and neutrals alike (although the official name is still "Coritiba Foot Ball Club").
</li></ul></li><li> The 1972 Miami Dolphins got the "No-Name Defense" name given to them by Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry, who couldn't name anyone on the defensive side of the ball. The defense was number-one ranked in the league and helped the Dolphins achieve the only perfect season in the Super Bowl era.
</li><li> While in Japan, Hideki Matsui got the nickname "Godzilla" from the Japanese media because of his skin problems. His powerful bat soon took over and made it a point of pride, something which stuck around when he moved across the Pacific and joined the New York Yankees in 2003.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> nicknames sometimes are these:
<ul><li> Nick "the Goat" Thompson was once called "The Fainting Goat" because he was so easily knocked out in practice. Once he toughened up, it got shortened to "the Goat" and became an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>.
</li><li> Former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Jon "Bones" Jones received his nickname from his high school football coach because the lanky Jones was too skinny for his defensive linesman position.
</li></ul></li><li> The Tottenham Hotspur Football Club has a rather large Jewish fanbase, leading to rivals referring to their Jewish fans as "Yids". In a show of solidarity, Tottenham fans decided to take that name for all their fans, Jewish and non-Jewish. In spite of some controversy, they still refer to each other as "Yid", "Yiddo", and "Yidette", and the fanbase itself as the "Yid Army".
</li><li> The Mexican soccer club C.D. Guadalajara are often referred to as "Las Chivas del Guadalajara" (The Goats of Guadalajara) and other times as "Las Chivas Locas" (the crazy goats), to the point that a goat has become their mascot. This was started when a commentarist in a game described the playstyle of the team as "Running around like a bunch of crazy goats".
<ul><li> The name in turn was adopted by the now-defunct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueSoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MajorLeagueSoccer">Major League Soccer</a> team Chivas USA, which originally shared ownership with C.D. Guadalajara.
</li></ul></li><li> Spain's Club Atlético de Madrid adopted the moniker of "Los Indios" ("The Indians") derisively handed to them by fans of rival squad Real Madrid due to the number of South American players in Atlético's roster at the time. Further driving the point home, the team's current mascot is Indi, a raccoon with a red and white (the team's colors) Indian-like headdress.
</li><li> In American Football, Ed "Too Tall" Jones was a defensive end drafted #1 overall by the Dallas Cowboys and he would go on to become a franchise cornerstone during the team's 1970s dynasty. Standing at 6'9" (2.06m), Jones was initially considered "too tall" to play football and originally went to college on a basketball scholarship. The football coach gave him a chance, however, and Jones would move to football full time after two seasons.
</li><li> The Carolina Hurricanes of the NHL are known for having on-ice celebrations following victories, which would eventually lead to commentator Don Cherry referring to the team as a bunch of jerks. Official merchandise for the team featuring that phrase and the team logo appeared the very next day.

Curiously, the name Robotnik was used as the surname of his grandfather and cousin even in Japan, but official Japanese bios list Eggman's real name as "unknown".

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive">Legion</a> also has an Appropriated Appellation, given to him by EDI.
<div class="indent"><strong>Shepard:</strong> So what should I call you? <br/><strong>Geth Construct:</strong> Geth. <br/><strong>Shepard:</strong> No, I mean <em>you</em>.

</div></li><li> Not scorn per se, but "EDI" stands for Enhanced Defense Intelligence, simply a label of her function. As EDI's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomeARealBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomeARealBoy">character developed</a>, it just sorta... become her name.
</li><li> Partial example: when Tali <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets tried for treason</span> during her loyalty mission, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Admiralty Board legally has her ship name changed to "vas Normandy," believing that being associated with a human ship (and having a human captain represent her instead of a quarian) would hurt her chances of avoiding exile. Whether it works, backfires, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">leads in an unexpected direction</a> is up to the player</span>. Later on, if you earn Tali's loyalty, she lets the name stick.
</li><li> The term Reapers was originally bestowed by the Protheans, since they never learned the true name of their enemy. Notably, the Reapers never actually refer to <em>themselves</em> as Reapers. Harbinger occasionally uses the phrase "that which you know as 'Reapers'" to refer to their race, but this phrasing still makes it clear he doesn't consider the name valid. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Catalyst, controller and creator of the Reapers, does use the term, probably simply out of convenience, using terms that Shepard will understand.</span>
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Sovereign</strong>: <span class="asscaps">"Reaper". A label created by the Protheans to give voice to their destruction. In the end, what they chose to call us is irrelevant. We simply... are.</span>
</div><ul><li> In the second game, Legion explains that "Sovereign" was just a title used by Saren. When it communicated with the Geth, the millions of programs that comprised the Reaper instead referred to themself as "Nazara". Though, when Shepard talks to the Reaper itself, it explicitly refers to itself as Sovereign. So Legion is either lying, or it uses different names for different groups, or it's a continuity error, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">or</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">Nazara simply liked the name and took it for itself.</a>
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Sovereign:</strong>: <span class="asscaps"> There is a realm of existence so far beyond your own you cannot even imagine it. I am beyond your comprehension. I am Sovereign.</span>
</div><ul><li> The first example ever used in <em>Mass Effect</em>? Your helmsman, Jeff 'Joker' Moreau. He got the nickname in flight school for his habit of never smiling (he suffers from Osteogenesis imperfecta, which probably didn't help). He adopted the nickname after graduating, and now everyone apart from EDI (until the latter end of Mass Effect 3) and Dr Chakwas (who knows him well enough/is professional enough to stick to his real first name) uses the nickname when talking to or about him. One would think a 'morose' joke would have been too intelligent, given he becomes a wonderful barrel of snark and incidental humour.

However, there are also plenty of Black people who strongly oppose the use of the word due to its extremely negative original (and sometimes current) meaning. For slurs in general, there is ongoing debate as to whether they can truly be robbed of negative power or not.
<ul><li> Similarly, a portion of Native American population has embraced the term "Indian" rather than discourage its use. In this case, part of the appeal is perceiving it as a subtle insult towards European settlers for making the mistake of thinking they were on a completely different continent.

</li><li> If media corporations wanted to prevent people from downloading their works for free, than perhaps they should have selected a different moniker than "pirate," since many downloaders readily declared themselves pirates in order to make themselves sound like badass, swashbuckling rebels against authority. The popular torrent site Pirate Bay uses a pirate motif.
</li><li> The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was disparaged by Republicans as "Obamacare", which has since become its official nickname in mainstream news media.

By the time the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Trump administration</a> tried and failed to get rid of it, some people loved the Affordable Care Act but hated Obamacare, not realizing the two were one and the same.
</li><li> In Dutch, a name that has been 'appropriated' in this manner is called a <em>geuzennaam</em>, after the most famous example in Dutch history: the confederacy of Calvinist Dutch nobles and other malcontents, who from 1566 opposed Spanish rule in the Netherlands, called themselves <em>Geuzen</em> (singular <em>Geus</em>). This was derived from <em>Gueux</em>, French for 'beggars'. Berlaymont, one of the councilors of Margaret, Duchess of Parma, referred to the nobles as "N'ayez pas peur Madame, ce ne sont que des <em>gueux</em>" (Fear not madam, they are only beggars).

Or to quote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EBWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EBWhite">E. B. White</a>:

(Yankee Doodle rides into town on a small pony instead of a proper horse, and then sticks a random feather into his hat and declares himself stylish when in fact he's a <em>hick</em>.) The Americans took the song right along with the nickname.
</li><li> Once General Cornwallis was kicked out of Charlotte, North Carolina, he referred to the city as "a hornet's nest of rebellion". The city still has the nickname The Hornet's Nest, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalBasketballAssociation">basketball team</a> is named the Hornets.
</li><li> Edwin Eugene Aldrin Jr. picked up his (nick)name from when his sister was a toddler and called him "buzzer" as a mispronunciation of "brother". This was shortened to "Buzz", which he later made his legal first name. He is known for walking on the Moon (then, in his seventies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">he punched a guy in the face</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">saying he hadn't really been there</a>) and being the source of the name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Buzz Lightyear</a>.

They immediately reacted by calling themselves exactly that.
</li><li> Musiu Lacavalerie, late Venezuelan TV and radio personality, was born as Marco Antonio Lacavalerie, but because of his obviously non-Hispanic last name he was jokingly called "musiú" an affectionate (and then popular) term toward immigrants and foreign-looking people. Lacavalerie decided that he liked how the combination sounded, so he took it as his professional name.
</li><li> Back in the day, on our fine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fora">fora</a>, someone dropped in on a thread and prefaced their remarks with the following.

</div></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> 4th Edition was newly announced, a number of angry gamers weren't just satisfied with expressing their unhappiness and spent a lot of time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">spreading unfounded rumors</a> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WizardsOfTheCoast">Wizards of the Coast</a> boards. Other posters went out of their way to correct them and one frustrated rumormonger angrily denounced his being 'oppressed' by what he called the '4e Avengers'. Within a week, dozens of posters had that name in their sig with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> names like '4e Batman'.
</li><li> As a joke on his strained relationship with the press, then-Minnesota governor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JesseVentura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JesseVentura">Jesse Ventura</a> issued media credential badges to his press corps labeled something along the lines of "Press Jackal." The issue-ees were none too pleased, but the badges soon became collectors' items among the better-humored.
</li><li> Fans of the erotic artist Julius Zimmerman are known as the Flaming Horde after an incident in 2003. An inker was discovered to be tracing Julius' art and auctioning it as his own and fans of Julius filled his inbox full of complaints. When Julius e-mailed his image host asking who it was, the response was something like: "No one you or your horde of flaming fans need to worry about any more" and he ceased hosting the tracings. Though Flaming Horde was intended as an insult, the group embraced the novel designation.
</li><li> The astronomer Fred Hoyle, a proponent of the Steady State model of the Universe, coined the term "Big Bang" as a dismissive term for the rival model. The name was taken on by proponents of the theory, at first ironically but later in all seriousness.
</li><li> When the idea of a number line at right angles to the reals, defined by the square root of -1, was first proposed, many mathematicians considered it to be ridiculous and called them "Imaginary Numbers".
</li><li> The term "survival of the fittest" was originally used by a writer dismayed at the perceived coldness of the theory of evolution by natural selection. He meant "physically fittest", which is still a common misunderstanding today, but it was appropriated on the understanding of fittest meaning "best at its job".
</li><li> The reason why members of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful">Something Awful</a> forums are collectively referred to as "goons" by themselves and other Internet denizens.
</li><li> The "Star Wars" missile defense system was originally called that in mockery of its implausibility.
</li><li> As noted on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny">People's Republic of Tyranny</a> page, a number of left-leaning localities have been given derisive nicknames of this type, but have ended up wearing them proudly - probably because, technically speaking, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">the nicknames are so inaccurate that the only possible way one can utter them is with irony</a>.
</li><li> During a 1948 UK Labour party rally one of the party speakers derided the opposition Conservative members as 'vermin'. The Conservatives, already riding high on a wave of changing political fortunes, promptly established the 'Vermin Club' among its members, complete with custom-made chrome badges with the word 'VERMIN' prominently displayed.
</li><li> The term "Marxist" was invented by a French conservative in the late 1800s as an insult. The communists of the time quickly started referring to themselves as Marxists and their ideology as Marxism, despite Karl Marx himself detesting the term and going so far as to insist that he was not a Marxist. Admittedly, this last was more a reaction to what the ideology developed into.
</li><li> The term "suffragette" was originally coined as an insult by the British tabloid, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishNewspapers">Daily Mail</a></em>. As well as adopting it as their own, the suffragettes then turned it around by hardening the "g", emphasising the word "get".
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rats_of_Tobruk">Rats of Tobruk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Allied defenders of the besieged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> garrison who proudly took their name from Nazi propaganda. Likewise the Scrap Iron Flotilla that supplied them. Rats are intelligent, resourceful and endlessly hardy animals that will take a place over and never be removed. It was fate.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">Nazis</a> themselves. Well before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> came about, "Nazi," as a nickname for Ignaz (Ignatius) was a common epithet for the Bavarian equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOlBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOlBoy">Good Ol' Boy</a>. So when a political party called the <strong>Nati</strong>onalsozialistische<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3xh7q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3xh7q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3xh7q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the German "-ti" in <em>national</em> is pronounced <em>tsi</em></span> came to prominence, people were quick to seize on Nazi to describe it. For those unfamiliar with German culture, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a> post that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/DeadLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/DeadLink">seems to have been lost in the void of the internet</a> compared this to a hypothetical American white-supremacist party calling themselves the "<strong>Red</strong>-blooded Patriots for the <strong>Nex</strong>t America". The Nazis did briefly try reclaiming it but instead decided crushing their enemies was a better use of their energy upon taking over the German government, and so it was their enemies who made them permanently known to history as Nazis.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, Northerners took to calling Southerners "Johnny Reb" and Southerners took to calling Northerners "Billy Yank". They took to calling themselves that in jest.
</li><li> Eastern and Central European literature theorists who were developing theories set forth by Ferdinand de Saussure and Nikolai Trubietskoy were called 'structuralists' by their opponents who scorned their overly scientific methods. Later the name stuck and now the movement is officially known as structuralism.
</li><li> The terms Whig (Liberal) and Tory (Conservative), used by various British and British-derived (American, Canadian etc) political parties through the ages, both started out as fairly insulting terms in Irish Gaelic (<em>whiggamore</em> 'horse thief' and <em>toraidh</em> 'outlaw'). "Whig" fell out of use in the UK in the early 1900s, but "Tory" is still current.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Chicago">Chicago</a> is well known as "The Windy City." The nickname was around before the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893 (See the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_the_name_%22Windy_City%22">article<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>), but it was pushed into popular culture when it was used as an insult by the <em>New York Sun</em> editors to refer to the hot air being created by Chicago politicians as they tried to get the World's Fair to come to Chicago. The name stuck.
</li><li> <em>Façade</em>, Edith Sitwell's suite of poems set to music by William Walton, originally started out as a personal, technical exercise. She wanted to see if, by a careful arrangement of words, she could cause people to recite them in a particular rhythm (waltz, foxtrot, etc.). Then someone remarked that it was "very clever, but just a façade" - and she decided to let the name stick.
</li><li> Doyle Brunson, poker player, got his nickname "Texas Dolly" by Jimmy Snyder misreading "Texas Doyle". It stuck, and got shortened to "Dolly."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/RushLimbaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/RushLimbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> was once called "The Most Dangerous Man in America". Rush now calls himself that. Similarly, he and his fans refer to his fanbase as "Dittoheads", which was originally to disparage them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">yes-men</a>.
</li><li> After reclaiming the title of World Chess Champion, Mikhail Botvinnik was being fawned upon by his fans. He tried to keep the celebration restrained by telling the well-wishers, "No, no, I am not a patriarch, you know." Guess what his nickname was after that?
</li><li> Contrary to popular belief, Callsigns used by Air Force pilots (particularly combat units) are not a badge of honor. To quote former F-16 pilot Chris Kibble, "<a class="urllink" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/08/how-do-fighter-pilots-typically-earn-their-call-signs.html">They are usually based on how badly youve screwed something up, a play on your name, your personality, or just the whims of the drunken mob of pilots.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" A few examples:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>SHAG</strong> - Social Hand Grenade
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>SPIN</strong> - Shortest Pilot In NATO
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Magnet</strong> - Always flying too far from the formation.
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Krod</strong> - Read it backwards
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>FUNGUS</strong> - F**k you new guy, you suck.
</div><ul><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, Kaiser Wilhelm II referred to the British Expeditionary Force as a "contemptible little army." Immediately British army regulars started referring to themselves as the Old Contemptibles... But the quote from which the appellation was taken was fabricated by British propaganda.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">US Marines</a> call themselves "Devil Dogs", supposedly in reference to a German report referring to them as <em>Teufel Hunden</em>. The only problem is, the only sources for this claim are from the American media, and that the word would more properly be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic">Teufelshunde</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Caribbean">Indo-Caribbean people<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (Caribbean nationals who are descended from indentured servants brought from India to the Caribbean), particularly those from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Guyana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Guyana">Guyana</a> or Trinidad &amp; Tobago, are known as "Coolies." This started out as an insult by their former masters (the British plantation owners), as the original meaning was that a person being called a Coolie was a low-class worker. However, in recent decades, Indo-Caribbean people adopted it as an affectionate nickname for themselves. An Indo-Caribbean politician in Trinidad famously made a speech declaring himself to be "Coolie to the bone" to emphasize his heritage. Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce">New York City's</a> sizable Indo-Caribbean community also generally uses the word Coolie to describe themselves.
</li><li> Members of the online celebrity news community <a class="urllink" href="http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/">Oh No They Didn't!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> proudly call themselves "jackals" after being referred to as such by an online columnist.
</li><li> In the same vein, the word <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Eminem">"Stan"</a>, once used on the site as a derogatory term for overly-obsessed fans of any given subject, has now been adopted by said fans (partially due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a>) and is even used as a verb ("Who do you/I stan for _____"). This is mostly in female fanbases, popular shows, and mainstream American culture.
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> fans who actually like her and support her accept being called a "Britard".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> calling her fans "Monsters" is a double subversion. They had this name before, but due to the more questionable things they have said and done (like all fan bases), they are called "Real Monsters" to those who really don't like or get them and how they deal.
</li><li> The Crystal Palace was the purpose-built venue for Londons Great Exhibition of 1851 and a wonder of the Victorian Age, being the product of a brilliant and innovative design. Its iconic name, however, was originally coined by a writer for <em>Punch</em> magazine, as a backhanded euphemism for the proposed structure in one of their typically flippant comment pieces.
</li><li> The Chamber of Horrors in Madame Tussaud's Waxwork Museum in London acquired its name in the same manner. A <em>Punch</em> writer coined the term while commenting on the newly opened "separate room" (as it was originally referred to) in 1846.
</li><li> A large number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSeveralStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSeveralStates">US state</a> nicknames are derived from this:
<ul><li> The term "badger" for a Wisconsin resident originated as a derogatory name for the copper and iron miners in the western part of the state who, due to poverty, would sleep in holes they dug in the ground. Today, Wisconsin is officially nicknamed "The Badger State" and the athletic teams at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are known as the Badgers.
</li><li> Minnesota got the nickname "The Gopher State" when a political cartoon called Minnesotan legislators a bunch of gophers, and for some reason it stuck; to this day, the athletic teams at the flagship University of Minnesota-Twin Cities are called the Golden Gophers.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Michigan">Michigander</a>" started as a pejorative. Today, it's the only acceptable term for a person from Michigan, at least as far as Michiganders are concerned. The nickname "Wolverine State" for Michigan also began as an insult, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Ohio">Ohioans</a> called the Michiganders "vicious as wolverines" (or something to that effect) during the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo_War">Toledo War<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The term "Masshole" is used mainly to describe the perceived tendency for residents of Massachusetts to be overly aggressive about driving, sports, or things in general, but it's not uncommon to see cars with Mass plates proudly sporting bumper stickers with the word on it.
</li></ul></li><li> Jack Thompson came up with the term "pixelante," a mix of pixel and (for some reason) vigilante, to describe video game players. The GamePolitics forum wasted no time in appropriating the name for themselves, much to Thompson's annoyance.
</li><li> "Pixel-stained technopeasant" was coined by Howard Hendrix as an insult to his fellow science-fiction writers who were demeaning "the noble calling of Writer" by posting their work on the net for <em>free</em> (*gasp*). They now have <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Pixel-Stained_Technopeasant_Day">their own holiday<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Opera</a> genre was originally called that as an insult — the term "opera" was used along the same lines as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">Soap Opera</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">Horse Opera</a> to connote that a work was filled with unbelievable characters, plots, and settings. Now, the term <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">Space Opera</a> is value-neutral, and just means a work with "grand themes" that's probably on the softer end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfSciFiHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfSciFiHardness">Mohs Scale of Sci-Fi Hardness</a>.
</li><li> Fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Atlus">Atlus</a> games, particularly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> series, like using the term Fatlus to refer to themselves, despite its origins as a derogatory term.
</li><li> Lately there's been a trend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVegetarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawVegetarian">militant vegans</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblr</a> referring to omnivores as "bloodmouths" in an attempt to guilt them about their dietary choices. The omnivores' reaction? To wholeheartedly embrace it, declare "bloodmouth pride" and sometimes change usernames to incorporate the word "bloodmouth." Let's face it, if the vegans wanted to make a point, they should've chosen a term whose connotations were far less badass. They have also taken to calling them "Carnists", with similar results.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stilyagi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stilyagi">Stilyagi</a>" was the insult in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn">the Soviet Union</a> for youth who rebelled by dressing in wild styles and listening to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockAndRoll">Rock &amp; Roll</a>. They later used this name as a point of pride.
</li><li> Many people with the nickname "Bubba" got it because a sibling couldn't properly pronounce the word "brother."
</li><li> The sports teams of The Ohio State University named themselves Buckeyes after many a comment made by visiting teams about the large number of buckeye trees on campus.
</li><li> Danish show-host Bubber (real name Niels Christian Meyer) got the name from his mother mishearing her father-in-law calling him "bubbele" (doll) upon birth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MargaretThatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> was nicknamed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronLady">Iron Lady</a>" accidentally, by the Soviet newspaper <em>Red Star</em>. They tried to use the already existing, less-than-complimentary moniker "Iron Maiden", but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">it was lost in two mistranslations</a>, from and then to English. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Thatcher's response</a>: "They are right. I am an iron lady. Britain <em>needs</em> an iron lady."
</li><li> After a Rhode Island teenager named Jessica Ahlquist got a prayer banner removed from her school, one of the <em>many</em> negative reactions she suffered was a Rhode Island representative dubbing her "an evil little thing" during a radio interview. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> channel is named <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AnEvilLittleThing">"An Evil Little Thing"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Outlaw motorcycle clubs have appropriated the "1%er" appellation from an apocryphal story about how the American Motorcyclist Association said that 99% of bikers were law-abiding citizens and that only 1% of them were criminals. They take it as a badge of honor, as in they are the most hard-case 1% and everyone else on two wheels is really just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleAbidingRebel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleAbidingRebel">Rule-Abiding Rebel</a> or a wuss. These are the guys who put the grain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels">All Bikers Are Hells Angels</a>.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGildedAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGildedAge">The Gilded Age</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCartoons">political cartoonist</a> Thomas Nast started to caricature the Republican Party as an elephant — for being bloated but unstoppable (in Nast's day, the GOP ran everything that wasn't the South or New York City) — and popularized the use of the donkey to represent the Democratic Party (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AndrewJackson">Andrew Jackson</a> had been called a "jackass" in the 1830s, and as the Democrats were seen as being rather obstinate in the late 19th century, the symbol was extremely fitting). The Republicans and Democrats adopted the animals as mascots, and use them to this day.
</li><li> In the early days of baseball's American League, manager John McGraw of the Baltimore Orioles called the Philadelphia franchise a "white elephant". Manager and part-owner Connie Mack immediately had a white elephant patch sewn on the uniforms of his team, and over a century and two city changes later, the Oakland Athletics still have an elephant mascot.
</li><li> The "Crocoduck" was originally a Photoshopped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">Mix-and-Match Critter</a> used by creationists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkCameron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkCameron">Kirk Cameron</a> and Ray Comfort to mock the theory of evolution. Since then, prominent atheists like PZ Myers and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardDawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> have taken to wearing ties with crocoducks on them. Also, several fossilized animals with both crocodile and duck-like features have been found, earning them the nickname "crocoduck."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s Vice President, Spiro Agnew, once called opponents of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> "an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals". After this, some of them started wearing "Effete Snobs for Peace" buttons.
</li><li> The tiny nation of Singapore was dismissed by Indonesian President B.J. Habibie as merely a "little red dot" on the map. The Singaporean government and people almost immediately pounced on it a proud reminder that the nation has managed to prosper out of all proportion to its size.
</li><li> "Tree huggers" for environmentalists.
</li><li> Sioux City, Iowa has a problem with its airport. The FAA gave it the identifier "SUX", so every plane ticket and baggage tag would have "SUX" printed on it for anyone going there. After trying unsuccessfully to change it, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0f6or');"><sup>sort of </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0f6or" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0f6or');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">they petitioned the FAA and got back several alternatives that they liked even less</span>, the city now embraces it and sells T-shirts saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurProductSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurProductSucks">Fly SUX</a>".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Seattle">Seattle</a> features a trolley known as the South Lake Union Train. There are t-shirts for sale saying you "took a ride on the slut."
</li><li> At one point, a member of the North Carolina legislature called the famously liberal town of Asheville "a cesspool of sin." Not long after, many Asheville-based organizations, including the local NPR affiliate, began turning out "Cesspool of Sin" t-shirts. They remain quite popular among natives.
</li><li> After the 2013 protests in Turkey were described as the work of a bunch of looters ("çapulcu") and drunkards ("ayyaş") by Prime Minister Erdoğan, many supporters of the movement appropriated the terms to mock the ridiculousness of the charges. In addition to people on Facebook changing their nicknames or occupations to "çapulcu" or "ayyaş", there was also a meme involving photos showing the protesters doing harmless or constructive things (like cleaning up the streets after a clash with the police) with a caption underneath reading "Look at what those damn looters are doing". It also helps that both "ayyaş" and "çapulcu" are considered mild examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords">Inherently Funny Words</a> in Turkish.
</li><li> The name of the Crips street gang was originally the "Cribs," reflecting the members' young age, but after members began appearing in public with pimp canes, people began calling them "cripples" or "crips." The nickname stuck.
</li><li> Some inhabitants of the Isle of Sheppey in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HomeCounties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HomeCounties">Kent</a> will call themselves "Swampies," a word formerly used as a term of abuse for them. Some on the Isle still consider it an insult, so tread carefully here.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyFreeloader">"Parasite Singles"</a> was a term used to describe single Japanese people (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">single women</a>) in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LazyBum">late 20s and up who still live with their parents to live a more relaxing life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">even if said individuals are actively working to spend said earned money on themselves,</a> which is a <em>big</em> cultural no-no in Japan/Asian societies in general. Instead, the term became so beloved that it's even printed on business cards saying, "Hi, I'm a Parasite Single!"
</li><li> A young James Butler Hickok was nicknamed "Duck Bill" to make fun of his nose. After a while, he modified it to "Wild Bill" and occasionally went by William.
</li><li> The antifeminist Internet forum the Slymepit was named for a feminist nickname of the blog ERV, from which the forum was spun off.
</li><li> The creationist Michael Egnor's blog is named Egnorance, referring to a word used to mock him for his ignorance.
</li><li> The ancient Cynics were constantly called <em>kynikos</em>, or dog-like, for their asceticism and shamelessness. Eventually they took the name for their own.
</li><li> The online term "Social Justice Warrior", or "SJW", was created as a ironic pejorative term for people who often spoke negatively about sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or anything of that ilk to a tiresome extent. It was initially used to describe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">overly-PC</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Tumblr">Tumblrites</a> who had just found out what "cultural appropriation" meant and applied the term rather broadly, before expanding to become a general invective that could be yelled at anyone - possibly by people who didn't quite grasp that calling your opponents warriors for justice is basically calling them superheroes. Eventually, it was adopted as a self-descriptive term by geeky online folks with strong opinions about inclusivity and social equality, leading to a fad for replacing "warrior" with other <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> classes, and eventually <a class="urllink" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BzSuMiUIIAIclHG.jpg:large">these buttons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> being sold at conventions. Its use as a pejorative does seem to have seen a resurgence as of late, as some of the aforementioned people took it increasingly far.
<ul><li> Origin of the term may have derived from 'keyboard warrior', which was a derogatory insult to imply someone who would fight for a cause at the safety of being behind a computer screen.
</li></ul></li><li> Snowflake, being short for special snowflake. Originally this was only ever used as a term of abuse by the alt-right against people who arent openly racist or sexist or what have you, to imply that such people are against free speech and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantTakeCriticism">Can't Take Criticism</a>, but since a lot of people who used the term in that way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence">would hit the roof at the mere suggestion of someone not agreeing with them</a>, nowadays its actually more common for leftists to call the alt-right snowflakes instead. This may well be the only case of a group successfully taking a slur against them and applying it to the people who originally were using it.
</li><li> "Shitlord" was used as an insult to the kind of person against SJWs and meant sexist, homophobic, racist, etc; in just one word. The term became so overused and parodied, almost no one uses it anymore and the ones that do only call each other that as a friendly term to make fun of its lack of hurtful meaning, or (occasionally) as a sort of praise for someone who'd rather stand their ground when attacked by the aforementioned SJWs.
</li><li> Another name given by the Nazis; a group of female Russian pilots who flew nighttime missions against them were referred to as "Nachthexen" or "Night Witches" due to the whooshing sound that their biplanes made.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Otaku</a>" is not a very flattering term in Japan, but Western <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga">manga</a> fans have mostly adopted the term to refer to themselves. This can sometimes be ironic when Western Otaku sometimes use the term "Otaku" negatively when referring to Japanese Otaku (usually when complaining about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel">light novel</a> tropes or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a>), while still embracing the same word towards themselves.
<ul><li> Japanese otaku prefer to spell it as 'wotaku' (still pronounced the same) as a way to distance themselves from the negative term.
</li></ul></li><li> "Furfag" was originally an insult towards people who were a part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FurryFandom">Furry Fandom</a> due to the strong belief of the stereotype that anyone that was a furry would always have sex with other furries in the most weird and kinky way as possible. Furry fans found the term hilarious and take it as a compliment while calling each other furfags in the same way one would greet each other with the N word.
</li><li> <em>LOsstidcho</em> was a groundbreaking French Canadian theater revue created in 1968 by four young performers who would each later become well known artists. The name of the revue, which is an alteration of "lhostie dshow" (loosely translated as "the damned show"), comes from an incident during the production stage, when the theater director got exasperated and shouted: "Arrangez-vous avec votre hostie d'show!" (= "I don't want to have anymore to do with your damned show!").
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnvironmentalNarrativeGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnvironmentalNarrativeGame">Environmental Narrative Games</a> have frequently been derisively referred to by their detractors as "walking simulators", although some have since come to use that term neutrally as a purely descriptive term for the genre. It even got a shortened alternative in the phrase "walksim".
</li><li> In the early days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwoWayRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwoWayRadio">Two Way Radio</a>, Amateur Radio operators were referred to as "Hams" by professional radio operators and telegraphers, in reference to the ham-fisted and clumsy way they were perceived to operate on the radio waves. Over the years, the term was embraced by amateur radio operators so now "Ham Radio" is perceived as a perfectly acceptable and widely used name, leading to many to mistakenly assume instead that it is an acronym, spelled "HAM".
</li><li> Fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> often call themselves "Undertale Trash" for the same reasons as the "PC Master Race".
</li><li> One reason that a number of younger Americans positively identify with the term "socialism" is that they've heard conservatives deride their liberal opponents as "socialists." Most of these people, on the other hand, are <em>social</em> liberals, to the irritation of many Marxist-Leninists and anarchists.
</li><li> Brazilian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">football</a> player Paulo Henrique "Ganso" takes his nickname from how some employees in Santos F.C. called him when he was a teenager. In brazilian football slang, "Ganso" (goose) was used to describe young players who wouldn't become professionals because they lacked skill.
</li><li> The word "nerd": originally used as an insult towards science and technology oriented people, the rise of internet culture and computers becoming an omnipresent part of life has seen the word used by those formally targeted with it as a derogative turned into a badge of honor for knowledge and skill in those areas.
</li><li> <em>Bayformers</em> was originally a nickname that the detractors of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers Film Series</a> used to describe them. More recently it has been used by fans because it's not that bad of a nickname.
</li><li> The "Trixie" in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrixieMattel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrixieMattel">Trixie Mattel</a>" was an insulting nickname given to her by her stepfather early in life. She later took that and made it a part of her drag identity.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfHanover">King George III of England</a> was nicknamed "Farmer George" by the English newspapers due to his passion for agriculture (he even wrote a few pamphlets on the subject using a pseudonym, though no one was fooled). He didn't seem to mind, and the joke was never meant to be malicious. The papers changed their tone after George IV's disastrous reign: the nickname became a way of complimenting George III's frugality in comparison to his son's ridiculous extravagance.
</li><li> Originally, "Pinoy" was used as a slur against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Philippines">Filipinos</a> during the 1920s. Over the decades, Filipinos adopted and adored it as a symbol of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">Patriotic Fervor</a>.
</li><li> During the 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem">U.S. Presidential campaign</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</a> referred to some of her opponent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>'s supporters as belonging in a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_of_deplorables">"basket of deplorables"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for their open statements of racism and sexism. In response, many Trump supporters started calling themselves "Deplorables," and the Trump campaign eventually offered official merchandise branded with the word "Deplorable." In her book published after the election, Clinton admitted this may have been a factor in her loss.
</li><li> When Trump referred to Clinton in a debate as a "Nasty Woman" and to immigrants as "Bad Hombres," it inspired similarly branded merchandise from Clinton supporters who adopted those as slogans. Suffice to say, it was a contentious election.
</li><li> In the 2015 Portuguese legislative election, the pro-austerity right-wing "Portugal à Frente" (PAF) coalition managed to win reelection but without securing a supermajority. Just after they managed to get the Prime Minister appointed, Socialist Party (PS) leader António Costa managed to rally the two left most parties in the Parliament, the Communist Party (PCP) and the Left Bloc (BE), into a coalition with the PS and successfully challenged the new government and seized power. Critics looked at the apparent ramshackle and unprecedented alliance with two rather radical parties and dubbed it the "geringonça" (roughly "contraption" or "thing-a-ma-bob" in English), expecting it to collapse in less than a year. As of 2018 it's still going strong, with the Portuguese economy showing signs of recovery and the term "geringonça/contraption" has been embraced by critics, supporters, political commentators and even the government itself as a nickname for the coalition.
</li><li> Certain surnames come about like this. One example is Nimitz/Nemec and its variants. It originally came from the Polish 'ne metz' meaning 'doesn't speak,' a reference to Germans who didn't speak Polish.
</li><li> The term "glorious PC master race" was originally used sarcastically to poke fun at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCVsConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PCVsConsole">PC gaming elitists</a> (thought up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">someone who hated PCs and consoles equally</a>). PC gaming elitists took it and ran with it, now proudly using the term as they berate "console gaming peasants".
<div class="indent"><em>So bollocks to Kingdom Come, but I reserve the biggest and most suffocating bollocks for those twats I saw on the Steam discussion forums praising its obnoxious qualities and asking the devs not to change the save system because if they did, then "plebs" might get into it. Fuck you, toffee-nosed PC Master Race shitheads! I wish I'd named you something else now, like the "PC Gaming Dick-Slurp All-Stars"!</em>
</div></li><li> Manchester, New Hampshire gained the mocking title of "Manchvegas" after the city began aggressively cracking down on video poker and keno machines that did cash payouts in bars and pizza shops in the mid-1990s. Even after the city saw a major renaissance in the early 2000s following the construction of the Verizon Wireless Arena<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note49wty');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note49wty" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note49wty');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">currently the SNHU Arena</span> (as the label was also a dig at Manchester's significant lack of quality nightlife options), the name stuck and is still a widespread colloquialism used to refer to the city.
</li><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a>, the term "30 year old boomer" was created as a jab at people in this age group who still consume media from their child/teenage years. After a while, this group started to proudly call themselves boomers, making memes in which boomers show their dominance over "zoomers" AKA Generation Z, and <a class="urllink" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1072150/Hedon/">one game on Steam<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> even calls itself "boomercore" for using the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> engine and being inspired by it and other 90s FPSs.
<ul><li> Likewise, other "-oomer" appellations such as "doomer"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5bbdo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5bbdo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5bbdo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">initially referring to outwardly depressed individuals perceived as bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wangst">wangsty</a> before being used as an umbrella term for anything dark and/or cynical</span> and "coomer"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6u0bj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6u0bj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6u0bj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">initially referring to people addicted to pornography or sexual stimulation before being applied to anyone who even so much hinted at being sexually expressive</span> came to be adopted by the exact people they were intended to mock, leading to such things as the creation of "doomer" playlists centered around dark and depressing music and the use of the "coomer" character as a PFP by individuals who "fail" No Nut November (an increasingly popular online challenge, spawned from No Fap September, in which participants attempt to abstain from masturbating for the entirety of the month of November). "Coomer", however, is still a bit of an indecisive case in that, while it has been appropriated by sexually expressive individuals seeking to make fun of the label's neopuritan background (having originally been created by far-right 4chan users attempting to label sexual expression as "degenerate"), it still sees more negative reception in other areas of the internet where people spam it unironically.
</li></ul></li><li> Fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Techno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Techno">Techno</a> (which is just one of many genres under the overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic">Electronic Music</a> umbrella and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomEnragingMisconception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FandomEnragingMisconception">fans don't take kindly to anyone using the terms as if they were interchangeable</a>) have gained a reputation for being snobbish and elitist due to the genre's darker tone and more minimalistic style compared to other genres like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseMusic">House Music</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Trance">Trance</a>, leading to the term "Techno Snobs". Techno fans happily embraced the term in good humor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePresidentsOfFrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePresidentsOfFrance">French president</a> François Hollande (from 2012 to 2017) once joked in private about impoverished French people, calling them "les sans-dents" ("the no-teeth people"). That private conversation was reported in a book then in the media, and such contempt from him fuelled demonstrations against his government's austerity policies, with many protesters starting to call themselves "les sans-dents" to fire back at him.
</li><li> The official mascot of the Brazilian football club <a class="urllink" href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociedade_Esportiva_Palmeiras">Palmeiras<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a parakeet, but fans prefer a pig as their mascot and they like to call themselves pigs, eventually the club started to use both animals as mascots, even though supporters of other teams still use the pig as an insult, this comes from an expression in Brazil called "pig spirit", meaning a very nasty person, rival supporters from Corinthians gave them that name in 1969 after an incident where two of their players died in a car crash, and Palmeiras' president voted to not allow the players to be replaced in an unanimous voting.
</li><li> After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TaylorSwift">Taylor Swift</a> got embroiled in controversies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CalvinHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CalvinHarris">Calvin Harris</a> over their breakup and her claiming songwriting credit for "This Is What You Came For", and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> over Kanye's song "Famous", many of their fans took to calling Taylor a snake and spamming the comments on her Instagram account with snake emojis. Come the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Reputation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Reputation">reputation</a></em> era, Taylor turned this around and started <a class="urllink" href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/22/entertainment/taylor-swift-snakes/index.html">abundantly using snake imagery<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in her music videos and concerts.
</li><li> In the culture clash of post-fugitive-crisis Germany, the left-wing used to call the right-wing "Pack" ("scum", or something like that), to imply they aren't exactly Übermensch-compliant (poor, stupid, can't even speak German correctly etc., think of all Redneck cliches). The prompt answer was the addressees, for example, began shouting "Wir sind das Pack" on demonstrations (in parodying "Wir sind das Volk").
