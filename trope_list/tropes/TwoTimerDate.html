<ul><li> Directly referenced in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> episode where Minako tries the same. Oddly enough, the two guys are both associated villains who brag to each other about their latest catch as if they were different people. They were pretty ticked when they realized they were dating the same girl and <em>cooperated</em> against her.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiPizzaCats">Samurai Pizza Cats</a></em>, "Speedy's Double Time Trick", had Speedy try to go on a date with Lucille and Polly on the same day. It should be noted that the English-dubbed version had a slightly different twist on this trope: Speedy still tries to go on a date with Lucille, but his outing with Polly is about Al Dente asking them to transport secret documents instead.
</li><li> Found in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DNAngel">D.N.Angel</a></em>, where the protagonist and his split personality alter-ego have conflicting dates with twin girls, forcing him/them (and his family) to plan out a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to try to cover for it... using some interesting methods.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, Ryōga invites Akane over to his house, but Akari (his would-be girlfriend) shows up ahead of time. When Akane comes by, he nearly goes mad keeping them separate and unaware of the other, while going back and forth to entertain them. Ranma (Akane's fiancé) is none too pleased. Ranma specifically expresses this displeasure by dressing up (again) and pretending to be Ryōga's maid, and "helping" Ryōga with his situation.
</li><li> In Chapter 70 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiKora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiKora">Ai Kora</a></em>, Hachibe ends up on a <em>triple</em> timer date: a trip to the amusement park with Sakurako, an eating contest with Yukari, and a ballroom dancing event with Ayame. And amazingly he pulls it off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimagureOrangeRoad">Kimagure Orange Road</a></em>, Kyōsuke <em>habitually</em> goes on two-timing dates with Hikaru and Madoka. It helps that he can use his psychic powers to create distractions and teleport around. For example, while riding a roller coaster with Hikaru he teleports to his part-time job with Madoka, then teleports back and almost gets run over the roller coaster. One Christmas he even <em>rewinds time</em> so he can go to the same party with both girls (in a nutshell — first with Hikaru, then with Madoka, and then <em>both together.</em>)
</li><li> Taken to extremes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm">Carnival Phantasm</a></em>, as Shirou and Shiki have to plan around three and five commitments, respectively, complete with a huge whiteboard filled with plans, arrows and time signatures. Shiki's plan <em>starts</em> with him being in two places in exactly the same time, and gets even crazier from there. Unsurprisingly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">their plans fail miserably</a>, especially when they realize too late that each of them forgot <em>another</em> in their plan.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Is" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Is">I"s</a></em>. Ichitaka sets up a date with Itsuki, and when he's asked to support Iori at a photo shoot of hers at the same time, he initially turns her down...but later apologetically leaves his date with Itsuki when he becomes worried that something at the shoot isn't right.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/DateALive">Date A Live</a></em>: Shidou is forced into a <em>triple date</em> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Kurumi</a> (who is the priority of the date), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Tohka</a> (who somehow asked a date with Shidou), and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Origami</a> (who wants to keep Shidou safe by keeping him away from Kurumi, ironically enough). Shidou has the logistical support of Ratatoskr, including a teleportation device to help him move between the three dates. Even then, he has to pretend to go the bathroom thirty times and eat lunch three times in the same day, and Kurumi is fully aware of the triple-timing the entire time.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiInTokyo">Tenchi in Tokyo</a></em> episode, "Ryoko's Big Date", in which both Ryoko and Sakuya offered to take Tenchi out on a date in Tokyo, but Tenchi opted to go with Ryoko, after hearing her warning on his answering machine.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em>, Sonic sets up a date with Amy and a race with Sam Speed on the same day. An interesting example as he doesn't show up for either, getting preoccupied with fighting Eggman's minions instead.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/The100GirlfriendsWhoReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyLoveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/The100GirlfriendsWhoReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyLoveYou">The 100 Girlfriends Who Really Really Really Really Really Love You</a></em>. While Rentarou initially considers two-timing Karane and Hakari, he immediately realises that that would be a horrible thing to do, and simply tells them that he wants to date <em>both</em> of them.

It goes as far back as <em><a class="urllink" href="http://goldenagecomics.org/wordpress/2009/08/08/a-golden-age-love-triangle/">Archie Comics #7.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> It's pretty much impossible for a story to do this plot now without some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>.

<ul><li> Even <em>Jughead</em> has done this. Jughead, who typically refuses to go on even <em>one</em> date. Hey, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">an excuse to have two meals</a>.

Yes, it's the same job from both angles. Even he's not sure who he wants to win.

In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfSuperman">The Adventures of Superman</a></em>, Superman solved this problem by literally being in two places at once—he split himself into two bodies.

A year earlier, Doug brought home his on-again, off-again girlfriend, only to be greeted by his OTHER on-again, off-again bedmate, a flight attendant who had managed to get her schedule shifted to come to town and surprise him. Neither woman is upset, given the casual nature of their relationship and there's even a vague hint that the night culminated in a threesome.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyTies">Family Ties</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleDate">Double Date</a>" is based around Alex, this trope, and a school dance. The deception hinges on him keeping the colour of the carnation in his buttonhole straight. Alex' two dates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetroactiveRecognition">were played by</a> pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLostBoys">The Lost Boys</a></em> Jamie Gertz and pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceBalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceBalls">Spaceballs</a></em> Daphne Zuniga.

Frasier dates two women at one point, but he never forgets when he's dating each and if he accidentally schedules a date with both, he just calls one of the women to tell her he can't make it. Later, Martin dates two women on the same night and they end up talking to each other on his phone.

Adam watches various episodes with the same plot for research, only to despair when they all end in failure. Pops, who claims to have successfully done a two-timer date, helps him plan it out, only for both Emmy and Dana to find out beforehand (Dana was staying at Emmy's) and cancel the date. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They do eventually both go with Adam to the dance after he apologized.</span>
</li><li> Gary from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodnightSweetheart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GoodnightSweetheart">Goodnight Sweetheart</a></em> did this once, with the variation that the two dates were actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">decades apart</a>, but since he could only travel forward/backwards by a fixed amount of time, for him they were effectively at the same time. He tried to prevent suspicion by leaving the restaurant through the bathroom window while on the way to the time portal. This led Yvonne to wonder why he was (apparently) spending so much time in the bathroom, leading her to ask him "Are you bulimic, or pregnant?"
</li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HenryDanger">Henry Danger</a></em> episode "Henry and the Two Girls", Henry is put into this situation when he has to go to the ball with Bianca as himself and go to the ball with Cloe as Kid Danger. Ray gives him the idea to go first as Kid Danger and then pretend to be called away so he can spend the rest of the night as himself, but it doesn't work. Charlotte then gives him the idea to make up an excuse to leave for a bit so he can change into Henry to spend some time with Bianca, and leave again so he can spend time with Cloe as Kid Danger. When he asks if that would work, Charlotte responds no and lampshades that she's seen it fail on ever bad sitcom she's seen.

Played straighter in "iWon't Cancel The Show", where Spencer has scheduled his date with "sophisticated" Candice and has to do iCarly at the same time because Sam is in jail.
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KenanAndKel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KenanAndKel">Kenan &amp; Kel</a></em> had Kenan take <em>three</em> separate girls to three different movies in the same theater. In his defense, cancelling one wasn't an option because he had already failed a date with one, and the other was in a depressive mood. And the third one was Kel's fault.

Cookie then does his best to keep both his dates in separate rooms and bounce back and forth between them. He only gets found out when he tries dancing with both of them at the same time.

This backfires on him when all three of them show up simultaneously at the Max and find out the truth, resulting in them making a public announcement humiliating Ryan before storming off.
</li><li> The Season 5 episode "Liz's Choices" has a mutually-agreed-upon version of this trope. Maria and Katie drag Eric into being their date after Maria and Katie are dateless for the formal dance due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">Eric misleading them by mistake</a>, resulting in Maria and Katie being unable to find their dates due to time constraint. Eric goes to the formal with Katie, while Maria is with "Derrick" — Eric with a dread-lock wig and a different outfit. This fails when principal Mr. Belding announces for a special dance for the members of the dance committee, which Maria and Katie both are, with their respective dates. Katie and Maria start to fight over Eric/Derrick, and Eric's wig falls off (he's still in his "Derrick" outfit at the moment) in the ensuing struggle as the result, much to the embarrassment of all three of them.

Similarly, said big brother also later ends up asking twins out on a date completely by accident (he asked one girl out, and then asked her sister out thinking she was the same girl until TJ pointed it out to him), thus causing him to try and create a fake twin, only for it to unravel quickly.

Notably, this sequence is condensed into a montage that lasts less than a minute. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Twilight Sparkle, the friend in question, never quite catches on that Rarity ditched her, even as Rarity becomes increasingly exhausted and her excuses to leave start losing coherency; instead, Twilight assumes that Rarity deliberately held the birthday party in a place where Rarity could get connections, which Twilight Sparkle is very understanding about.</span>
</li><li> In "Too Many Pinkie Pies", Pinkie considers this when she's faced with choosing between helping the Apples raise a new barn and hanging out with Rainbow Dash at the swimming hole. She's convinced that this isn't an option by that the fact that it takes her at least 20 minutes to run from one to the other. Having failed to invoke this trope, she instead opts to clone herself.
</li><li> In "Triple Threat", Spike accidentally invites both Dragon Lord Ember and Changeling King Thorax to Ponyville on the same day, and fearing they might not get along tries to keep them apart and divide his time between them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> when they both quickly notice that he keeps ditching them for lame reasons and grow increasingly annoyed by his behavior.

He is of course, caught out in the end, but manages to do such a good job that they A.) are impressed that he did so well at being in both places at once and B.) pleased that he cared enough to honor his commitment to both of them.

He's not very good at it, however, and quickly gets caught. Neither of his friends is mad at him, though, and they find a way to all play together, combining their talents, since they're all friends with each other anyway.

While he's in prison, Todd calls Bojack, telling him he's landed in a "two-dates-to-the-prom" situation—the two dates being rival gangs. He asks Bojack what his character did when this plotline happened on his old sitcom. Later on, he enacts this trope.

Then, things get completely crazy when Brave Heart has him set the watch to schedule him for activities with all of the different bears and cousins, causing him to run madly between various locations.

His solution is to use the Ultimatrix, turn into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MesACrowd">Echo-Echo</a>, and create two clones, then transform back into regular Ben(s). It would have worked without a hitch, but the clone that went to the stakeout is <em>very</em> sensitive (which creeps Kevin out) and the clone that went to the tennis meet is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionWhore">Attention Whore</a> who distracts Julie from her match.

<ul><li> The Roman general Gaius Marius did this is in his last few weeks with two diplomatic delegations, feigning bouts of dysentery in order to rush from one end of his house to the other. It worked, but didn't help him much; he died quite soon afterwards and was in no real position to oppose a returning Sulla anyway.
</li><li> In one of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em> books Scott Adams gives the example of a man who had received simultaneous job offers from two firms in the same office building. He accepted both, and negotiated that he would start at 8 am in one firm and 9 am in the other. He'd go into the first firm at 8, log onto his computer and so on, then at 9 he'd claim to have a meeting, go to the other firm, log on there, work for an hour or so, then go back to the first firm... and so. In this manner, he managed to draw two paychecks for several months, until one day there was a fire alarm and he had to figure out which group of workers to stand with...
</li><li> Hyper-threading in CPUs is basically one physical core pretending to be multiple logical cores. While a few parts are duplicated, most aren't. The result is the CPU having to switch back and forth, trying to take advantage of when one of the logical cores is stalled for some reason, typically memory access.
