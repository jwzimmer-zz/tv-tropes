<div class="indent">— <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, "Family"
</div></div><p>Often in fiction, a character who starts out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan">Conveniently an Orphan</a> will pick up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">extremely loyal companions</a> along the way. Sometimes, these relationships are forged through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">fire of conflict</a>, but with Families of Choice, it's a bit different. Members of a Chosen Family mourn the lack of family in their lives and decide to build one of their own out of people they care for and who care for them in turn.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>As in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, this is most common when something has happened to these characters to isolate them from blood relatives—perhaps they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">have no family to return to</a>. Maybe they have a supernatural secret they cant share with their closest friends. They might just have a bad home life in general and decided to leave. Maybe they were, for whatever reason(s), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveNoSon">disowned or rejected by their family members.</a> To fill the vacant roles in their lives, some characters build their own families with people they choose to care about.
</p><p>Some common examples of Family of Choice include an adult meeting the future heroes as children and deciding to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> that they need, children who grow up together without family of their own and claim each other as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">brother and sister</a>, or an adult friend of a single parent that takes it upon himself to always be there for the main characters and thus becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryUncle">Honorary Uncle</a>. Adopted and blended families, however, are not examples of this trope because they <em>do</em> have legal status as family.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Examples of this trope must describe not just the nature of the relationship but how, when, or why the characters came to feel this way about each other. Remember, if they came to think of each other as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> because the plot has brought them closer together, its more likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BandOfBrothers">Band of Brothers</a>, or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> than this trope.
</p><p>Subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>. Compare/contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBloodTies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBloodTies">No Blood Ties</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">Thicker Than Water</a>. Hint: If an example includes the words "in the end" then it's more likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a> than this trope (which is about characters forming a family in the beginning, before all that plot stuff happens).
</p><p>See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsAreChosenFamilyArent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsAreChosenFamilyArent">Friends Are Chosen, Family Aren't</a>, which involves stressful family relationships which arise because a character can't choose who they are actually related to by blood. In complex cases, however, the two tropes can overlap; if things get difficult with a Family of Choice, the character can't just dump them, because they're now <em>"family"</em> — so that relationship becomes stressful.

Because +Anima are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">often the targets of discrimination, prejudice, bigotry and even sold into slavery</a>, part of the premise of the series is that our heroes are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> to find a place where they can be accepted for who they are. Through it all, they stick by each other no matter what, to the point that many times individual members of the group will reject offers to live comfortably in permanent homes all because they can't bear to part with the others.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em>, Firo, Ennis and Czeslaw — three immortals who've faced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">pretty</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy">rough</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">life</a> — eventually settle into this arrangement, right down to sharing the same apartment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> people rarely are able to reunite with their loved ones after death, since souls are usually sent to different parts of Soul Society, even if they died together. Because of this people with no blood ties tend to form family-like units to support each other.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em> there are many examples of orphaned warriors who bond with one another, growing to consider each other as real family. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion">Cowardly Lion</a> Zenitsu loves his master Jigoro Kawashima so much, that he considers the old master his real grandfather; the kindly leader of the Demon Slayer Corps, Ubuyashiki Kagaya, is so well liked by his subordinates that many see him as their father, with at least two of the highest ranking slayers, Gyomei Himejima and Muichiro Tokito, outright calling him their father.
</li><li> The guild members of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> easily qualify, especially as Makarov refers to all members as his children, and he all-but namedrops this Trope in the denouement of a rather heavy story arc.
<div class="indent"><strong>Makarov</strong>: Lucy. Though we may not be able to share our feelings of happiness or sadness entirely, we do share them to some extent. That's what happens in a Guild. One person's happiness becomes everyone's happiness. One person's anger becomes everyone's anger. And one person's tears become everyone's tears. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">There's no reason for you to feel guilty</a>, so don't cry — you should already know how much everyone here cares about you. Hold your head high, my dear, because you are a proud member of the Fairy Tail family.
</div></li><li> Despite technically all being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheClan">distantly related</a>, the Members of the Zodiac (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan">plus Tohru</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> fit this. Most of them come from broken homes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">at best</a>), and due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvoluntaryShapeshifting">condition</a>, it's a lot easier to forge bonds with each other, anyway. Tohru leaves her remaining family to stay with the Sohmas, and consequently becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">the glue that holds them together</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InuYashaTheMovieFireOnTheMysticIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InuYashaTheMovieFireOnTheMysticIsland">InuYasha the Movie: Fire on the Mystic Island </a></em>, this trope counts for six <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-demons</a> who are on an island and must be rescued. This island was once a safe home for humans and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">demons</a>, but it was destroyed by evil demons. And the six half-demons have a connection to each other as though they were all brothers and sisters, even though they are not related (although two of the boys are twin brothers). The youngest girl even addresses each half-demon as a brother or sister, simply because he or she is a half-demon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>: Kaguya has long ago written off the self-centered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkasses</a> that make up her biological family as a lost cause and instead looks towards the family of her crush Shirogane as a potential source of familial love. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This becomes especially apparent when she talks with Kashiwagi shortly after she and Shirogane start dating, and she says that she wants to be accepted as a member of their family as soon as possible.</span>
</li><li> The Yagami family in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> franchise are a borderline example, since the Knights are dependent on Hayate Yagami's mana output. The Huckebein and Grendel families in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalRecordLyricalNanohaForce">Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force</a></em> are more obvious, since both are groups of unrelated Eclipse infectees who banded together around Curren Huckebein and Kurt Grendel's leadership, respectively.
</li><li> This pretty much defines the Kobayashi household in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em> (especially the anime adaptation), with Kobayashi serving as the parent figure, Kanna (and later Ilulu) being the kids, and Tohru (who is the wife/mother of the family, but is also seen by Kanna as more of an older sister) having elements of both.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>: The White Base crew operates as a family made of the group of inexperienced soldiers and little kids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">who have developed strong friendship and relationship from battles</a>. Amuro Ray himself abandons his mother as she cannot understand his reason to fight in a war. He then abandons his workaholic father who has gone nuts because of an accident.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>: Naruto, whose entire family is dead, has formed close bonds with his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">grandfather</a>" the Third Hokage, his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">father</a>" Iruka, his "older brother" Sasuke, his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassTeacher">other father</a>" Kakashi, and, once he gets over his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovingAShadow">one-sided shallow crush</a> on her, his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">older sister</a>" Sakura. That said, the entire Leaf Village seems to regard itself as one giant extended family anyway, and their "Will of Fire" philosophy strongly emphasizes this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: This is one of the most dominant themes of the series. Oda confirmed this, stating that one of the major themes of <em>One Piece</em> is that heredity doesn't matter and family is who you choose.
<ul><li> The brothers of series protagonist Monkey D. Luffy are not related to him by blood. Luffy, Portgas D. Ace, and Sabo are all brothers by choice, having grown up together as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a> that looked out for each other. They made their brotherhood official by all sharing a cup of sake together.
</li><li> The Whitebeard Pirates. The captain looks upon each of the members as his sons, and all of them in turn looks to him as his father. It's explicitly stated that many of the members are vagabonds and strays who were brought together by Whitebeard's kindness, and all consider each other family. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As his life flashes right before his eyes, a dying Whitebeard expresses that this is all he ever really wanted.</span>
</li><li> Several members of the Straw Hats were not raised by blood relatives and had surrogate families. They have also chosen each other as their family and will move Heaven and Earth, and journey to the depths of Hell to help them. This is probably best exemplified when without a moment's hesitation Usopp, the most cowardly of the crew, follows Luffy's command to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">burn the flag of the World Government. This is an act of war and marks them as enemies forevermore to the World Government, something their companion Robin had been burdened for over twenty years and would always be betrayed by others because of this stigma. They will make the world their enemy if it is to save one friend's life</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, lesbian couple Haruka and Michiru, hermit Setsuna, and orphan Hotaru formed a family. Haruka serves as a father of sorts, while Setsuna and Michiru were the mothers of young Hotaru.

Bruce is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> for Dick, Jason, Tim, and Cass. The fact that Jason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a> complicates his relationships with everyone. There's also Barbara, who acts as a mother/big sister figure for Cass, and a big sister figure for Tim and Steph. Steph's relationship with Bruce is a deconstruction of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> role he takes with the others, as he accepted and rejected her at his convenience.

In fact the Batfamily is such a family of choice that when Damian, Bruce's biological son, shows up, he feels insecure because he's surrounded by people who were <em>chosen</em> to be Batman's family whilst he was forced on him by Talia. Of course, Damian eventually becomes a little brother to Dick and Steph. Jason and Tim too since, regardless of who's writing them, all of the Robins refer to each other as brothers as of the New 52.

Mia, in outrage, refuses and tells him she's staying with her family, and chooses to stand with the Vigil over her father</span>.
</li><li> This is explicitly the relationship between Cutter and Skywise in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> stories. They become "brothers in all but blood" when young,even going as far as to share "soul names", something normally reserved for immediate family or reproductive mates. Their relationship is somewhat strained during The Palace War and when Skywise wants to stay in the Palace after, but is never broken while they both live.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> family is this, depending on which incarnation, but particularly so with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WallyWest">Wally West</a> era. Jay Garrick, was a big-brother of sorts to Barry Allen and the two at different times acted as surrogate fathers to Wally West, while Jay and Max Mercury both acted as surrogate dads to Barry's future grandson Bart Allen. Bart, Wally, and fellow speedster Jesse Quick had something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Big Brother Mentor</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> dynamic going between them. This extends to their significant others, as Jay's wife Joan became something of a grandmother figure to the younger generation, Barry's wife Iris pretty much adopted Wally (him being her nephew already, which is how he met Barry), and Wally's wife Linda was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> to Bart and at times seemed to be the only member of the family who didn't find him annoying. Between them, the only ones actually biologically related were Barry and Bart, both of whom rarely interacted due to Barry being dead for most of Bart's existence (Wally and Iris were related, but Iris was adopted into the Wests so they're not related by blood).
<ul><li> Somewhat darkly, it seems that the second Reverse-Flash, Hunter Zolomon, AKA Zoom, <em>tried</em> to start a villainous version of this with the other Reverse-Flashes. He'd at one point took Bart's Reverse, Thaddeus Thawne/Inertia under his wing as his own 'Kid-Zoom', but he betrayed him and left him powerless. He later tried this again with Eobard Thawne, also known as Professor Zoom, the first Reverse-Flash, but when this plot resurfaced in the post <em>Rebirth</em> universe, Thawne was killed by, in self-defence, by Iris West. Hunter had an even more screwed up birth family than Wally did, so it made some degree of sense he'd want to emulate this.
</li><li> The Rogues are a considerably more successful villainous version of this, albeit only so much in the 'family' aspect than the 'villain' aspect. With Leonard Snart/Captain Cold being something of the big brother who keeps them all under control, the Rogues have gone back and fourth between being serious criminals to retiring and enjoying a friendly relationship with the Flash (particularly Wally West), but no matter what, they're almost always presented as a band of brothers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkChick">plus Golden Glider</a>) who will stick together no matter what. They even extend this to Pied Piper, Hartley Rathaway, despite him having been the only one to <em>stick</em> to the 'retiring from villainy' thing and being best friends with Wally West, but is still gladly accepted back by them any time he needs them.

They support each other in all the good ways of a family, but they're also a family in all the worst ways with all the conflicts, you'd usually suspect from living together like one. They do have some disagreements, but it always leads into more character depth. This is adapted very well in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans original animated series</a> where their family-like relationships are used to look deeper into each of the character's backstories and character flaws.

Even after years together, however, they aren't without their issues: Clint's still a tiny bit twitchy around Loki, at times, and they do have arguments, sometimes quite serious ones. Those arguments, however, are usually resolved fairly quickly and help bind them tighter. It also helps that all of them have adopted Harry as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Protectorate">Protectorate</a>: no matter their other disagreements, <em>no one</em> messes with him.

But his work partner, Roy, and Roy's wife Joanne become the people he thinks of as his family, even if he has a hard time just understanding and accepting love.

Christening her new friend "Irys", Sunset details her this trope, about how if she wanted a family, all she need do is start building from what is friendly to her, blood relation be damned. What Sunset didn't know was Irys was a kaiju in human form, an unnamed hyper gyaos who had just lost her entire flock. The rest of the gyaos flock wasn't sentient, being cannibalistic monstrosities, but it was all she had so they had a love-hate relationship. Taking Sunset Shimmer's words into practice, Irys formed a new flock with her teammates after being included into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship">Villainous Friendship</a> trio of Monster X, Gigan, and Megalon.

It's never really mentioned why, other than that they go back a way (but so does he with a few others in the fleet), and her being responsible for his son Zak's death (by not washing him out of flight training when he was failing, due to having relations with him) makes it even more perplexing.
<ul><li> One possible explanation is that he regards her as effectively being his daughter-in-law due to her relationship with Zak, and a belief that they would have married had Zak not died.

<ul><li> Giles was the closest thing any of the three main Scoobies had to a father as teenagers; this doesn't really become clear until later seasons, when we see just how distant all of their fathers are.
</li><li> Also, although the Scoobies themselves were something more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a> for the first five seasons, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the deaths of Joyce and then Buffy and Giles' absence</span> knitted them together domestically as they banded up to take care of Dawn; Willow and Tara moved in to the Summers' house and made her morning pancakes, Spike became the friendly villainous babysitter, Buffy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after she came back</span> became the hard-working mother, and Xander <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">was always there fixing the windows.</a> Seasons 6-7 definitely portrayed them as a well-oiled family unit with a home base and designated roles.

Even as an adult, Lindsay considers Voight her surrogate dad, turning to him constantly. For this reason, Lindsay is understandably upset when her mother, to whom she hasn't spoken in years, insists to her that Voight is not family and tries to reinsert herself back into her daughter's life.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>, the Study Group eventually becomes this to each other. Like the Friends entry above, several in the group come from dysfunctional families themselves or are children of divorced parents, and as such, throughout the series the entire group forms deep, family bonds to the point that the thought of losing the group completely freaks some of them (notably Jeff or Annie) out and they attempt subterfuge in a desperate ploy to keep the group together or remain a part of it. Interestingly, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> (Shirley) and closest thing they have to a father figure (Jeff) are one of the opposite-sex pairings with the <em>least</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> was described by one critic as a show about a bunch of young adults finding a replacement family for their own, dysfunctional ones. Lampshaded by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOfTheWeek">Guy of the Week</a> of Phoebe's, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorFlawMajorBreakup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorFlawMajorBreakup">minor flaw</a> was his incessant psychoanalysis of the group. There are times where actions usually performed by a family member are taken over by the gang: Chandler walks Phoebe down the aisle, Joey officiates at both Phoebe's wedding and Monica and Chandler's wedding, they all attend Rachel and Phoebe giving birth, everyone comes to Ross and Monica's grandmother's funeral, and they spend Thanksgiving together.
<ul><li> Makes complete sense when you look at their backgrounds: Phoebe's parents abandoned her while the woman she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousAdoption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousAdoption">grew up believing to be her mother</a> committed suicide, Rachel's father cut her off when she wouldn't marry the fiancé of his choosing, Joey's family disapproves of his acting career, Chandler's parents either ignore or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents">humiliate</a> him, and Monica is hurt by her parents' favouritism of Ross. To a lesser extent, Ross is also a little distant to his parents <em>because</em> of their favoritism, feeling like they have such high hopes for him, he can never live up to them. No wonder they find support in each other.
</li><li> This even upgrades to legal family when Monica and Chandler get married, making Ross and Chandler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriendsInLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestFriendsInLaw">Best Friends-in-Law</a>, and Monica and Chandler later become aunt and uncle to Ross and Rachel's daughter. Chandler and Monica even have a room for Joey in their home.
<ul><li> The cast of <em>Friends</em> could be considered as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> version, too.

<ul><li> One of the most vital aspects of Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Amphibia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Amphibia">Amphibia</a></em> is the relationship beween Anne Boonchuy and the Plantar family, whom she first sees as temporary hosts while trapped in their world, then as her "favorite frog family", and finally as <em>her family</em> period. Lampshaded by Marcy in the season 2 episode "Marcy at the Gates".

Sokka and Katara adopt Aang as part of their family in Season 1, Toph joins in Season 2, and Zuko and Suki in Season 3. Fairly unsurprising, given they all had to fend for themselves from a young age: Aang is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last of His Kind</a>, Sokka and Katara's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">mother</a> was killed when they were children and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">father</a> has been away at war for years, Toph ran away from her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">controlling parents</a>, Suki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyAbsentParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyAbsentParent">parents</a> are never even mentioned and she's separated from her fellow warriors, and Zuko suffered a childhood of abuse and indoctrination from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">father</a> and sister. They do get some support from biological guardians - notably Zuko's Uncle Iroh, and occasionally Sokka and Katara's father - but much of the time they only have each other to depend on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>: While also fitting into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">Fire-Forged Friends</a> category, the Lyoko Warriors also fit this trope, given that only one of them (Yumi) has any regular contact with their actual family, one of them (Aelita) has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> issues and two of them (Ulrich and Odd) don't get along with their actual families. The Warriors may bicker and have their moments of division but when the chips are down, they'll be there for each other. Prime examples include Jeremie's devastation when he drives Ulrich away in "Zero Gravity Zone" by mistakenly assuming he wanted to go to his soccer game instead of the mission for glory instead of getting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">dad's</a> approval, Ulrich's guilt when Odd's in a coma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret">and the last thing Ulrich said to him was insults</a> and the entire team's loyalty to Aelita. Ulrich even told off his father for insulting his friends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Kaeloo, Stumpy, Quack Quack, and Mr. Cat are a group of best friends who see each other as a family, to the extent that even Olaf (who doesn't know them that well) sometimes calls them "the little family". As for their real families, while Stumpy still has his, Quack Quack's family is dead, Mr. Cat's family was abusive so he ran away from home at a young age and nothing is known about Kaeloo's.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>: A major theme in the series is that true family are those who are with you call the way. Brothers Mako and Bolin and disgraced heiress Asami Sato have had tragic family histories that have led them to find strength in a new family with the Avatar. Mako and Bolin witnessed their parents' murder at a very young age, Asami cut ties with her father because he was affiliated with a terrorist. Later on, Mako and Bolin find the rest of their extended family who have welcomed them, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Asami reconciles with her biological father before he is killed</span>, but Team Avatar will always remain their true family. Even Korra, who presently has a good relationship with her biological family, has nonetheless settled on her teammates being her primary family. Korra also considers much of Aangs family her family. Shes particularly close to Katara and Tenzin. Korras biological <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfNoGrandparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfNoGrandparents">arent around</a> so Katara is pretty much her grandmother and Tenzin is like a second father to her. She also considers Tenzins kids to be her little siblings.
</li><li> Spike the dragon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> was hatched and raised by ponies, and doesn't know who his birth parents are.

This is in contrast to Luz's well-meaning but stern biological mother Camilla, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyForbiddingFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyForbiddingFather">who thinks Luz has to give up her weird interests to make "real" friends</a>.
</li><li> The plot of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> episode "Knuck Knuck! Who's Here?" revolves around Knuckles coming to terms with being the last echidna and his attempts to find a family of his own. At the end, he comes to realize that Team Sonic is his family.
</li><li> The Freedom Fighters of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic The Hedgehog</a></em> cartoon are clearly a tightly-knit group of friends, all of whom have lost their actual families and so turn to each other for that kind of support; Tails even considers Princess Sally his "Aunt", and she treats him very much like her own son at times. Likewise, Sonic and Tails have a very brotherly relationship.
</li><li> Sabine Wren and Hera Syndulla of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> both have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExile">complicated</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">family</a> relationships that lead them to choose the crew of the <em>Ghost</em> as their true family. While both eventually reconcile with their birth families, the crew remains their primary family.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> episode "Home Front" finally reveals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Artemis's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousPast">Mysterious Past</a>: that her parents are criminals, her mother got sent to jail and her older sister abandoned her to be raised by her abusive father as an assassin. The realization that she's found a true family in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">mentor</a> and team is what gives her the courage to risk her life saving theirs.

They were still young but had been kept together for so long that they had bonded, despite the fact that bears and tigers are often solitary. They were taken to the Noah's Ark Animal Sanctuary, where they've been kept together for 15 years. Their names are Leo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJungleBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJungleBook">Shere Khan, and Baloo</a>.
