The fight is biased in The Hero's favor and the viewer sees one of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">one-sided fights</a> the series has to offer. Pretty soon the villain is already down on one knee and The Hero is ready to use their finishing strike. The Hero prepares the attack and it looks like victory is ensured.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>But wait, what's this? Instead of performing their signature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">finishing blow</a>, The Hero has doubled-over in pain, clutching their side! What gives?
</p><p>Unfortunately, it looks like The Hero is suffering from a Game-Breaking Injury.
</p><p>A Game-Breaking Injury like this develops from damage a character had taken on in an earlier encounter, whether it be from an everyday accident or received while fighting off a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a>. The opponent will probably notice the character's weakened state and use this opportunity to turn the tide of battle. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">If they really want to ensure victory</a>, then the opponent will take every chance to aggravate the injury even more by relentlessly attacking it.
</p><p>Unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">Achilles' Heel</a>, a Game-Breaking Injury is not an intrinsic weakness as it is acquired by accident or through the opponent's doing. Sometimes the enemy in question can recognize the difference in physical ability between themselves and The Hero and will first cripple them before using their normal battle strategies. Game-Breaking Injuries do not signify the impending victory or defeat of a character; however, their presence can significantly alter the fight's outcome.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Game-Breaking Injuries can be used either as a plot device or as a means of character development. With enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">Heroic Resolve</a>, The Hero might be able to push through the pain and continue fighting. If a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam">The Team</a> is involved in this trope and he or she is of greater skill than The Big Bad, they might suffer a Game-Breaking Injury to level the playing field. Sometimes this ally is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredBadass">Retired Badass</a> who has an old war injury. If this character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMentor">The Mentor</a>, then you can bet for sure that this injury will be the cause of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorOccupationalHazard">his undoing</a>. Often a way to make it so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanBarelyStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanBarelyStand">You Can Barely Stand</a>.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, of course, especially in the sports world, where severe injuries can bench players during critical moments, not to mention end their careers and leave them crippled for life.

This can become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a> if the character never recovers. If a video game features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubsystemDamage">Subsystem Damage</a> in its gameplay, the player may be able to employ this tactic to make the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> easier.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AshitaNoJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AshitaNoJoe">Ashita no Joe</a></em> features several examples of this, but the most notable example is the punch-drunk syndrome that Joe develops in the final act of the series; despite suffering from visible loss of motor control and deteriorating senses, however, Joe tries to persevere through it during the championship fight with José Mendoza. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeroDies">It fails tragically.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has several examples of this trope.
<ul><li> In the <em>Buggy the Clown Arc</em>, Zoro was stabbed in his side by one of Buggy's floating hands right before his fight with Cabaji. The wound quickly grew in size on account of Cabaji kicking it multiple times.
</li><li> Zoro had another Game-Breaking Injury when he fought Hatchan. After being slashed in the chest by Hawk-Eeyes Mihawk, Zoro had a gaping gash on his chest as well as an incredibly high fever. Once again he was able to win in the end.
</li><li> In the <em>Don Krieg Arc</em>, Sanji was unable to win in his fight against Gin on account of taking so many hits from Pearl beforehand (due to being unable to retaliate or dodge Pearl's attacks due to Gin taking Zeff hostage). Sanji's injuries were so extensive that his body could not even withstand the impact of his own attacks.
</li><li> Another moment where Sanji suffered a Game-Breaking Injury was during the <em>Drum Island Arc</em>. After being buried by an avalanche he later helps defend the doctor who saved his life. He's unable to fight due because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">old bitch</a> hit him in the back to temporarily paralyze him and keep him from aggravating the wound.
</li><li> After using up <em>all</em> his strength defeating Rob Lucci, Luffy was so injured and exhausted that he could do nothing to protect himself from incoming cannon-fire, requiring his crew to intervene on his behalf to save him.
</li><li> Zoro recently suffered a major Game-Breaking Injury from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BearsAreBadNews">Bartholomew Kuma</a>, and in each of the two or three major encounters since the injuries have slowed him down considerably.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler">Baki the Grappler</a></em>, the title character fights Koushou Shinogi, a martial arts master who can cut nerve endings, causing certain limbs to become unresponsive. During the fight, Shinogi had managed to render Baki's entire right side useless.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HajimeNoIppo">Hajime no Ippo</a></em>, the main character has a match against Takuma Saeki, who is better known as The Speed Star. During the match, Seaki resorted to using jabs to swell up Ippo's eye so that he would be unable to see out of it then using this new blindspot as a way to help him deliver surprise attacks.
<ul><li> <em>Hajime no Ippo</em> would subvert this trope as well shortly after. Ippo injures his right fist in a training accident right before his fight with Sendo. He resorts to injecting morphine directly into the injured hand and was able to fight as normal.
</li><li> In a rare case where the Hero cripples the villain, Ippo resorts to breaking opponent Ryu Mashiba's arm during a match. Mashiba has had a history of using dirty tactics such as stepping on other boxers' toes and using his elbow to block. The later move he was employing in spades; Ippo decides instead of just avoiding Mashiba's elbow he's going to simply punch through it at the expense of injuring his own fist.
</li><li> There is also the fight of Takamura vs. David Eagle, in which Takamura gets blinded by blood flowing into his eyes. Notably, David Eagle does <em>not</em> abuse this because he is that honorable. Takamura however, is made out of different wood and soon gives David the same injury, making them both almost blind.
</li><li> In Date's rematch with Ricardo Martinez, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Date's special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">Megaton Punch</a>, the Heartbreak Shot, gets thrown twice- the first time Ricardo blocks it by sheer luck with his elbow, shattering Date's right hand. The second time he throws it, his timing and the setup are absolutely perfect and it's a straight shot to the knock-out, except the damage sustained from the first shot robs him of the power he needs to clinch it</span>.
</li><li> Many of the examples given so far are actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. It is very common for fighters to specifically attack a cut created earlier or to keep attacking a swollen eye. Legends like Roberto Duran were notoriously dirty in their fights but were experts at hiding it from the referee. Arturo Gatti once broke his hand in the middle of a fight and kept using it. Matter of fact, much of what's ever happened in boxing is sometimes too crazy to think it might have actually happened.
<ul><li> You can add Sonny Liston blinding opponents with vaseline on his gloves, boxers thumbing the eyes with their punches (less common today), and headbutting and rubbing your head in a cut.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>: Goku's suffered more than one:
<ul><li> King Piccolo damages his legs and left arm during their fight. He only lost because Goku could still use his right arm.
</li><li> Piccolo Jr. blasts a big hole clean through his right shoulder during their fight at the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament. This slows Goku down quite a bit, and Piccolo naturally makes sure to aggravate the wound by stomping on it and ramming his elbow into it. This is before he breaks both of Goku's legs and takes out his remaining arm.
</li><li> Vegeta takes it even farther than both Piccolos by breaking just about every bone in Goku's body, leaving him unable to move at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>'s Tournament of Power arc, Goku's constant use of Ultra Instinct constantly drains his stamina to the point where his body nearly gives out before he can fully ring out Jiren.
</li></ul></li><li> In the final volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka">Great Teacher Onizuka</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Onizuka is targeted by a group of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp">baseball bat-wielding</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBikersAreHellsAngels">motorcycle riders</a> who hit him in the head multiple times. What really makes this fight dramatic is that Onizuka is suffering from a brain condition in which if he suffers one more major blow to the head, he will die. The biker gang is well aware of this information</span>.
</li><li> During the fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Shishio</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, the entire cast feels this. Kenshin's been weakened to the point that he has to string multiple special moves together to even get Shishio to flinch, Saito's legs have been injured, making his signature attack useless, Sanosuke can't properly perform his special attack, and Aoshi can barely fight. Ultimately, Shishio's own Game-Breaking Injury is what does him in as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he can't regulate his body temperature following the government's attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burn him to death</a>, and after exerting himself for too long, he spontaneously combusts</span>.
<ul><li> Also averted earlier, when Saito was trying to prove to Sanosuke that he's not strong enough to help Kenshin: Saito beats him up effortlessly, bare-handed, and <em>specifically</em> avoids aiming for Sano's injured shoulder.
</li><li> Averted in Kenshin's backstory as well. Prior to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateShowdownOfUltimateDestiny">Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny</a>, his opponent had Mooks set off traps (a concussion bomb and a flash-bang) that left Kenshin deaf and nearly blind. Kenshin still managed to win the duel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> of his wife, who stepped in to block a hit that would have killed him</span>.
</li><li> This also ultimately <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ends Kenshin career as a swordsman at the end of the series. As Kenshin's fragile build can't fully withstand the pressures of his sword style which Megumi notes over time he won't be able to do anything major like he did in the past. Though Kenshin's fine with this as he wishes to settle down with Karou anyway</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a></em> early on has Spike fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Vincent in a train. Spike is an impeccably flawless fighter, but gets beaten quite badly by Vincent's equally skilled but much stronger style. Spike takes several brutal blows but continues fighting until Vincent hits him with a particularly bloody blow, at which point the fight is over: it continues for another minute or so, but it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>.
<ul><li> The climax has Spike taking a gunshot wound to the stomach right before his second fight with Vincent. For the most part, he doesn't feel it until his opponent grabs at it, which <em>immediately</em> cripples Spike, and makes the fight very one-sided, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> especially once Spike starts getting affected by the nanovirus, with the implication that he's dying.</span>
</li><li> In the series proper, in <em>Ballad of Fallen Angels</em>, Spike effortlessly takes out most of the goons in the church on his way to fight Vicious. The last mook, however, nails Spike with a gut shot, which forces his back to the wall, gasping in pain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">For five seconds</a>. And then he runs to fight Vicious.

<ul><li> The Knights were really lucky to get away with so few casualties considering A).

</li><li> Unfortunately for the Knights this was <em>not</em> the case the next time they met; Guts had spent several days recovering in a sacred spring and was packing new/reforged equipment, including the newly-reforged Dragonslayer. At least they were smart enough to run after he cleaved a few of their mounted units in half.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, Akane injures her hand while punching down a wall in exasperation. Dr. Tofu fixes it but warns her not to punch ANYTHING for a while.

Worse, she was just getting ready to defend the Tendo Dojo from <em>that same guy</em> later in the day. To add insult to injury, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">Dojo Destroyer</a> fights exclusively by wielding signs from conquered dojos as weapons, something that an uninjured Akane would have had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">very little trouble with.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GaoGaiGar">GaoGaiGar</a></em> has an odd example, in that the Game-Breaking Injury <em>was</em> the hero's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>. Every use of Hell and Heaven strains Shishioh Guy's cyborg body, eventually sending him to the emergency room several times and then warning him not to use it again lest he die. He was, naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">nearly forced to use it on the next Zonder</a>, but the Goldion Hammer was completed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustInTime">Just in Time</a>.

Edward seemed to have won by knocking it off but was stabbed in the side when it turns out <em>two</em> souls were in the armour (one controlling the head, one controlling the body). Not only was Edward exhausted, but now he was heavily losing blood, and only barely managed to win.
<ul><li> Only a few pages later, Edward was confronted with the homonculus Envy. He tried to attack, but the combination of a missing bolt and the wear-and-tear of the previous battle caused his automail arm to fail. Luckily Envy only punched him in the gut and let him live.
</li><li> Anytime Ed's Automail arm breaks or gets destroyed counts as this, as it prevents him from using Alchemy. Mind you, he's still pretty tough, and more than capable of kicking ass with only one arm, but... well, in this series, you need every advantage you can get in a fight.

<ul><li> Also, Gaara delivered a major one to Rock Lee, not only shattering his left arm and leg, but <em>pieces of the bones were embedded in his spinal column.</em> If not for Tsunade, he would have lost his ninja career, his life's dream, and probably his spirit.
</li><li> Lee came close to having it happen <em>again</em> in his fight with Gensho. The latter nearly crushed his leg bone with a cross-block.

This too would have given her clan a clear edge in the battle, but she too becomes blinded (though for her it was deliberate so she would neither have to fight Gennosuke nor be tempted to use her powers against her own clansmen) for 7 days.

<ul><li> Another example, Osada and Yoshito kicked Yuu's legs until he could not use them to support his weight. Yuu later learns to use it himself.

He does get better, but not before giving the position to Blue.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Chrono, arguably the most powerful character in the series, suffered this in the backstory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Aion</a> tore off Chrono's horns during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleStrokeBattle">Single-Stroke Battle</a>. Chrono nearly perished afterwards since demons need their horns to absorb astral power. Chrono only survived by making a contract with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mary Magdelene</span> and later Rosette, which has the consequence of draining the life of the contractor. In the present, Chrono stays in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepModeSize">Sleep-Mode Size</a> most of the time to prolong Rosette's life, though she is still doomed to die at an early age.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, this is how Jonathan Joestar met his end. Dio managed to pierce Jonathan's throat, mortally wounding him and preventing him from using his Ripple, which relies on breath control. Jonathan is still able to pull off one last Ripple. It was so weak that it couldn't even fully destroy a single zombie, but it was enough.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> has an extremely bizarre relationship with this trope through the main character Touma. It seems if an ally deals a crushing blow to him, he'll be unable to continue fighting and will fall, but if an enemy is fighting him, he can lose a whole arm and be bleeding out and still move and talk like absolutely nothing is wrong. The animation indicates he's suffering from his injuries, but he never shows any fatigue or damage from blows that would naturally kill a person until <strong>after</strong> he wins.

Multiple surgeries later, he can only use his powers for a few hours a day and needs to stay off the public eye the rest of the time, as his depowered aspect is... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkinAndBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingButSkinAndBones">disheartening</a>, to say the least.
</li><li> The one who did that to him, All For One, also suffered this in turn at All Might's hands. His face above his mouth is nothing but scar tissue, meaning he's blind. He also requires life support just to stay alive. While he's still extremely powerful, he's no longer what he was when he first fought All Might.

In his match with Jen Ni, his elbow was broken by some of Jen's thugs before the game. In the qualifying game for the God's Hand Cup, he accidentally drank some milk before the game and, being lactose intolerant, well...

In a desperate attempt to save Rick Grimes and his son, Carl, he begins wildly shooting into the crowd of zombies surrounding them, shooting Carl in the eye before being devoured by zombies. After a long while in a deep coma, Carl awakens to find that he has lost all of his recent memories and that he is incredibly crippled: blinded on his right side due to the loss of his eye. For a long time, he is ordered to stay in his house and keep the weight off of his feet, but, being Carl, that never happened. The injury begins to show permanent effects on his mental state as well, as he becomes much more hostile and bitter towards others, especially Rick, and prefers to keep it covered up. Fast forward to multiple years later, and it has been shown to still deeply affect him. He tells Rick that the faces that others give him when they see his eye hurts him emotionally, and he lectured Rick on the fact that he knew that Rick was ashamed of him for it, justifying his wanting to rescue his girlfriend, Lydia, because she is the only one that Carl has come across that did not wince each time she looked at his wound. In fact, she told Carl that it was "sexy".

He then throws a shard of metal from a ship at him, cutting his side open, taking advantage of the injury, and making it worse by slicing open the wound with an energon sword. Later on, while holding Hot Rod hostage, he shoots him in the same wound and also in the chest and face fatally wounding him, but just before he passes out he manages to knock Megatron off a cliff, severely wounding him. The damage inflicted on Megatron in the battle is so severe that he cannot defend himself from Starscream's treachery the way he usually does when Starscream tosses him into space on the way back to Cybertron.

<ul><li> Submission artists employ this tactic all the time. They will use a variety of locks and holds that target a specific part of the human body until it becomes too painful to use. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> is very good at selling this trope, often to the point of setting up his finisher only to stop because his knee or foot collapses in pain.
</li><li> A variation of this is when a wrestler (almost always a face) is injured days (or even weeks) before the match begins and is clearly not 100%. The heel will then target that particular body part in the hopes of permanently damaging that foe to the point that they can't continue. This happened A LOT with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DwayneJohnson">the Rock</a> for some reason.

</li><li> Some matches have a high tendency to cause this, especially the scaffold match.

Characters who specialized in the <em>submission</em> fighting style were able to target their opponents' limbs, and their overall durability was represented by a separate life meter. If the opposing player used a weakened limb to punch or kick, then the damage would <strong>greatly</strong> be reduced. These mechanics are likewise carried over into the <em>Kurohyō</em> spin-offs of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza">[1]</a></em> series, developed by the same company responsible for the original Def Jam and its Fight for New York sequel.

The latter is on his knees, having taken a nasty blow to the side, when suddenly his eyes and weapon come alive with a holy fire. The Chaos warrior just cocks his head and knees him in the injured side.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a></em>, getting wounded slows you down and decreases your aim accuracy.

For example, broken arms can leave someone unable to wield weapons or shields, a severed motor nerve in the leg can leave someone unable to stand, eye injuries cause blindness, etc. Fortunately, multiple weapons and shields can be equipped to the same hand, and crutches can be used to regain standing ability, albeit at the cost of a speed penalty.

<ul><li> Fans have theorized that Artorias' injury is the only thing that makes him feasibly beatable by players. Fighting him with a functional shield arm and his darkness-nullifying shield <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">would probably be even more one-sided</a>.

Kratos had just turned himself into a mortal again by feeding all of his godly power into the Blade. Then Zeus appears to reclaim the Blade and slay Kratos since the entire struggle in Rhodes was a scheme to preemptively remove any threat Kratos might pose to Olympus. Kratos tries to fight back — but since he was nearly <em>crushed to death by a huge statue</em> seconds ago, he's in pretty bad shape. He's limping, unable to jump or run, and he can barely swing his blades.

Sephiroth was distracted meeting his "mother" Jenova, giving Cloud the opportunity to impale him <em>and</em> Jenova from behind with the Buster Sword. Sephiroth still had the strength to impale Cloud in turn, but his injury left him too weak to resist when Cloud used his own sword as leverage to hurl Sephiroth into the chamber's wall. The exploding machinery in the wall did the rest of the job, and the dying Sephiroth fell into the Lifestream. It took Sephiroth years to recover from what Cloud did to him, and he had to create a new body using Jenova cells to do it — his own original body was beyond saving.

Punching in the next Chapter will cause him to recoil in pain, he can't run and climbing it out of the question. Nate's back to normal by the time he starts the next level, though.

The injury actually did keep her out of the trials, but the committee ended up deciding, based on her past performance, to give her a spot anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> In professional hockey, teams worry that opposing players will deliberately target an injured player's weak spots and so they give injury information in the vaguest possible terms. An "Upper Body Injury" can be anything from a broken arm to a sinus infection to a concussion. During the 2020 playoffs, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, even those descriptions were done away with in favor of describing all players who cannot play at the moment only as "unfit to participate", inadvertently invoking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier">Nothing Is Scarier</a> trope.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in the case of Bobby Baun of the Toronto Maple Leafs. In game six of the Stanley Cup Finals, Baun, who broke his ankle earlier in the game, skated on for the overtime and scored the game-winning goal. This would propel the Leafs into a game 7 Stanley Cup victory over their opponents (Baun also played in that game as well).
</li></ul></li><li> The Minnesota Vikings' Ron Yary was notorious for playing in spite of injuries, particularly the occasion in the 1981 season where he played with a <em>broken foot</em>. Not that this managed to affect his performance at all...
</li><li> Brett Favre, whose noted "Ironman Streak" of Most Consecutive Starts at any non-special teams <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalFootballLeague">NFL</a> position (297 regular season; 321 including postseason) involved both injured and broken throwing-hand bones and ankles.
</li><li> The Dallas Cowboys' Rayfield Wright came into the 1975 season with a weak knee and managed to shake the most powerful defensive ends in the league regardless.
</li><li> Jack Youngblood of the Los Angeles Rams actually played every single play on defense during Super Bowl XIV against the all-powerful Pittsburgh Steelers with a taped-up broken leg. Considering that it was the Rams' first title game appearance in years, it was probably justifiable, as there is was no way he was going to miss the most important game of his life. Not only that, he played in the Pro Bowl that year too.
</li><li> Bill Buckner was actually off the field for much of the sixth game of the 1986 world series, because of his severely injured knees. Manager John McNamara reportedly sent him out because he thought Buckner deserved to be on the field for the Sox series win... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverLiveItDown/Sports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/NeverLiveItDown/Sports">Whoops</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AudreyHepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> actually wanted to be a ballet dancer, not an actor. She trained as a child but had to give it up as she entered her teens because she, well, lived in Nazi-occupied Holland. She and her family went through extended periods of starvation during the occupation which stunted her metabolism and weakened her bones. When the war ended, she tried to pick it back up again but she just physically couldnt do it. She struggled with the toll her formative years took on her body for the rest of her life and contributed to her relatively early death at 63.
</li><li> Normally, a torn ACL and a fractured tibia would be <em>two</em> of these. Tiger Woods won the 2008 U.S. Open on a leg with <em>both</em>. No small feat in professional golf, where you're required to walk four miles a day for four days (and he had to stretch it to a fifth because the U.S. Open requires a full 18-hole round as a tie-breaker).
</li><li> Robert DiPierdomenico and Dermott Brereton both suffered these during the early stages of the 1989 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">AFL</a> Grand Final. Brereton was shortly after the match began but was able to kick three goals while concussed and broken ribs.
<ul><li> DiPierdomenico broke several ribs and punctured a lung. He played out the game without even knowing how badly hurt he was and collapsed shortly after the match finished.
</li></ul></li><li> During the 2004 Olympics, Russian judoka Dmitri Nossov lost the semifinal, cutting his eyebrow muscle and seriously injuring his left arm. He still won a bronze medal <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r--bPIJYwXg">using just the remaining arm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AssociationFootball">Football</a> player Franz Beckenbauer played The "Game of the Century" against Italy in the 1970 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a> semi-finals with his arm in a sling, because Germany had already used their two-player substitutions.
<ul><li> However, some other players weren't so lucky. Pelé only played two games in 1962 after injuring his groin on a play, and in 1966 got chased by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness">violent defenders</a> of both Bulgaria (who made him miss the following game) and Portugal (who left him limping on the field as substitutions only came in 1970). And in 2014, Neymar had <em>a broken vertebra</em> after getting kneeled in the back by an adversary.
</li><li> In the 2018 Champions League final, between Liverpool and Real Madrid, Liverpool - who were already suffering from an injury crisis - got the short end of the stick twice. First, their star forward, Mohammed Salah, wound up with a shoulder ligament injury so bad that it was believed to be <em>dislocated</em>, courtesy of Madrid captain Sergio Ramos pulling what seemed to be a banned Judo move on Salah. Salah went off in tears. Until that point, halfway through the first half, Liverpool had been dominating the match. Second, early in the second half, when it was still fairly even, Ramos (again) clashed with Liverpool's German goalkeeper, Loris Karius, leaving him with what was later diagnosed as a concussion. Karius, one of the most solid keepers in the competition that season, promptly made two horrible errors that gave Real a 3-1 victory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Ramos</a> lifted the Champions League title for the third time in the row, while Karius was seen in floods of tears, begging the forgiveness of the travelling Liverpool fans (who, to be fair, gave it to him with a rousing rendition of club anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone').
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a> famously won a gold medal with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">broken freakin' neck</a>.
</li><li> Good tactics in pretty much any type of equally-matched one-on-one REAL fight to the death involving blades. As opposed to working for that tidy one-shot to the chest, neck, or head. Once your opponent is bleeding out, his form is bound to suffer. That's assuming your foe's limbs are all still attached. And this can be done without closing in enough for him to land a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutualKill">Mutual Kill</a>! Hollywood, however, disagrees. Doubly so in knife fights, since one-shot kills with knives are a bit harder to come by. Word to the wise: The loser of a knife fight dies in the street. The winner spends six months recovering and has to use a cane for the rest of their life.
</li><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> examples:
<ul><li> Hall of Famer Richard Petty once drove a then-Winston Cup race with a broken back.
</li><li> Hall of Famer Darrel Waltrip once <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">got in trouble when he drove two laps in a race with a shattered left femur</a>.
</li><li> In 2015, Kyle Busch missed several races after suffering a broken leg in the Xfinity Series opener at Daytona. NASCAR ruled that even if he won a race when he returned, he'd have to compete in a certain number of races and accumulate a certain number of points before qualifying for the Chase. Busch came back and won several races to qualify with ease despite the restrictions. He then managed to survive all the way to Homestead on points alone (no small feat) and ended up winning the Championship by 3 seconds over defending champion Kevin Harvick.
</li></ul></li><li> In Super Bowl XXXIX, Donovan McNabb completed a pass to Terrell Owens, giving him an open-field run to the endzone. However, Owens hadn't fully recovered from a leg injury from earlier in the season, so instead of scoring a touchdown like he would have on a healthy leg, a Patriot defender was able to catch up and tackle him from behind. The Eagles proceeded to fumble on the next play and went on to lose the game by 3.
</li><li> The 2012 NBA season, coming right out of a lockout, is now notorious for various injuries ultimately benching players from <em>any</em> team. More often than not, they were forced to sit out on the rest of a playoff series or missed the playoffs entirely.
<ul><li> Derrick Rose of the Chicago Bulls tore an ACL in his left knee; he was supposed to be back by <em>at least</em> February of 2013... but wound up not playing at all for the rest of that season.
</li><li> Joakim Noah, also of the Bulls, sprained his ankle about a game after Rose went down. He missed out on the final two games of the series, where Philly beat Chicago.
</li><li> Avery Bradley, of the Celtics, needed surgery on his shoulder, and he missed out on the Eastern Conference Finals with Miami.
</li><li> The Oklahoma City Thunder had Eric Maynor, a backup point guard, tear his own ACL prior to the playoffs.
</li><li> Miami Heat had Chris Bosh straining his abdominal, but he returned just in time for the end of the Eastern Conference Finals versus Boston.
</li><li> New York Knicks had rookie Iman Shumpert also tearing his own ACL during Game 1 against Miami.
</li><li> Knicks veteran Baron Davis <em>also</em> screwed his own ACL and dislocated his patella.
</li><li> Ricky Rubio, of the Minnesota Timberwolves, tore his ACL and LCL after colliding with Kobe Bryant.
</li><li> Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic harmed his back prior to the playoffs.
</li><li> Not to make a point, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">LeBron James</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Dwyane Wade</a> never got injured throughout the whole season. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Shockingly, they won the title at the end of the year.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis</a> players, the physical demands of nearly a full year of constant play all too often leads to injury and them having to either withdraw from tournaments or do their best to play on bum knees or pulled hamstrings. In extreme cases, it can sideline a player's career for years, like with Juan Martín del Potro's wrist problems severely hindering his play for at least two years. In the worst cases, it can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">derail a player's career outright</a> like with Maureen Connolly (although her injury was non-tennis-related) and Mary Pierce.
</li><li> Serena Williams has been stuck at number #2 in total Grand Slams (only one behind Margaret Court) since she beat her sister, Venus, for the Australian Open in January 2017. She was unknowingly about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PregnantBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PregnantBadass">two months pregnant</a> at the time. She had a very rough pregnancy and almost died when she had to have an emergency c-section that September. She has struggled with blood clots in her legs ever since.
</li><li> Figure skater Evgeni Plushenko was forced to withdrew only minutes before performing short program at the 2014 Winter Olympics because he aggravated his chronic spinal injury, in which the steel bolts implanted in his spine from the recent surgery <em>snapped</em> because of a botched-up jump in the warmup.
</li><li> In 2013, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndyCar">Indy Car</a> driver Dario Franchitti was in a massive accident-his third one in ten years at high speed. The crash left him with spinal and ankle fractures and a concussion. He retired from motorsport altogether when he was told that if the next crash didn't kill him, it'd severely disable him physically and/or mentally.
</li><li> In 2016 Indy car driver Josef Newgarden went literally headfirst into the wall at Texas Motor Speedway, breaking his right hand and shoulder, and there was talk about whether he would be back for the end of the season. As it turns out, he was back for the very next race at Road America, where he finished eighth in spite of having thirteen screws in his shoulder and his hand was still healing. Two weeks after that, at the G-load heavy Iowa Motor Speedway, he started on pole and utterly dominated, even while still healing from his injuries at Texas only a month before.
</li><li> Perhaps one of the most infamous of these in the NFL is the injury that Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann had during a game in 1985 when New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor accidentally broke Theismann's leg during a tackle. After realizing what happened, Taylor immediately called for help. Afterwards, Theisman was forced to retire. Since then, both offensive tackle positions<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1uaov');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1uaov" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1uaov');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The left tackle for a right-handed quarterback, and the right tackle for a left-handed quarterback.</span> were redefined to cover the quarterback's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlindSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlindSide">blind side</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2sd1r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2sd1r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2sd1r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Taylor had "blindsided" Theismann when it happened.</span> (as the movie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration">Opening Narration</a> explains) Additionally, while Theismann never blamed Taylor for the injury, Taylor still feels terrible about it to this day.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">Exactly</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">33 years later, in 2018, Redskins quarterback Alex Smith suffered a similar injury as they played the Houston Texans</a>. Fortunately for Smith, after missing the 2019 season, he would come back in the 2020 season.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2018 Indycar series season, Robert Wickens was launched into the catchfence in a two-car crash, causing him to break his arm, both ankles, and a vertebra in his back, and taking him out of the rest of the season. Later updates revealed that he is currently paraplegic, due to a bruise on his spinal cord, but he hopes to be walking again within two years, and his team has said that the car is his if he recovers sufficiently, making it an open question of whether it's this or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">Career-Ending Injury</a>.
</li><li> The 2017 Gymnastics World Championships was plagued with such injuries, so much so that people started wondering whether there was something wrong with the venue and/or the organization of the event.
<ul><li> Brazilian gymnast Rebeca Andrade, expected to possibly challenge for medals on vault and floor, tore her ACL in training.
</li><li> Also in training, reigning Men's All-Around World and Olympic champion Kohei Uchimura tore multiple ligaments in his ankle and had to withdraw from competition, ending an eight-year streak of consecutive all-around victories.
</li><li> Romanian star Larisa Iordache tore her Achilles tendon while warming up on floor exercise before the qualification round.
</li><li> American Ragan Smith qualified second into the Women's All-Around despite a fall and was largely considered the favorite to win the title. While warming up for the All-Around competition, she seriously injured her ankle and could not compete, exiting the arena on crutches.
</li><li> During the Women's Floor Exercise final, Italian gymnast and 2006 all-around champion Vanessa Ferrari tore her Achilles tendon (similar to Iordache's injury a few days earlier) and had to be carried off the podium.
</li></ul></li><li> Also in gymnastics, at the 1996 Olympics, American gymnast Kerri Strug famously sprained her ankle on her first vault attempt in the team final. The reason the incident became famous is that she nonetheless returned to the podium to make a second attempt in order to clinch the gold medal for the team. She successfully landed the vault, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">would never compete in gymnastics again</a>.
