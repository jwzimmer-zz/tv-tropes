Simple. Imply that they have a sexual interest in animals. Preferably <em>farm</em> animals, since common pets still might be a bit too squicky for some.
</p><p>This is almost always played for laughs, rather than titillation. It works partly because actual bestiality is rare enough to seem less "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">real</a>" than other acts considered perverted, similar to the unreality of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBallOfViolence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBallOfViolence">cartoon violence</a>  yet common enough that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">more plausible</a> (and seen as less gross by observers, it also doesn't have the same repulsive moral implications) than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead">necrophilia</a>. We don't normally worry about the animal, because of said unreality and our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">moral distance from animals</a>. It helps that the animals in question are not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimals">anthropomorphized</a> and are usually the more "comical" ones found in nature (goats, sheep, chickens).

</p><p>This trope also shows up in regional humour as a way to mock other regions that are considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">Acceptable Targets</a>. For example, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Britain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Britain">Britain</a>, jokes of this sort (especially regarding sheep) commonly get levied at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wales">Wales</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Scotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Scotland">Scotland</a>. Meanwhile in the Southern Hemisphere, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia">Australians</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealanders</a> like to accuse each other of excessive fondness for sheep. (As you may have guessed, sheep farming makes up a big chunk of the economy in Wales, Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand, all of which have higher populations of sheep than humans.) Latin Americans get this a lot too, especially with regards to donkeys. Sometimes also alleged toward Bedouins and other groups who have long nights alone in the desert with no company except goats and camels. The American version is usually aimed at "rednecks" from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a>, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownOnTheFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownOnTheFarm">rural Midwest</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNewEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNewEngland">northern New England</a> get some ribbing too. In Russia, the regions most commonly accused of this are the Caucasus and Central Asia. Germany's target of choice is Austria; Austria's target of choice are people from Vorarlberg, Tyrol and other rural alpine states.

<ul><li> A number of rulers and other high-ups have been slandered by more or less fabricated accusations of zoophilia, the most notable victim of such slander being Catherine the Great.
</li><li> Sending only girls, young boys, or old geezers to herd animals was the prevalent habit in Finland for the same reasons.
</li><li> While it's not folklore per se, there is a long tradition of nations and cultures accusing their neighbors of sleeping with animals. This continues into the modern day. Consider the relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewZealand">New Zealand</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Australia">Australia</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Scotland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Scotland">Scotland</a>, England and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wales">Wales</a>; in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EagleLand">the U.S.</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyoverCountry">Rural Midwest</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a> are the usual targets. For some reason, it quite often seems to be sheep.
<ul><li> Sheep have sex organs that are "essentially the same" as humans (per answers.com); they also have better control of the muscle responsible for tightening/loosening the opening of the vagina.
</li><li> One of the standard jokes: "Country X, where the men are men, and the sheep are nervous."
</li><li> Another standard joke: "In Country X, they recently discovered another use for sheep. Wool!"
</li><li> And "Why do CountryXers have sex on clifftops? The sheep push back harder."
</li><li> In most countries, it's "Hey you, get off my cloud." But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal">in Scotland</a>, it's "Hey McLeod, get off my ewe!"
</li><li> What do you call a sheep tethered to a lamppost in Cardiff? A rec centre. (See <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QI">QI</a></em> in Live-Action TV below for the reaction of Welsh comedian Rob Brydon to this joke.)
</li><li> Why do Scots wear kilts? Because the sheep started running when they heard a zipper.
</li><li> In modern Russian folklore, people from Caucasus and Central Asia are referred to as "sheep/goat/donkey fuckers". A typical joke goes something like this: Why do Georgians have two donkeys in a stable, a larger and a smaller one? The larger one is for adults to "ride"; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">smaller one is for children</a>.
</li><li> Hungarians are notorious for their elaborate cuss words and one of the nastiest goes something like "I wish you were ass-raped by a horse" (literally: "A horse's dick up your arse"). Another Hungarian expression is one that urges the other person to have oral sex with a horse. It means, roughly, "screw you". The latter is considered very vulgar, but the first can also be used jokingly, depending on social context.
</li></ul></li><li> Some people are under the delusion that people go into marine biology want to do naughty things with fish, dolphins, and cephalopods. Needless to say, actual marine biologists (and people who actually want to be actual marine biologists) are not amused. The same rule of thumb goes for the technical term for livestock farming — Animal Husbandry.
</li><li> In pre-Christian Ireland, the ceremony for the inauguration of the High King in Ulster involved the king copulating with a mare. It should be noted that the main account we have for the bestiality is Gerald of Wales, who was a member of the royal family trying to justify the Norman invasion by claiming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden">the Irish needed to be civilized by the Normans</a>. There is evidence that horses were sacrificed and eaten at Tara, but there isn't any reliable evidence that bestiality occurred.

<ul><li> Former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is an old joke:
<div class="indent"><em>A young man is walking through a small village one day and decides to stop by a bar and have a beer. He walks into a bar, and sees a grizzled old man, crying into his beer. Curious, the young man sits down and says, "Hey old timer, why the long face?"</em> <br/><em>The old man looks at him and points out the window, "See that dock out there? I built that dock with my own two hands, plank by plank, nail by nail, but do they call me McGregor the dockbuilder? No, no."</em> <br/><em>The old man continued, "And see that ship out there?

</div></li><li> There's a military joke about a young (Army/Marine) Lieutenant's first time in Iraq, with the punchline being his sergeant explains that he was supposed to ride the camel into town and pay for a hooker.
<ul><li> That's only the latest update of a joke that's at least as old as colonialism in the Middle East.
</li><li> The latest (as 2015) update is told in "A Hologram for the King" by Dave Eggers (the "Circle" guy).
</li></ul></li><li> In the British Empire's days, the British Army in Egypt/Sudan maintained a Royal Camel Corps. One day the colonel invited a young officer to his office to discuss a <em>delicate mattter</em>.
<div class="indent">Look here, Lieutenant, there's a rumour going round that you've been... you know... with your camel.
</div><div class="indent"> Yes sir, I have been intimate with my camel.
</div><div class="indent">Good God, man. (long pause). A <em>female</em> camel, I hope?
</div><div class="indent">Yes, of course, sir. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">What do you think I am? Queer?</a>
</div></li><li> Another joke describes a young shepherd who, lonely with the long hours alone in the fields with his sheep, was horrified to find himself starting to cast sideways glances at his charges. He asked an older, more experienced shepherd for advice, and was told to train a vicious dog to attack him if he started disrobing around the sheep. He did so, but the loneliness continued, until one day he heard a woman screaming off in the distance. Tracking down its source, he found a beautiful maiden who had been chased up a tree by a pack of wolves. After the shepherd and his dog chased away the wolves, the maiden asked if there were anything she could do to repay him. "Actually, there is," he replied. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Can you keep this dog distracted for about ten minutes?"</span>
<ul><li> A similar joke goes: a tired traveler is crossing a vast desert on his camel, and thinks to himself, "I haven't had sex for days... I'll make do with this camel." However, the camel won't stay still to allow him to have sex with it. Suddenly, three beautiful women appear out of nowhere. "You look lost," one says. "Can I help you?" Yes, the traveler says. "Could you please help me hold down the camel?"
</li><li> There are actually plenty of jokes that follow this basic pattern. A man wants to have sex with an animal due to being horny in an isolated place with no women, but something is preventing him to do so. A woman (or multiple women) enters the setting, usually willing to do anything the man asks of her. The punchline consists of the man asking her to take care of whatever is preventing him from having sex with the animal, rather than having sex with him herself.
</li></ul></li><li> A gentleman stops by a biker bar and notices a large jar full of twenty dollar bills sitting on a high shelf. He asks the bartender about it, and the bartender tells him that anyone who likes can put a twenty in the jar and then attempt to win the pot by completing three tasks: defeating the toughest biker in the bar in a fistfight, performing some amateur dentistry on the bartender's vicious dog which has a sore tooth, and sexually satisfying the bartender's hideously ugly nymphomaniac wife. The man drops a twenty in the jar, walks over to the biker and knocks him out with one punch. He strides confidently into the back room, where the bartender hears his dog give out the most pitiful howl he's ever heard. The man returns and asks the bartender, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">"Okay, now where's that ugly lady with the sore tooth?"</a></span>
<ul><li> There's a variation of that in Finland: A Finn, a Swede and a Norwegian were visiting Greenland, and decided to have a wager of toughness: they had to drink a keg of vodka, kill a polar bear barehanded and make love to (or rape) an Eskimo woman. The Swede and the Norwegian failed in humiliating ways, but the Finn drank down the entire keg and left off to find a polar bear. Hours later he comes back covered in claw marks and scratches and asks: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Nhow, wheresh that Eshkhimo I wash shupposhed to kill?"</span>
<ul><li> The same joke is told with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBigInTexas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBigInTexas">Texan</a> who went to Alaska, and was given the same challenge.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also a variation in Brazil: Mussum of OsTrapalhões tried to join a gang and was told that, in order to join, he had to complete three tasks: drinking a whole bottle of undiluted cachaça at once, cut off the tail of a lion caged near the bar where he and the gang were having the challenge, and kissing the ugly bartender ten times. He could do the tasks in any order he chose and started with the drinking challenge. Mussum then left the bar to search for the lion. Upon returned, he mentioned he had just finished kissing the lion and would now cut the woman's tail.
</li></ul></li><li> An American anthropologist has been studying a tribe in Africa by living with them for a year. One day, the chief called him into the chief's hut. The chief sighed. "Well, my friend, it seems that we must ask you to leave." The anthropologist was surprised by this; he thought he had gained the tribe's trust. "Why, what's the matter?" he stammered. "It seems that a woman in our tribe has given birth to a baby... a white baby," said the chief. The anthropologist began to laugh. "Oh, is that all? No, that's just a classic case of albinism. It's caused by inheriting recessive pigment genes and..." The chief didn't look convinced, so he pointed at a nearby flock of sheep. "See those sheep? All of them are white except for that one. It's like that!" The chief was silent for a moment and said, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Listen, you don't talk about the sheep, and I won't talk about the baby."</span>
</li><li> A man goes to a bawdy house and asks the proprietor what "services" he can get for five dollars. "Five dollars?!" says the proprietor. "That's all I have," says the customer. "Very well," says the proprietor, "follow me." He takes the man to a small room containing nothing but a chicken. "What am I supposed to do with <em>that</em>?" asks the man. "Hey, you came here for sex," says the proprietor, "and you get what you pay for." He leaves, and the man, disgusted but desperate, has sex with the chicken. The next week, he comes back and asks what he can get for ten dollars. "Follow me," says the proprietor. He takes the customer to a room where a number of men are watching a peep show. The customer looks through a peephole and sees a man having sex with a sheep. He joins his fellow customers in derisive laughter. Nudging the man beside him, he says, "Boy, what a pathetic sicko that guy is, huh?" "That's nothing," says the other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Last week there was a guy in there screwing a chicken."</span>
</li><li> A farmer, trying to improve his mind, takes up reading in his spare time. Every time he comes across an unfamiliar word, he jots it down so he can ask the minister, who's the most educated person in the village. One day he sees the minister walking by, waves him over, and hands him the list. "Reverend," he says, "can you tell me what these words mean?" The minister patiently defines them one by one, then blushes and hesitates as he comes to the last word. "Come on, Reverend," says the farmer. "Don't be bashful. What does 'bestiality' mean?" "Er...well," says the minister, "it refers to the forbidden and disgusting act of intimate relations with beasts, such as sheep, goats, and chickens." "Ewww," says the farmer. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">"Chickens?"</a></span>

</li><li> An American researcher comes to England to study farming. On his travels, he hears about the practice of sheep fornication. He goes around Yorkshire asking farmers "Do you have intercourse with sheep?" As you can expect, the farmers are insulted, demanding he leave and slamming the door in his face. Just as he is about to give up, one man he asks looks around and answers "yes, and I'll answer your questions so long as you can promise you won't reveal anything about me". So the researcher asks "well...how do you do it?" The farmer replies "you put the back legs in your boots and the front legs on a wall and go from there." From there, the researcher goes to Wales, where he asks the same question. The first farmer he meets boldly responds "yes!". Again, the researcher asks how, and the Welshman responds "You put the back legs in your boots and the front legs over your shoulders and go from there". The researcher says "That's interesting, because in Yorkshire a man said back legs in boots and front over a wall". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">"What?!" replies the Welshman, "No kissing?!"</a>

</li><li> A tourist is visiting Australia. While driving in the countryside, he spots a farmer with his sheep. The tourist asks, "Are you shearing that sheep?" The farmer replies, "No, get your own. I'm not sharing her with anyone!" This is a rare example of a sheep joke where the country names can't simply be swapped, because it only works with "sharing" said in an Australian accent.
<ul><li> "Sharing" and "shearing" sound different in Australia, however they 'do' sound the same in ... New Zealand.

"But what about the sheep?" asks the second. "<em>Fuck</em> the sheep!" shouts the first. The second responds: "You think we have the time?"
</li><li> A man arrives in a Gold Rush boom town, and asks in the saloon what they do for entertainment, since there are no women in the town. He's told there's a flock of sheep, and everyone has sex with them. The new arrival is horrified by this, but as the days go on he gets more and more desperate. Finally he decides that if he's going to do it, he's going to do it right, so he chooses a sheep, dresses it up, and takes it to the saloon for a drink. When he arrives, everything goes silent, and all the patrons stare at him in shock. Embarrassed he stammers "I was told everyone here did it!" "Yeah," comes the reply, "but we don't pick up the sheriff's girl!"

</li><li> A professor at the University of Tennessee was giving a lecture on the supernatural. To get a feel for his audience, he asks, "How many people here believe in ghosts?" About 90 students raise their hands. "Well, that's a good start. Out of those of you who believe in ghosts, do any of you think you've seen a ghost?" About 40 students raise their hands. "That's really good. I'm really glad you take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?" About 15 students raise their hands. "Has anyone here ever touched a ghost?" 3 students raise their hands. "That's fantastic. Now let me ask you one question further... Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?" Way in the back, Bubba raises his hand. The professor takes off his glasses, and says, "Son, all the years I've been giving this lecture no one has ever claimed to have made love to a ghost. You've got to come up here and tell us about your experience." The big South Carolina redneck student replied with a nod and a grin, and began to make his way up to the podium. When he reached the front of the room, the professor asks, "So, Bubba, tell us what it's like to have sex with a ghost?" Bubba replied, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">"Shiiiiit! From way back thar I thought you said, goats."</a>

A large animal, such as a horse or a cow, you're not going to hurt it, it'd probably never even notice. But a small animal, like a chicken or a small dog, you're a sick fuck who gets off on hurting things smaller than yourself because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenyWeenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenyWeenie">you never made a woman go "ow"</a>.
</li><li> An elderly woman had a fantasy about marrying a man who'd never been with a woman before. She applied to a rather discreet matchmaking service which gave her the name of an Australian gentleman. They got in touch, hit it off and soon were married. On their wedding night, she walked into the bedroom only to discover that all of the furniture had been moved to the side of the room. When she asked why her new husband replied "Well, I've never done it with a woman before, but if it's anything like kangaroos then we're gonna need all the space we can get."
</li><li> One day a hunter took his trusty Winchester to the mountains to hunt for bear. He hid behind a rock that overlooked a beautiful valley and waited. Soon a bear appeared by the stream which ran through the valley. The hunter aimed and fired. When the smoke cleared he couldn't see the bear. Then there was a tap, tap, tap on his shoulder. The man turned around and there was the bear, standing 7 feet high, towering over him. The bear said, "You tried to shoot me, didn't you?" To which the hunter replied, "Yes, I'm afraid I did." "Well," said the bear, "in that case you will have to give me a blow job." Having no choice in the matter, the hunter did as he was told. That night, the hunter was really angry and vowed to get revenge. So the next day, he went to the same spot, only this time he brought a huge elephant gun. Once again, the bear appeared and the hunter fired. After the smoke cleared, the hunter couldn't see a carcass. Tap, tap, tap. "You tried to shoot me, didn't you?" "Why, yes, I'm afraid I did." "Well, take your pants down and bend over. I'm going to have to screw you up the ass." Having no choice, the hunter did what he was told. That night, the hunter was really, really angry and resolved that he would get the bear, no matter what. This time he brought an M60. He went to the same spot and waited until the bear appeared by the stream. He fired off fifty rounds. When the smoke cleared, he couldn't see the bear. Tap, tap, tap. "You tried to shoot me, didn't you?" The Hunter gulped. "Yes, I'm afraid I did." The bear thought for a moment then said, "You don't come here for the hunting, do you?"

<div class="indent"><strong>Farmer 1:</strong> Why are you so sad? <br/><strong>Farmer 2:</strong> My tractor broke down and I can't afford a new one. Why are <em>you</em> so sad? <br/><strong>Farmer 1:</strong> Last week I went to milk my cow, and she kicked the pail over, so I had to tie her leg to a post. Then I put the pail back in its place, but the cow kicked the pail with her other leg. I couldn't find another rope, so I used my belt to tie that leg to a post, and my pants fell down. Then my wife came in, and... well, I'll make you a deal. If you can convince her I was trying to milk the cow, then you can have one of my tractors for free.
</div></li><li> Two dogs in the antechamber of the vet's office are discussing what circumstances brought them each there. The first dog, a pit bull, says, "It's not my fault I bit that kid. He kept pulling my tail, even when I growled at him repeatedly to stop. The little brat had it coming, and now I'm gonna get put to sleep! It's not fair!" The second dog, a large Doberman, says, "Well, what happened to me was this: I have a really, really cute mistress, and every morning for the past three years since she rescued me from the pound, I've had to watch as she got out of the shower, dried off and rubbed her body with lotion, then dressed. Finally, this morning, I couldn't take anymore. So when she bent over, I jumped on her and gave it to her hard. Man, it was great!" The first dog then says, "So I guess you're being put to sleep too, huh?" To which the Doberman replies, "Naaah, I'm just getting my nails trimmed!"
</li><li> A man walks into a bar and plumps down on a stool, with an extremely sorrowful look on his face. When the bartender asks what's wrong, the man replies: "Just this afternoon, I came home early from work and caught my wife in bed with my best friend." The bartender says, "Wow, that's rough, fella. What did you do?" The man replies, "I looked him right in the eye and said 'Bad dog'!"

"So, what was your finest experience?" "Well, a sheep got lost in the outback. We sent a big posse out to find it. When we found it, we all celebrated by shagging it." The reporter winces. Not even The Sun would print that. "Uhm...eh...and second best?" "Well, the neighbor's fourteen year old daughter got lost in the outback. We sent a big posse out to find her. When we found her..."

"Silly boy, <em>you're</em> not supposed to lick it off! What site did you think we met on?"

The main character shoots the man in the head (nonlethal, given the futuristic setting, but quite an unpleasant experience). This is treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment.

<ul><li> He and his Companion are in love with each other, but he only ever mounts her in the usual equine sense. The heralds probably would have had something to say, otherwise... Luckily Companions are the divinely reincarnated souls of dead (human) Heralds, which helps a little.
<ul><li> To be even more precise, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he and his Companion are Life Bonded, which means they are fated to be paired together and it is something they has NO control over.

It does mean that he will never have a normal romantic relationship with anyone else. Lackey started the Life Bond concept as the ultimate romantic ideal, but gradually moved it back as her work progressed to indicate that it could have problems.

Kitai, one of the Marat who's bonded with Tavi, an Aleran, makes a joke similarly when she's explaining the bond—Tavi asks if his bond with her is like her father, Doroga's, bond with a gargant, named Walker, and she says when she last checked, Doroga wasn't mating with Walker... because Walker wouldn't stand for it.

Turned out it was actually his hot stepmother he was attracted to. And he didn't want to admit that. So he pretended he was into cows. Okay.
<ul><li> Also, one time, House was talking with Thirteen and another female doctor in his office, while on his computer. The female doctor looks at the computer screen (which cannot be seen) and gets a noticeably squicked out expression. House asks her, "do you have a problem with the naked female form?" Thirteen then says "I just don't think she's used to seeing it spooning with the naked <em>dolphin</em> form." This being House, it was most likely a ploy to get them to go away faster. Probably.

Howard warns Vince in one episode, not to get too close to any of the animals in the zoo bringing up the example of a (literal) fox in a nearby cage. which apparently was a "Mistake" according to Howard. Apparently in the Mighty Boosh world bestiality is a scandal more like a professor sleeping with a graduate student than how it's viewed in real life...
<ul><li> This is probably because animals in the Boosh-verse are sapient. Most of them can talk, and are of comparable intelligence to the human characters.

</li><li> And let's not forget Stephen's reaction to the pictures illustrating the question "How can a horse catch an eel?"; "That's a rather attractive horse." (Both Rich Hall and Sean Locke immediately retort that they'd rather have the eel.) Stephen's affections for the horse <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4KOw38XVSw">lasted throughout the episode.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<ul><li> In the law books of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em>, especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfExodus">Book of Exodus</a>, anyone (male or female) who has sex with an animal is to be executed. The animal is also considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">Defiled Forever</a>, and must be slaughtered. The Old Testament forbids shepherds from going out alone (making them leave in pairs) specifically to prevent this "abomination," and Exodus has a bit about those who lie down with beasts. In the apocrypha of the Torah based on the story of Noah, meanwhile, bestiality was apparently so commonplace in antediluvian Earth that Noah's attempt to send out a raven to check whether the flood was over got derailed when the raven accused him of trying to steal its mate in its absence (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumour">before flying off and having sex with an eagle</a>).

This goes back to Exodus 22:19, which states "Whoever lies [has sex] with an animal shall surely be put to death." Deuteronomy and Leviticus repeated this rule.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>, Beastiality is also a serious sin. There is a Hadith by Ibn Abbaas in which the Prophet Muhammad tells his followers "If you find that someone has had intercourse with an animal, kill him and kill the animal too."

</li><li> Subverted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ChineseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ChineseMythology">Chinese Mythology</a> and popular folklore, where interspecies pairings are common and considered BENEFICIAL in terms of the resulting offspring, who is often physically perfect/beautiful, highly intelligent, a prodigy, or inherited magical abilities from parents. Many protagonists are actually ANIMAL SPIRITS and the stories revolve around their interspecies romance with mostly humans.
<ul><li> For example, Madam White Snake is the title and main character of her story, and the audience is meant to be sympathetic to her when she is betrayed by her human husband.
</li><li> An entire origin myth of several ethnic groups living in the central-eastern region of China revolves around their dog ancestor Pan Hu, the Dog King. When a king requested help in defeating his rival, his pet dog kills and retrieves the head of said rival. The reward was his daughter's hand, and the king had no choice but to fulfill that promise. After taking her into the mountains, Pan Hu meditates to attain human form (in several stories, the princess interrupts the process and he is left with a dog's head). They produce many children between them, who become the ancestors of various tribes that live in that mountain and hold Pan Hu as their common forebear. These ethnic groups have travelled and brought their culture overseas to places like Canada, and hold many proud festivals celebrating and proclaiming their connection with Pan Hu the Dog King.
</li><li> Though whether this is a full subversion is up for debate, as these animal spirits are noted to have attained sapience and human form via meditation, effectively surpassing their original 'base beast' form and placing them spiritually and intellectually on par with normal humans. However, the stories always remind people that they are in fact, <strong>still animals</strong>, and that their 'humanity' is still in some ways, a mimicry. They are however, not stigmatized for what they are or for pursuing relationships with humans, but are respected for their ability to reach this stage in enlightenment and the magical powers they attained while doing so.
</li></ul></li><li> Also subverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/JapaneseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/JapaneseMythology">Japanese Mythology</a> and popular folklore (as well as popular culture, as Japanese porn is notorious for eroticizing women having sex with animals, especially those with tentacles, e.g. the infamous classic painting, The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife, where a woman has sex with an octopus) , as the national traditional religion Shinto is similarly animist, where literally <em>everything</em> has a spirit, which becomes sentient with age. This is best seen in the case of stories involving the <em>Kitsune</em> who are foxes who magically shapeshift between human and animal forms, where the females are almost always idealized as the perfect wives (though the love stories usually have bittersweet tragic ends, as is customary in Japanese traditional romances). In fact, the word <em>Kit-su-ne</em> literally means <em>Come sleep with me</em>.
<ul><li> However, its also played straight on occasion. Perhaps one of the most infamous examples is "The Eight Canine Heroes Of House Satomi", a series of paintings illustrating a Japanese folk tale of a dog who marries his owner's daughter after fulfilling a task, who proceeds to birth him eight prodigious sons... and kill herself in shame because of this. Said paintings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">depict said daughter being graphically ravaged by the dog</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KoreanMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KoreanMythology">Korean Mythology</a> and popular folklore, where the Korean version of the Kitsune, the female-only Gumiho is villified as almost always a maliciously man-eating monster.
</li><li> Hinduistic Mythology: Consider for example the classic Indian story "The Adventures of the Ten Princes" which contains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList">Long List</a> of the carnal misbehaviors of gods and sages, including the sun god making out with a mare, the wind god with a monkey and sage Atri with a gazelle (and we're not talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Zootopia">Gazelle</a>). See also the Other Wiki on this trope for "The Nayika as the lovers of all creatures" (all meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnatomicallyImpossibleSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnatomicallyImpossibleSex">''all''</a>), which is somewhat justified as she here symbolizes a cosmic principle of love and fertility.

</li><li> For the Garou in the cWoD, at least occasional bestiality is practically a part of life; they can't breed true with each other (any offspring from such unions is usually deformed or otherwise 'defective' in some way as well as generally sterile) and need to mate with humans or wolves to have a shot at having actually viable Garou offspring, and there's at least anecdotal evidence that favoring one branch of the 'family' too much over the other actually is detrimental to a bloodline in the long run. (Replacing "wolves" with the relevant animal type, the same holds true for the other kinds of weres in the game as well.)
<ul><li> Of course, being shapeshifters, it's rather debateable whether screwing a wolf when you yourself are for all intents a wolf as well (albeit with human intelligence) should be considered bestiality.

She is first required to strip, may drink an aphrodisiac, then enter a cage to "offer herself" to four demon dogs. However, if she declines to drink the aphrodisiac and doesn't say anything to offend the high priest, she'll instead be forced to watch another girl get sexually assaulted by the dogs. However, there's the option to stop it by attacking and killing the demon dogs whether the princess herself or the other girl has to go into the cage.

<ul><li> In an actual canon example; the night elves' goddess, Elune, who by all official accounts looks like a big glowing night elf woman, had an affair with the demigod Malorne, whose only known form was that of a giant (read, two hundred feet tall) stag. This resulted in the birth of Cenarius, who looked like a centaur with a night elf upper body and a stag lower body. Being that these are deities, this is justified; just look at the mythology examples above.

</li><li> In "Fleabiscuit", Roger, in a dog costume, becomes a racing hound under Hayley's tutelage. It's explained that he was originally cast as Eddie from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em>, but discovered he had a talent for running fast to escape the advances of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer">Kelsey Grammer</a>.

In a flashback in Season 4, Malory is shown taking Duchess on a romantic carriage ride through Central Park as a birthday present.
<ul><li> When asked how she became so great at sex, Pam ascribes it to growing up on a dairy farm.
</li><li> Dr. Krieger seems to have a similar relationship as Malory to Piggly 3.

<div class="indent"><strong>Quagmire:</strong> <em>[stirs awake]</em> Hmmm, honey, that feels really good. Hey, hey, HEY! WHAT THE HELL?! You're not the same giraffe from last night! Get out of here!

</div></li><li> Back when Peter first became a fisherman, him and the guys play a game of "I Never", in which you had to take a shot if you ever did anything that any of the others said they never did. Quagmire ends up getting wasted more and more with each shot. One of them involved giving a monkey a reach-around.
</li><li> From the same episode, Peter develops a rivalry with a fellow fisherman. At one point, he switches out the sign at Peter's fish stall with one that says "I Had Sex With All These Fish", catching the interest of a passing man.
<div class="indent"><strong>Man:</strong> Wow. So how do you do it? <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> Well, I throw the old worm out there, they usually go for that, and after struggling a bit they lie back and accept it. <br/><strong>Man:</strong> <em>[gives Peter a card with his phone number]</em> We should get together later. <br/><strong>Peter:</strong> Uh, okay?
</div></li><li> Quagmire also apparently got it on with a turtle once, during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gag</a> that has Quagmire sticking his head out of a turtle shell to see if there was something going on.

<ul><li> Under normal circumstances, Brian's many, many human girlfriends would definitely count, but aside from a brief mention by Peter they aren't even seen as unusual in the slightest... until Brian traveled to an alternate universe where humans' and dogs' roles were reversed. <em>Then</em> his desire for human women became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a>. Stewie has also made advances on Brian from time to time, but the show doesn't comment on this either.

</li><li> Several episodes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> reference or portray zoophilia for comic effect. In the movie, one of the phrases the doctor uses to test Cartman's new V-Chip is "horsefucker" and the image used is a man having sex with a horse. In "Douche and Turd," PETA members are portrayed as being married to various animals. One member has even <em>had a child</em> with an ostrich.
