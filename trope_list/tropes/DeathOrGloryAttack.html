<ul><li> There's an infamous cheating move in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong">Mahjong</a> known as "tsubame gaeshi" in which the player exchanges their entire hand with the tiles in the wall in front of them. (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0JBvkJu1_U">Video demonstration by pro player Kojima Takeo here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) It's extremely obvious if anyone is even looking at your tiles while you do it, it's easy to just drop your entire hand everywhere, and generally there are about a bajillion ways it can fail and make it blatantly obvious that you were trying to cheat. But done right, you can give yourself basically any hand you want. This should go without saying, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontTryThisAtHome">Don't Try This at Home</a> unless you want the crap beaten out of you by three extremely angry opponents.
<ul><li> Declaring an Open Riichi (declaring you need only one tile left to win, and then revealing your almost-winning hand while still waiting for said tile) in the Japanese ruleset. Most Mahjong parlours don't allow it, but for those who do, it's a two-han <em>yaku</em> (a multiplier for your score) that stacks with the contents of your hand, but also reveals what hand you're going for to all your opponents. An open riichi can basically only be won by self-draw, since anyone with a functioning pair of eyes can avoid dealing into it (unless they're also in riichi), and has the normal caveat that you can't replace any of the tiles in your hand and forcing you to discard all your draws that won't win you the hand.
</li></ul></li><li> In chess, there is what is called a speculative sacrifice  one player gives up a large amount of material (usually at least a bishop/knight, but sometimes a rook, queen, or even more) based on pure instinct  instead of calculating the final result (which in many cases would be impossible), the player hopes that factors like piece activity, weaknesses in their opponent's position, a strong attack, etc. will end up justifying the material lost. When it works a game is often hailed as a brilliancy, but if it fails, the player who offered the sacrifice is obviously at a huge disadvantage.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Card Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The Moon Shot (or Shooting The Moon) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Hearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Hearts">Hearts</a>: Winning all points (all hearts and the Queen of Spades) (in a game where the usual purpose is winning as few as possible, to keep your score low). Succeed, and every other player gains 26 points. Fail, and you will gain more points the closer you came to completing the Shot, up to a maximum of 25 if you just barely fail, and if someone figures out what is going on, they'll slip a heart into a trick that you can't win, so it's safest when you take all tricks.
</li><li> Most combo decks in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectibleCardGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollectibleCardGame">Collectible Card Games</a> (especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>) fall here: Just enough defenses to hold off the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> and set up the combo. When it does go off, you win... <em>unless</em> your opponent has the right countermeasures for it...
<ul><li> The vast majority of combo decks follow the pattern of trying to "go off" and win in one decisive turn as soon as they collect all the pieces, which is exactly the right time to yank the carpet under their feet. This leads to waiting for the opponent to be unable to react, or preferring the lockdown style of combo in which you don't expose yourself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradualGrinder">the opponent slowly gets hurt without being able to do anything dangerous</a>.
</li><li> Red and Black like to do this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>:
<ul><li> Red can load their deck with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">cheap creatures</a> and damage spells and hope to win in the first 5 or so turns. If the game goes on for too long, they don't have any 'big' spells to compete with and will probably lose.
</li><li> The ultimate manifestation of this for red might be <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=12970">Final Fortune<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which allows the caster to take another turn after the current one, but at the end of that turn, they will automatically lose the game (so they have to win it before getting that far).
</li><li> Black has lots of spells that cost life (or other non-easily-renewable resources) to play or use, but tend to be much better due to the extra cost. Too many of those spells, and you become just as likely to kill yourself as your opponent.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NetRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NetRunner">Net Runner</a></em> has a good number of cards that do this sort of thing, but the most "traditional" is probably Lucidrine Booster Drug. It's a card that lets the Runner make a run with a significant amount of extra money, but after the run is over, they lose any of the bits that they didn't spend, and take unpreventable brain damage.
</li><li> Similar to Shooting The Moon in Hearts, Spades have Blinds, where you can bid a set amount without looking at your cards to gauge potential scoring. (Blind 7 and Blind Nil being the most common variants.) Crosses with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a>, since most rule sets only allow Blinds if you have a negative score and/or are down by at least 100 points. Pulling it off gives you double points (a Blind 7 gives you 140 points). Failing <strong>loses you</strong> double points. A Blind Nil (betting you win zero tricks) is +/-200 points, but is particularly hard to pull off, especially since there is one unbeatable card (Ace of Spades, Deuce of Spades or Big Joker, depending on what rules variant you're using) and its presence in your hand will instantly sink your attempt.
</li><li> Declaring "all-in" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Poker">poker</a> is often this, depending on the situation. Most players have been in a situation where the difference between getting knocked out of the game or becoming the chip leader by a wide margin was decided by the fall of a single card, or the call-or-fold decision of a single opponent, after declaring all-in.
</li><li> WWE Raw Deal's original version of the Undertaker has a card that lets you go through your deck and choose the perfect hand... and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">removes the entire rest of your deck from the game</a>. In a game where the primary win condition is running your opponent out of cards. Better hope that, whatever you're planning, you manage to pull it off.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> Trading Card Game</em>, throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Generation III</a>, had the Pokémon-star mechanic, Pokémon whose name had a star after it. A common characteristic of these cards is one attack that normally does pitiful damage, but gains a <em>massive</em> jump in damage and/or secondary effects if the opponent is close to winning the game. Under the right conditions, this attack can cause a runaway <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic">comeback</a> and win the game for you. Under all other conditions, this attack remains ineffective and you lose.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, several strategies require you to commit all resources you have to eliminate your opponent in a single turn. If your opponent somehow survives the onslaught, or is able to counter it somehow, you are left defenseless against them.
<ul><li> In addition, several cards use this trope, putting you at a severe disadvantage if the move is countered. The card <em>Relay Soul</em> allows you to summon a monster from your hand, and while it is out on the field, you take no damage. However, the second it is no longer face-up, you immediately lose the duel.
</li><li> <em>Power Bond</em> is also used for this trope, along with <em>Limiter Removal</em>. "Power Bond" lets you fusion summon a Machine Fusion Monster and doubles its Attack points, at the cost of taking damage equal to the monster's original attack points at the turn's end. "Limiter Removal" also doubles the attack points of any Machine-Type monster the user has in play when the card resolves, but destroys the affected monsters at the turn's end. The most common monsters used with this pair of cards are "Cyber End Dragon" and "Ultimate Ancient Gear Golem", which go up to <em>16,000</em> and <em>17,600</em> Attack Points respectively and inflict piercing battle damage.
</li><li> Using the instant-win effect of Exodia is something a player has to commit to, as it eats four cards in your hand until the fifth is drawn, leaving you with little hand space for other strategies. To make matters worse, if you didn't come in with a backup strat to make up for losing any of the pieces from your hand, or you spent the entire game with three-four of the pieces in your hand only to check your deck after winning/losing to realize the last one is at the bottom of your deck and you didn't search it, you just lost your entire strategy, as all five pieces <em>must</em> be in your hand for this to work.
</li><li> Backs to the Wall is an all-or-nothing strategy to take out your opponent when you're at a serious disadvantage. You're dropped to 100 LP, but can summon as many Six Samurai monsters from your graveyard as possible. You either ruin your opponent and try to regain some LP to stay up and finish the battle, or your opponent casually kills you with Sparks during their next turn after shutting your final gambit down and defeating you anyways. You're left to consider if it was safer to wait for the next draw, or risk it all. This, of course, becomes less and less questionable the closer you get to 100 LP.
</li><li> The Winged Dragon of Ra is a problem to use for this reason. While Sphere Mode makes this beast far more usable, its default effect requires the player to drop their LP to 100 and give Ra the difference in ATK. This can give Ra an original ATK of 7900 or more (with LP increases), making Ra potentially the strongest monster summoned all game. With good spell and trap coverage, it won't be long before your opponent goes down. Ra may be a powerhouse this way, with ATK likely outclassing anything your opponent has to throw at you, but it's easily checked if you're not careful. Even the use of Sparks, let alone any spell/trap that deals LP damage to you, will get you defeated near instantly. To make matters worse, The Wicked Avatar, which is admittedly a rare card to end up fighting, can ruin your day, as its ATK and DEF will always be 100 points higher than the highest ATK monster on the field, meaning a player forced into attacking it will quickly realize their mistake. Any savvy player who manages to get Avatar on the field after Ra appears will find themselves a victor in seconds (after all, Avatar stops any spell and trap cards for 2 turns after summoning). The Wicked Dreadroot can do this as well. If a player does not get themselves over 8000 LP before using Ra, Dreadroot will immediately cut it in half, placing Ra at 3950 at best. Sure, the player who played Ra will survive its attack, but with 50 LP and humiliation at losing their best monster.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SentinelsOfTheMultiverse">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a></em>, Setting Sun Ra has a majorly over-the-top power that damages all enemies, but it not only also damages him, it erodes his field and removes chunks of his deck from the game entirely as well. When he's incapacitated, he has abilities that destroy his card entirely in exchange for major board impact or enough damage to seriously threaten a weakened villain. Thematically, this represents Ra during his doomed assault on OblivAeon, which got him obliterated, but dealt the first damage anyone had managed to get through the big guy's shield.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> is the Death or Glory move from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, a called maneuver in which a unit stands in the path of a charging enemy vehicle to squeeze a good shot off. Success means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-shotting</a> a large enemy tank. Failure means you go squish.
<ul><li> This is referenced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAbnett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanAbnett">Dan Abnett</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em> novel <em>Necropolis</em>, where the civilian militia resorted to sending men with demo charges to destroy the advancing Chaos tanks. When a Guardsman found out about this tactic, it resulted in the following conversation:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Guardsman:</strong> How many tanks have you destroyed? <br/><strong>Militia:</strong> Twenty-four, I think. <br/><strong>Guardsman:</strong> How many men did you lose? <br/><strong>Militia:</strong> <em>(shrugs)</em> Twenty-four, of course.
</div></li><li> In 5th edition, the "Barrels of Monkeys" list involves you taking Inquisitor Coteaz and as many Jokaero as you can fit into a list (Coteaz's special ability removing the previous limits on how many you could take). This was a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeArmy">Lethal Joke Army</a> due to the fact that if you managed to get first turn, it can completely obliterate your opponent's army in one turn due to Jokaero being armed with a slew of super-powerful weapons. If you didn't get the first turn or roll absolutely abysmally? you'll likely be wiped off the board on <em>their</em> first turn. Jokaero are about as durable as tissue paper and Coteaz isn't all that threatening by himself.
</li></ul></li><li> All-Out Attacks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> are variously more accurate or more powerful than normal attacks but they leave you unable to defend yourself immediately afterward.
<ul><li> Acting as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">Frontline General</a> in Mass Combat. While the bonuses gained by leading from the front in an engagement are substancial... So are the risks involved.
</li></ul></li><li> A large number of feats and combat styles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, at least in the third edition, are centered around lowering your stats for extra damage. The classic one would be Reckless Offensive, a feat that allows you to trade armor class for extra accuracy on your strikes  another one would be Robilar's Gambit, a feat that lets you counter-attack anyone who melee attacks you that round in return for a greatly reduced armor class. The most popular option, however, is Shocktrooper's Heedless Charge, which allows you to shift your power attack penalty to hit to your armor class, causing it to plummet to nothing. Another common one is Headlong Charge, which causes you to take an attack of opportunity when you attack as part of a charge.
<ul><li> The Bravura Warlord in fourth edition has a lot of moves like this, some of which also encourage your buddies to make reckless attacks as well.
</li><li> The basic Charge counts, as well. You can move twice your speed and attack in the same turn (normally moving twice your speed costs you an action you'd use to attack with), but the movement must be in a straight line and you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until the start of your next turn. It'll quickly get you into melee range of the enemy, all right... but if the party isn't there to support you, that turn is likely your last.
</li><li> In 5th Edition, Barbarians gain an ability called Reckless Attack at 2nd level that lets them choose each round to gain Advantage on all attacks they make for one round in exchange for giving all enemies who attack them Advantage as well. However, part of the disadvantage of this ability can be mitigated while using their Rage ability, which gives them resistance to physical damage (but using Reckless Attack while fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStab">one or more rogues</a> is not a great idea).
</li></ul></li><li> D&amp;D 3.5's spiritual successor <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em> has a feat literally titled "Death or Glory." You make an attack with some serious bonuses to hit and damage against a large enemy creature. Better hope it kills them, though (or you have a good chunk of HP left), because the target gets a chance to immediately attack you <em>with the same bonuses</em>.
</li><li> Almost every advanced combat maneuver in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a></em> Storyteller System requires the user to forgo their defense, leaving them with only their armor. Of course, since one of these combat maneuvers allows you to punch one opponent four times in a single round, defending yourself might not be too much of an issue.

The problem? If your attack failed to hit, at the end of the duration of this Charm, <strong>you</strong> die.

<ul><li> Also, it's a setting where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a>, both dodge and parry, is <em>very</em> cheap. It's a very good representative of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>.

While they are doing this, they will start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">counting from one to nine</a>, so any enemy familiar with this cult will know what's coming.

The tactic is less risky in fleet engagements where ships can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wingman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wingman">cover for each other</a>.
</li><li> Fairly common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>  especially the "Classic" era. Very few 'Mechs can fire all their weapons at once without raising their heat level to a point where the 'Mech is very likely to shut down. This is known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike">Alpha Strike</a> and taken at the right time, it can be the chance that wins the battle... or loses it.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Death from Above</a> maneuver is considered this. Jumping onto an enemy 'Mech to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a> them can be devastating... if it succeeds. Chances are good that a successful DFA will heavily damage the target or destroy them outright courtesy of a smashed cockpit. Chances are also good that the 'Mech attempting the maneuver will fall and damage itself as well, leaving it at the mercy of gravity, the intended victim, and any of the intended victim's friends. What's more  and what can readily make this attack another example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>  is that the 'Mech trying to perform it can't use its weapons that turn, but <em>can</em> be shot at just fine by any and all enemy units in range while it's still technically in mid-air and has no cover.

Once it fully retracts, it becomes a wide rubber flat tip meant to give one last Desperation Attack before spinning out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Trogdor</a> has one in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Trogdor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Trogdor">the board game that bears his name.</a> Should Trogdor take damage when he has no health left, he goes into a frenzy known as "Trogdor's Fiery Rage". Trogdor gets five movement cards in a row, burninating down each tile he walks on, and everything and everyone on it (except the archers). While in his Fiery Rage, Trogdor can use wrap-around movement, which is normally used by everyone but Trogdor. If Trogdor fails to burn down every last tile, peasant, and thatch-roofed cottage in the countryside by the time his rage runs out, the game is lost.

<ul><li> Parrying with your shield in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> is more of a movement than an attack, but nevertheless applies. If you parry correctly, you knock your enemy's weapon aside and open them up to a massively powerful counter-attack. If you don't parry correctly, you've just given up your ability to dodge or block the attack, and you're about to be pounded into the ground.

He creates an enormous fiery explosion that can easily destroy even a very tough and well-armored player if they're caught in it. However, this attack drains all of the fire out of him, leaving him helpless afterward. Survive the explosion, and the Old Demon King is more or less guaranteed to die.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantEnemyCrab">Giant Enemy Crabs</a> sometimes rear up to slam their entire body down.

However, if you miss the window, then you get a big ol' crab slamming down right on your head and crushing you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>: The combat system is designed around the above Dark Souls games, but distinctly puts far less emphasis on defense, giving you only one (extremely worthless) shield. As such, the entire game incentivizes players to throw themselves into combat and deal large damage in strings of combos while mixing dodges and attacks together, or outright eat a flurry of blows or huge crushing hits when you fail to read your target properly.
<ul><li> A major part of the game, Riposte attacks and the Rallying system are all about this. Instead of backstabbing like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>, you have to shoot the enemy at just the right moment to get an opening for a powerful Visceral Attack. It ends with either the enemy or you dead.
</li><li> The Rallying system takes it a step further by allowing you to regain back health by immediately closing in and hitting enemies with wild abandon before the recoverable health becomes a lasting injury, at the risk of getting counter-attacked during the combo and losing even more health.

If Vegeta wins the mini-game, he survives with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">one hit point</a>, while his opponent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">loses all their life instantly</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield">Battlefield 2</a></em>'s sniper kit could get into some interesting showdowns with jeeps. Any time a jeep driver sees infantry out in the open, there's a decent chance he'll try to run them over. If the sniper is feeling bold, he can stop, take aim, and kill the driver with a single flawlessly aimed headshot, bringing the jeep to a stop. If he misses, it is incredibly unlikely he'll have time to get clear before being run down, much less take another shot.
<ul><li> Sometimes if the sniper kills the driver too close to himself, the jeep does not have enough time to come to a full stop and it smashes into the sniper anyways. Due to a somewhat buggy kill scoring system, the driver may or may not get credit for the kill.
</li><li> Similarly: The C4 packs. If you manage to stick a few of them to a vehicle and detonate, you have a guaranteed kill. Of course, this requires you to be in close range of a tank (which will kill you pretty much as soon as one of the occupants notices you) or a jeep (where either machine gunners or getting run over will kill you). Against infantry, they are also like mines or grenades you can control, but holding the detonator leaves you completely defenseless if they see you. Not to mention the high chance of getting caught in the explosion yourself.

To get it, you must assassinate something while falling from a height that would have killed you. If you succeed, you get the achievement and survive (the assassination breaks your fall). If you fail, your target gets to see your body slam into the ground next to them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/S4League" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/S4League">S4 League</a></em>'s melee weapons are pretty well made of this trope. The storm bat, plasma sword, and counter sword are all extremely powerful and stylish ways to put an end to your enemy  but after completing a combo, they leave the wielder horribly exposed for about two seconds, an eternity in a fast-paced game. If you miss or if your target has backup, you probably will not survive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PuzzleQuest">Puzzle Quest</a>: Galactrix</em>, the Bola Mine attack can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-shot</a> lesser opponents and severely damage more powerful ones. But since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpredictableResults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpredictableResults">the placement of mines is random</a>, it can also do minimal damage AND leave your opponent with a board full of mines to hit you with. (Especially if your opponent also has Bola Mine.) The Deathbringer spell in <em>Challenge of the Warlords</em> works the same way.
</li><li> Instant Kill Moves in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuiltyGear">Guilty Gear</a></em> series. Connect? It's an instant KO. Miss? Your Tension Gauge is gone for the rest of the round.
<ul><li> In the first game, when the opportunity to input the IK arises, the opponent can race to input a "counter" command or even the same IK motion, possibly eliminating the instigator instead. In the same game, IKs win the <em>whole match</em> instead of just one round.
</li></ul></li><li> Several characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em> have these. Most are telegraphed attacks with ridiculously long windups:
<ul><li> Possibly the most interesting is Yoshimitsu's reverse hara-kiri: He takes a step forward, turns to face the opposite direction, and stabs himself in the stomach. It deals massive damage to him and, if it connects, even more to his opponent.
</li><li> The Devil/Angel beam. It will erase half your opponent's lifebar, but has such a long wind-up that most human players and higher-level CPU players can position themselves for a severe counterattack.
</li><li> Paul's straight punch comes to mind. Amusingly though, the slight lean backwards as he winds up made it possible to use this as a dodge/counter against someone who was trying to land a ridiculously powerful attack on you, which generally resulted in a confused and/or enraged opponent pausing for a half-second before being blasted across the screen.
</li><li> Miguel has a hugely telegraphed move where he casually walks up to his opponent and laughs before winding up a punch and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">laying them out in a single hit</a>.
</li><li> Every character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken7">Tekken 7</a></em> can use a "Rage Art", which is contingent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic">being nearly defeated</a> (which triggers Rage Mode). Once in Rage Mode, you have one chance to use your Rage Art (or Rage Drive, which typically deals less damage on its own but is more combo-oriented). Regardless if it connects, is blocked, or whiffs, that's the only chance you get to use it for the rest of the round.
</li></ul></li><li> Storm's "Hailstorm" super from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenChildrenOfTheAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XMenChildrenOfTheAtom">X-Men: Children of the Atom</a></em> works much the same way as the Devil/Angel Beam.
</li><li> Parries and Just Defense, respectively from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Garou: Mark of the Wolves</a></em>, require precise timing but allow you to counter almost instantly, gain meter and receive no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a>. The latter also offers a health bonus. Successfully Just Defending a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a> gives you a whole lot more health.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterXTekken">Street Fighter X Tekken</a></em> had "Pandora Mode" Activating the mode gave you 15% more power to your attacks (not counting Gem boosts) and infinite EX Moves and Special Arts. The catches were that you couldn't invoke the mode until you were at 25% or below, you needed to sacrifice your current character, shifting the boost to your reserve character and the mode only lasted seven seconds. And if you didn't KO your opponent before Pandora Mode ended, your character dropped instead. In practice, this turned out to be more "Death" than "Glory", as seven seconds was nowhere near enough time to take down an opponent who wasn't already significantly damaged (making it almost useless for the comeback mechanic it was meant to be) and even if you were in the middle of a round-finishing Super Art, if the mode ended before the combo did, you still lost. A major game update made the mode last longer, but the other drawbacks remained.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jigglypuff's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cfqRFU1ZyY">Rest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> attack and Luigi's Super Jump Punch can both easily inflict a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>, but <em>only</em> if they are used at absolutely point-blank range. Otherwise, they inflict <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> at best. Jigglypuff's Rest also puts it to sleep for about two full seconds (whether it connects or not), and Luigi's Jump Punch is also his mid-air recovery move, which makes it risky to use anywhere that isn't above solid stage ground.
</li><li> Captain Falcon's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">Falcon Punch</a> has a long windup period (almost one full second) before it strikes, making it easy for a player to avoid or interrupt it. But if it hits...
</li><li> Ganondorf's Warlock Punch is stronger than Falcon's Punch, but requires even <em>more</em> time to execute before it hits. However, a sucessful strike will hurt; <em>a lot</em>. The same happens with his Volcano Kick. Again, it does a <em>lot</em> of damage and can K.O. very early; however, it has the longest charge of any one attack though, and Ganondorf's completely immobile during it.
</li><li> Roy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Melee</a></em> has his version of Shield Breaker (Explosion), which is a charged sword strike. While Marth's version of the attack is quicker and can KO an opponent at decent damage, Roy's takes a ridiculously long time to power up and takes 10% after using it. However, when used at full power, can instantly K.O. pretty well anybody, provided he's not interrupted that is.
</li><li> <em>Brawl</em> adds Ike, who combines Marth and Roy's charging attacks with slow, Ganondorf-style attacks. His entire game is about timing and distancing, and if he gets them right, the battle can be quite short.
</li><li> Toon Link's downthrust aerial attack sends him plummeting straight down, sword first. The attack is a very powerful spike, but like Luigi's Super Jump Punch, if he doesn't have solid ground to land on, it's a one-way ticket off the stage.
</li><li> <em>3DS/Wii U</em> adds Shulk, who via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StanceSystem">Stance System</a> can turn himself into quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>. Activating Monado Smash makes it so his attacks get very increased knockback, which is a godsend in a game where launching people off the screen is the name of the game. However, this stance makes it easy for opponents to send <em>him</em> flying away, which means that if Shulk is also highly damaged, Monado Smash can easily backfire.
</li><li> Any character with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">Counter-Attack</a> means they have in their arsenal a way to painfully punish any incoming attack. However, activating these attacks turns the fighter into a sitting duck for a good while if they are not attacked in the usually strict window of time the counter is effective, and they are ineffective against any kind of grab.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">Hammers</a> became this after the original. <em>Melee</em> started the tradition with the normal hammer losing its head sometimes, becoming a useless piece of wood. By the time you're done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/Smashtasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/Smashtasm">flailing a stick around and don't know how to stop</a>, someone else will have already picked up the head and thrown it at you or someone else, or just taunted you for ten seconds at making a fool out of yourself. <em>Brawl</em> made it even worse; if someone picks up the shiny new Golden Hammer, <em>run</em>. One hit, or two at best, and you will be eliminated before you can say squeak... assuming <em>the hammer</em> doesn't beat you to it. The cute sound of a squeaky hammer won't be so cute after an opponent sends you off the screen.
</li><li> <em>4</em> adds "Extreme Judge", a variation of Mr. Game &amp; Watch's Judge attack that makes it either hit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">extremely hard</a> or not at all.
</li></ul></li><li> In most American football video games, calling an all-out blitz can result in nailing the opponent for a big loss. A successful blitz can swing a game's momentum in your favor. If you can't reach the ball carrier, it can swing the other way, as it leaves large gaps in the defense and plenty of uncovered players to act as blockers.
<ul><li> <em>Madden 21</em> gives Kansas City QB Patrick Mahomes the "Bazooka" special ability, which allows him to throw nearly the length of the football field. However, the player has to buy time for his receivers to run by scrambling around in the backfield, meaning it will either be a huge bomb for a touchdown or a massive sack.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> moves come to mind:
<ul><li> The best examples are Fissure, Guillotine, Sheer Cold and Horn Drill. They only have a 30% chance to hit, but if they do, your opponent is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">one-shotted.</a> Guillotine and Horn Drill don't work on Ghost types unless you use some form of workaround strategy. Sheer Cold is Ice type and the most dangerous of them all because no type is immune. Fissure, being a ground type move, suffers from Flying types and Levitate and Air Balloon users being immune. But otherwise, landing one of these WILL knock out an opponent's Pokémon. If you miss (70% chance), you just gave your opponent a free turn, which can prove devastating. These three moves are banned from competitive play because of how cheap the victories can be with them in use. There are moves such as Protect or Detect that block the attack, the withstanding move Endure that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastChanceHitPoint">spares 1 HP</a>, the item Focus Sash which does the same, and the effects of the ability Sturdy, which makes it impossible for 1-hit KO.
</li><li> "(High) Jump Kick" hurts the user by one-half of the damage it would have inflicted if they miss. In an early Battle CD from <em>Gale of Darkness</em>, you actually have to use this to your advantage - the opponent is ridiculously powerful and can knock you out in one hit, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay">the fixed pattern of attacks</a> - it uses three elemental punches, then High Jump kick, and you have a Blissey (who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">silly amount of HP</a>) with a move that blocks any attack, but loses its chances of success with repeated use - means a single blocked attack is all it takes to finish the foe.
<ul><li> In Generation V, the damage from missing is changed from one-half the damage it would have done to one-half of the user's maximum HP. Probably because of the above scenario, and a boost in its base firepower (to 130, after already being boosted from 85 to 100 in Generation IV).
</li></ul></li><li> Ghosts can use Curse to inflict an incurable status which can eat through the foe's hp frighteningly quickly. The downside is that the user takes a nail to the eye for 50% of its health bar, making it rather easy for the enemy to finish the job (but making it harder to catch wild Ghost Pokes that use it, since they tend to pass out).
</li><li> Several attacks require two turns to execute. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Sadly</a>, they're rarely powerful enough to make up for wasting the first turn (Razor Wind, Skull Bash). Then there's Solar Beam, which doesn't need a turn to charge if the weather is sunny, though causing sunny weather takes up a turn itself and if your opponent is faster and changes the weather, you're boned. Then there's moves where you're semi-invulnerable the first turn (Dig, Fly, Dive), though there are always a few moves that can still damage you (as well as a few that will cause extra damage (Earthquake against Dig, Twister or Hurricane against Fly, Surf against Dive)). None of those two-turn moves are very popular in competitive play, simply because the opponent will be able to switch to a Pokémon that resists or is outright immune to the attack, and has a good chance of being highly capable of mopping the floor with the two-turn-move-user (the exception being Gyarados's Bounce and Origin Forme Giratina's Shadow Force, since both Pokémon are powerful enough to justify the use of such moves). However, there is an item called a <em>Power Herb</em> that skips the charge up and allows to attack without it, but A) These aren't available until post-game, and B) It disappears after use.
<ul><li> Hyper Beam (and its many variants, like Rock Wrecker, Roar of Time, and Giga Impact) are inversions of the usual two-turn attacks: They strike first and require a recharge turn <em>later</em>. They inflict massive damage, but the extra turn required to recover it can prove fatal in fierce competitive settings. (On the other hand, the extra turn is a moot point if you're about to get KO'ed anyway...) Also, anything with at least 75 Base Power (which is rather mediocre) does at least as much damage over two turns, landing these attacks <em><strong>firmly</strong></em> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">Cool, but Inefficient</a> category. They're only useful if you <em>desperately</em> need an OHKO.
</li></ul></li><li> And there are moves which sharply reduce the user's stats after use, which can make your Pokémon practically useless afterwards (e.g. Draco Meteor and Overheat sharply reduce attack power after use) or vulnerable to enemy attacks (Close Combat, which reduces defense).
</li><li> Then there's Bide. For two turns, your Pokémon doesn't do a thing. On the third turn, he'll attack, doing exactly twice as much damage to the opponent as the opponent did to your Pokémon during those two turns. Unless your Pokémon hasn't taken any damage because your opponent was too busy buffing its own stats in order to be more able to crush you. Or it did crush you before you could strike back. Or your Pokémon is suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">confusion or paralysis or something similar</a> and quite simply fails to use the move
</li><li> There's also the recoil damage attacks (Jump Kick and High Jump Kick not included, since they do a different kind of recoil damage), which do damage to the user whenever it hits. And they all do pretty good damage; none of them naturally have a power lower than <strong>80</strong>, 5 of them have a power of 120, and one has a power of 150. But the damage they do to the user is pretty hefty; all but one of them does 1/3 of the damage its user dealt, and the other one, Head Smash (the most powerful one), deals <em><strong>half</strong></em> the damage the opponent took. Imagine how much Rampardos (who has the third highest base Attack in the game, beat only by Attack Forme Deoxys and Black Kyurem; oh, and he also gets a 50% damage increase since Head Smash is a Rock attack and Rampardos is a Rock Pokémon) is hurting after using it.
<ul><li> And then there's Normal-type Struggle, which is used by Pokémon who've run out of PP for all their moves. On the plus side, it ignores the opponent's type, so you can still use it on Pokemon that resist or are immune to Normal attacks. Unfortunately, the recoil damage is pretty hefty: as of Generation IV, the user takes damage equal to 1/4 of their <strong>max HP</strong> every time it hits, regardless of how much damage it dealt.
</li></ul></li><li> Shadow End from <em>Pokémon XD</em>. It's powerful (120 power Shadow move, doubled to <em><strong>240</strong></em> against regular Pokémon), but the user's current HP is cut in half whenever it hits. That, and a base accuracy of 60% make it less reliable than Thunder or Blizzard.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Zap Cannon</a>. 100 power (120 in Generation V), instant paralysis, but only 50% accuracy. Dynamic Punch is the same, only it's Fighting-type and confuses. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> also gives us the move Inferno, which is Fire-type and causes a burn. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Focus Punch</a> is a 150 power fighting move, but goes second and fails if the user is hit.
<ul><li> When used on its own, Focus Punch is practically useless outside of very specific circumstances. As of Gen V, we have the move <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/After_You">After You<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>... Granted, this only makes the move a lot more reliable in double and triple battles.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also Outrage and variations thereof, which inflict massive damage for 2-3 turns, but after that the user becomes confused.
<ul><li> Focus Punch becomes <em>very</em> useful if you make it so the opponent can't attack you directly - so put the enemy to sleep or use Substitute, and...
</li></ul></li><li> Belly Drum is a 'Death or Glory <em>Buff</em>'. In order to use it, you must sacrifice half your total HP, if you can't then the move fails. If it succeeds however, you get <em>maximized physical attack power</em>, with which you can deal 4x regular damage with any physical move... Assuming you live long enough to attack. Move first and you need to hope your opponent cannot hit you for the rest of your HP, move second and you run the risk of either not being able to use the move at all, or not being able to respond due to the speed difference.
</li><li> The aptly named Final Gambit attack falls under this: This move will knock out the Pokémon that uses it but is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedDamageAttack">Fixed Damage Attack</a>—that fixed damage being the amount of HP the Pokémon had when it used Final Gambit. It can knock out an opposing Pokémon who might have previously been at a disadvantage...or it might not and you'd have lost one of your own Pokémon for nothing.
</li><li> Endeavor is the opposite of Final Gambit: It, too, is a fixed damage attack. The fixed damage is the opponent's HP minus the user's HP, meaning that after using it, both the user and its target will have the same amount of HP. Of course, this means that the opponent will be next to attack, so you'd better have something ready for that.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms II</a>, Han Xuan is a ruler with terrible, terrible stats (21/34/12, all three on a scale from 10 to 100), meaning that he's dumb as a brick, useless in battle, and horrible at raising an officer's loyalty. One way of dealing with that ("The ultimate gamble") is to invade a neighbor and immediately retreat to an empty province, leaving the much better Huang Zhong (66/96/83) as his home province's governor. What's the catch? Huang Zhong starts with only 78 loyalty, and will be in charge for one turn before you can fix that. During that month there's the risk of someone else recruiting him (and therefore the province) — which would mean losing your non-joke province, all officers except Han Xuan, all your soldiers, and virtually all your gold and food.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has a villainous example. Icehowl, a gigantic yeti fought in the Trial of the Crusader raid, has an attack where he scatters and stuns the raid against the walls, then targets a person and charges him/her. If the target (or anyone else) is hit by the charge, Icehowl goes into a rage and gains a massive damage and speed buff. If he misses, Icehowl crashes into the wall and is stunned himself for several seconds, and he takes double damage from all attacks. Considering his massive amount of health, you want him to always miss if you want to beat the enrage timer.
<ul><li> In <em>World of Warcraft</em> the priest spell Shadow Word: Death deals damage to an opponent, but if it fails to kill them hurts the priest as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Desperate Attack in Duel fights in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em>; it does a <em>lot</em> of damage, but if your opponent chose Guard in the rock-paper-scissors, you're going to eat a counter. (Defeating Teo with Pahn in the first game, a seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessBossFight">Hopeless Boss Fight</a> that must be won to get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, is best done by choosing only Guard — Teo eventually flips out and starts using Desperate Attack exclusively.)
</li><li> Yoshimitsu of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soulcalibur</a></em> series (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">predecessor</a> of the <em>Tekken</em> character mentioned above) has an attack where he stabs himself through with his own sword — akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seppuku">ritualistic disembowelment</a> — losing the round, if he kills himself. If it kills an enemy conveniently standing behind him during the stab, however, the round win goes to Yoshimitsu, even if he dies from his own move.
<ul><li> There are also attacks denoted by an exclamation mark on the character's move list. Said attacks are massively telegraphed (with the screen dimming and the character's weapon being covered in flames and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckingInLines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuckingInLines">Sucking-In Lines</a>) and take a while to execute, but deal massive damage and smash right through guards.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em>, each class has a "taunt" attack that is an instant kill if it actually connects. However, it requires them to stand in one place for several seconds completely defenseless.
<ul><li> Of course, if you can time it just right, you can kill someone coming through a doorway with one of these taunts by standing out of their sight behind a wall. A guaranteed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment if there ever was one.
</li><li> The Pyro's taunt also has a distinctive charge-up sound and animation. The Spy is similar, although he says a generic line instead of shouting. The charge-ups for the other taunts are silent and usually less noticeable.
</li><li> Don't confuse these attacks with the Spy's instant-kill backstab or the Sniper's ability to one-shot enemies.
</li><li> The Sniper's ability to one-shot enemies <em>can</em> be used for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a>, if you're a good enough shot to stand your ground and blow the enemy Heavy's head off at point blank range instead of running away.
</li><li> The Sniper's Taunt can actually be useful since it's actually two successive attacks in a row. The first one does miniscule damage, but paralyzes the target for the second half and has priority over every other attack. This is extremely useful if a Demoman is charging your way, as you will literally stop him in his tracks (he can only slightly nudge his direction, but otherwise cannot change his path) and get off an insta-kill if no one else is around.
</li><li> The Soldier has a weapon (the Equalizer) which does more damage the less health he has. Either you'll kill that Heavy in a single massive hit or you'll die because you're running around below 25HP. Also, taunting with this weapon causes the Soldier to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Action Bomb</a>, blowing himself up with an otherwise-unusable grenade and taking any enemies nearby with him.
</li><li> The Scout's taunt kill is perhaps the most rewarding of them all. It takes about 5 seconds to use, the longest taunt kill in the game. He calls a (baseball) shot, Babe Ruth-style, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp">swings his bat</a>. Hitting someone with this taunt kill in an open area can launch their corpse well over 100 feet, and is hilarious when it happens due to its rarity, and the fact that seeing some guy's body fly clean across dustbowl is hilarious.
<ul><li> In January 2011, an update gave the Scout a new melee weapon to use: the Boston Basher. Hit an enemy with it, and he gets hit hard with an additional bleed effect. Swing it at thin air, and you hit yourself for half as much direct damage and an equal amount of bleeding that can equal nearly half your health.
</li></ul></li><li> A Pyro attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDeflector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDeflector">airblast</a> a projectile at point blank is very difficult—and with a bad connection literally impossible—but if successful will take off a <em>very</em> large piece of his target's health (a Sniper using the Huntsman can even be one-hit KO'd this way). If not successful the Pyro just lost at least half of <em>his</em> health and may not even be able to attack again before he's finished off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleForWesnoth">Battle for Wesnoth</a></em> has the Dwarvish Ulfserker/Berserker line, which instead of stopping after an exchange of the standard number of strikes like other units will simply keep fighting right until either it or its opponent is dead. (Thankfully this applies in melee only as the unit has no ability to strike or retaliate at range.) A lesser but still valid example are units with the Charge ability (double damage on the attack in exchange for doubled damage taken in return as well), especially the basic Horseman and its Lancer upgrade which <em>only</em> have a charge attack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokaponKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokaponKingdom">Dokapon Kingdom</a></em> and <em>Dokapon Journey</em>, every character you control or fight has a move called "Strike", which usually does enough damage to bring down a full-health enemy of the same level as the person using it. However, should the character on the receiving end counter it (using a move of the same name), the <em>attacker</em> gets the damage instead. It doesn't necessarily kill, but characters can kill enemies of much higher level than themselves by getting a lucky counter on the defense and then finishing off the opponent with their attack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>, the sword tech "Mortal Draw" works like this. To use it, you must walk up to an enemy with your sword sheathed, and then press A when prompted during a small window. If it hits, you kill almost any enemy in one strike. If you mistime it, then the enemy gets a free strike at you.
<ul><li> Similarly, facing a certain charge attack from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> will prompt you with "chance" and to press A, which enters you into a (completely optional) button-mashing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeLock">Blade Lock</a> event with him. If you miss the "chance" window and fail to get out of the way, then you get hit with the brunt of the attack. If you fail the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeLock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeLock">Blade Lock</a>, he'll take away a chunk of your health. But if you succeed both of those, you're well on your way to killing him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em>'s "Battle of the Champions" DLC, you are given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">"One-Hit Obliterator"</a>, a four-pronged, one-handed trident-style weapon that can one-shot up to two opponents while the weapon is charged. But it charges itself by draining your health down to one-quarter of one heart. Using that weapon means one of you is going down in one hit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em> has the aptly-named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a></em> fairy magic. Activating it drastically increases the warrior's damage output (<strong>x8</strong>), but practically removes their defense, and a single tick of damage will leave the warrior with one-fourth of a heart left.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Punch-Out!!</a></em> series, Bald Bull's Bull Charge will end with a knockdown for one of you. You can try to dodge the attack, but Bald Bull will just reset and keep trying to charge at you until you try to counter him with a punch to the gut. Succeed, and he goes down. Fail, and <em>you</em> go down. While seemingly averted in the Wii version of the game, where he'll avoid an instant knock-out from it in his Title Defense mode rematch, he'll still leave himself wide open for the star punch you earn from countering it, which if timed properly, will either KO him temporarily or put him down for the count if it's a three-star punch.
<ul><li> While not quite an attack, in two-player mode you can become Giga Mac. You have much more power, but your punches do take longer, you can't dodge anything, and standing still for too long gives your opponent a chance to get star punches. A good opponent can actually knock you out even when you're in Giga Mac mode. The two taunts, that replace dodging, could also count — Manage to get the taunt done, and you get a star punch and more time as Giga Mac respectively; three star punches as Giga Mac give you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">OHKO</a> move, and you could theoretically carry on as Giga Mac for the entire match with the "Juice" taunt. However, If your opponent manages to punch you, you lose all your stars, and they either get a star or knock half your time away. Getting hit with a star punch while taunting has an even worse effect, resulting either in a instant KO or an instant win for your opponent for a normal star punch and three-star punch respectively.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SwordOfTheSamurai">Sword of the Samurai</a></em> Kenjutsu minigame, there's a "power attack" that causes two hits instead of one (opponents can only take 4 hits in total before succumbing). Unfortunately, it was extremely hard to perform with the lackluster controls, and the A.I. was adept at blocking them even when performed very quickly.
</li><li> The Royal Release from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry3DantesAwakening">Devil May Cry 3</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">4</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry5">5</a></em>. It can deal awesome, <strong>awesome</strong> damage to even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Dante Must Die</a> bosses. However, you must first build up a meter, preferably by blocking enemies' attacks at the exact moment when they would connect, and then unleash it also when an enemy's attack would connect. Fail to meet the timing and not only is the damage reduced significantly, but Dante also loses the invulnerability frames a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">successful</a> Royal Release would have. Massive hurt on Dante tends to ensue.

<ul><li> Attempting to kill the Witch with a headshot (also known as Cr0wning due to the achievement you earn for pulling this off). Normally, the Witch turns the game in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a>: she sits there, crying, until someone upsets her by getting too close or shooting her, at which point she pins down the player who set her off and attacks them (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> on expert difficulty).

</li><li> The Tank has the ability to hurl large chunks of concrete at the survivors, which allows him to attack at range for good damage and chance to hit. The animation however takes a whole 3 seconds for lifting and throwing the rock, leaving him wide open for survivor gunfire.
</li><li> Likewise the Tank's Boulder can be shot out of the air, but it takes a few shots to do so, and unless it's coming directly at you, it's probably better to just run. If it connects, however, it will stun you long enough so that the tank can get to you, so it's sometimes worth taking that shot if you have no other options (or if the tank's a really good shot).
</li></ul></li><li> With the appropriate weapons mods and ammunition, sniper rifles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">Mass Effect</a></em> can deal absurd amounts of damage—if you don't mind them overheating after one shot. You're not truly helpless, but you won't be shooting again for a second or two while your unfortunate victim's allies exact revenge.
<ul><li> The Vanguard class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> is described as being this, a "high risk, high reward" class that rushes the front lines. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a>,</em> the Vanguard's class ability is Charge, which biotically propels the player from anywhere (with a clear line of sight) to the enemy, ramming into them with incredible force. This can take them out, put a shot-gun wielding player in close- or it could lead to the player getting completely swarmed. It tends to go one way or the other, but this trope really shows when the player <em>intentionally</em> charges one enemy in the middle of an entire group. At higher levels, Charge also adds extra shield protection once it lands; since the shotguns have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">a tighter spread</a> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRangeShotgun">in most games,</a> a Vanguard with bad aim will be mowed down quickly. A Vanguard with <em>good</em> aim will splat entire enemy squads after they come out of Charge before their extra barriers fail.

With the right upgrades the Vanguard's charge cooldown is under 3 seconds, allowing them to repeatedly charge/nova enemies to death while remaining nigh-invulnerable to anything short of massed enemy fire or a one hit kill ability from an enemy. Vanguards don't even need to carry a gun by that point.

There are moves to immobilize opponents, instantly cause Break status on them, summon a giant meteor to fall on them, etc. Of course they all require you to charge up for several seconds with no defense for counter-attack. These moves are actually effective against the AI because they're liable to just stand and watch you charge up your kill move, or can be "tricked" in various ways into being unable to do anything about it, usually by exploiting the stage — human opponents know better, of course, so don't expect to see any of these moves go off in a PvP match.

<ul><li> The Emperor's Starfall attack became more usable in the sequel, ue to gaining a property that stops ranged Bravery attacks, forcing the enemy to close in on him, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrapMaster">may play into his hand</a>. Meanwhile, Exdeath's Maelstrom is almost never intended as an actual <em>attack</em>, rather as bait to make the enemy try an attack, which Exdeath can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">counter</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em> has the Nuke. Assuming you can get the Ghost into enemy territory undetected, and he can survive the ten-second call to target the Nuke, <em>and</em> you can afford the time and resources to build the Nuke itself, the Nuclear Strike is guaranteed to kill all units and severely damage all buildings within a considerable radius.
<ul><li> Certain early-game rushes also qualify as this. A player may opt to build a fast unit-producing building (that may be near the enemy base, in the case of Terran/Protoss) and forgo peon production for an extremely early attack. If they're successful, they'll either outright win the game, or at least severely cripple the opponent's economy. If they don't do enough damage or get scouted early, their own economy will likely be in such poor shape from not building workers that they will be way behind on the tech tree, if the opponent doesn't come after them with a fast counterattack to flatten them right away.
</li><li> For a specific example in competitive <em>StarCraft</em>, master player Boxer's famous "SCV Rush" was one of these. Boxer sent literally every unit he had, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkerUnit">Worker Units</a>, at his opponent's base and managed a win, since his opponent was spending all his resources on early expansions. If he had been mistaken in his timing, or if his opponent had had more defenses than he expected, that move would likely have cost him the game, since he essentially sacrificed his entire economy for an early strike.

If you're trying to stop a Distortion Drive or Astral Heat, failure will hurt a lot. It does not help that some Distortion Drives and Astral Heats have unusual timing so you cannot just blindly use the super flash buffer technique.

The most notable being Reimu Hakurei's "Fantasy Heaven" Spell Card. When activated, seven orbs surround Reimu and with each successful melee attack, one orb lights up. When all orbs lights up... holy crap, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">you are already dead</a>. In <em>SWR</em>, this move cannot be fully grazed and will do <em>massive damage</em>, and in <em>Hisoutensoku</em>, there is nearly no chance of surviving the move once it's activated, even with a full health bar (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">the move can potentially do 18000 damage, your maximum health is 10000</a>). Sounds good huh? Problem is, the spell costs all your current spell cards, the time is limited, and if your enemy is smart enough to know what you are doing and run away from you during this time, it is simply impossible to activate the move.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonFighterOnline">Dungeon Fighter Online</a></em>, the Asura class sports Ground Shaker and Agni Pentacle. Both can potentially end any duel should they hit, but if the Asura wiffs, they are left completely immobile and defenseless for a good 3-5 seconds in which time they likely <strong>will</strong> be killed.

If a character successfully connects with one of these, it can cause devastating damage to the opponent. This can be ruined by not activating the skill before the mana meter runs out (in which case you'll have to charge it up again by fighting), or activating the skill and missing (causing the Holy Grail to disappear for the rest of the round).

<ul><li> The "glory" part comes from the second half of the bank hack, if you do it early in the game. The first half, transferring the money to your account, is relatively easy. The glory comes when you use your ill-gotten gains to purchase the programs you need to hastily cover your tracks, along with re-hacking the bank and so on.

Most d-style moves require exceptionally good timing, the opponent to be in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">specific position or animation</a>, or just dumb luck.

Either one — or even both if you're especially daring — is most useful in boss fights, where one of you is going to die in a scant few seconds (or in the case of the former, if you're going for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDamageRun">No-Damage Run</a> anyway).

Fail and you lose half your cash in fees. Not that much of a problem when you're chucking in two grand. Later in the game, you're dealing with millions of dollars. It's just safer, in many cases, to hold onto the cash, risk losing it in death and spend what you can on the 'Exotics' menu (which provides other benefits). Drug deals use the same mechanic - if you fail, you spend the same amount of money but get only half the yeyo. If you <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalFailure">critically</a></em> fail, negotiations break down and the dealer's gang attacks you.

It boosts the power of her individual units by 100%, allowing her to take on opponents of much higher levels. The drawback is that it knocks her lifepoints down to 10% of her max, so one solid hit will kill her. Note that in earlier versions of the game, Fiona could refill her life points to full, with the Vampire elite units and a bit of luck. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam">Steam</a> version closed that loophole by hard capping her HP at 10% of maximum.

If the opponent gets close enough to sweep you, you're in trouble. <em>But...</em> it has a <em>far</em> longer range than it looks, and deals <em>ridiculous</em> damage. Either you're leaving yourself wide open or you're winning the round.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman">Hitman</a></em> franchise is the EMBODIMENT of this trope. Simply taking your weapon out in public is a virtual death sentence, as you are likely to be slaughtered, and even attempting to make your way to your target on higher difficulties will either go perfectly well or leave you failing critically.
</li><li> The Sniper Minirobot from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiniRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MiniRobotWars">Mini Robot Wars</a></em>. It shoots an extremely fast and damaging bullet at any enemy machine that enters its attack range. The catch is that said attack has a chance of missing completely, and the shot interval time is quite long. If he fails to hit the stronger enemies such as Mega Smashers, you can kiss your defenses goodbye if you don't have a ready bomb on hand.
<ul><li> Thankfully, this gets averted once he gets the Eagle Eye upgrade, which makes all his shots hit no matter what.

The union will also avoid almost every attack, until the limit break is used. So using these attacks instead of healing while on low health will guarantee a huge amount of damage to your enemy, and then leave you completely open to counterattack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastScenario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LastScenario">Last Scenario</a></em> has the Brutal Attack spellcard, which deals massive amounts of damage, but also damages the user. It's entirely possible for the user to KO themselves if they don't have enough HP to survive it. It's also possible for the user to miss with either the attack or the damage dealt to themselves, which can lead to either the character hurting themselves for nothing, or dealing big damage with no consequences.
</li><li> Counter Hypers in <em>Ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em> have pretty much unbeatable priority and do great damage, but have to be timed perfectly (excruciatingly difficult in Online Mode) and if you fail, you lose precious Hyper meter.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Phoenix Wright</a> is a Death or Glory <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeCharacter">character</a></em>. His entire playstyle hinges on you being able to hold the enemy off until he can gather the Evidence necessary to enter Turnabout Mode, but this is so difficult very few players can pull it off with anything even approaching regularity. If you manage to pull it off, however, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Wright becomes an absolute beast</a> who can spam powerful projectiles, juggle you with his powered-up heavy attacks and gives you access to one of the hardest-hitting Level 3 specials in the entire game.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgrammingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgrammingGame">Programming Game</a> <em>RoboWar</em>, the "killshot" was a major part of strategy, and was made possible in part by the ability of robots to expend in one turn up to 200 more points of energy on anything than they actually had. By putting enough energy into bullets or missiles, they could at least theoretically be strong enough to kill any opponent, but having negative energy made a robot a comatose sitting duck until it recovered.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootEmUp">Shoot Em Ups</a> have player ships which shoot a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreadShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreadShot">Spread Shot</a> that fans out as they travel. As a result, the closer you are to an enemy, the more of your shots connect. The logical extreme is known as "shotgunning" or "point blanking", where you fly up <em>extremely</em> close to an enemy to shoot it point blank for maximum damage. The obvious downside is that you'll have no time to react, in a genre where you're usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, so even the slightest mistake while shotgunning usually means instant death. Some games also provide additional rewards for it:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a> 13: Ten Desires</em>, bosses drop blue and gray spirit items as they take damage, and the closer you get, the more spirit items they drop.

If his shot connects, he'll likely kill the enemy. If his shot fails, then he's exposed himself, and possibly drawn the attention of many more hostiles. The Assault class actually specializes in these tactics, particularly when armed with a shotgun and using the Run And Gun skill (which allows for two movement actions and a shooting action), allowing them to run up to the enemy, vault over their cover, and blast them at point-blank range. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> by the Assault's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em> counterpart, the Ranger. Melee attacks put them right in the face of the enemy, meaning that a failed attack will be even more severely punished than before, but if a Ranger successfully gets a kill and has the Implacable skill, he gets another move to find better cover, while the Untouchable skill will let him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> the first attempt to counter. Both these skills require a kill. So Rangers are even further up shit creek if they screw up, but benefit even more from a success.

Normally, this wouldn't be enough to qualify for this trope, but in this game landing a critical hit earns you an extra turn icon, while missing an attack makes you lose an additional turn icon and has a chance to inflict a powerful buff on the enemy. Given that the game also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocketTagGameplay">Rocket-Tag Gameplay</a> where even normal enemies from several dungeons ago can be a threat, one missed attack can hurt your party a lot.

However, if Batman hits the charging enemy with a batarang, it's an instant KO.

The boss starts the fight by unleashing a massive, yet sluggish attack; while it makes its way to Mario and Luigi, he'll start shooting lesser attacks to distract them. Eventually, the first attack will approach one of the brothers, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ludwig</span> will keep firing until it's two seconds away from impact. If nothing is done, the attack will deal 999 damage to both characters regardless of stats or equipment, instantly killing them.

<ul><li> The Jester's "Finale" is very much meant to be used to finish a battle (in fact it can only be used once per battle) and also unlike the Hellion's attacks automatically moves him to the very back of the hero team formation.

<ul><li> Deathwing is a monstrous 12/12 that destroys every other minion on board and discards your entire hand when played. If the opponent is caught unprepared, Deathwing can easily end the game by himself with his raw power, but if the opponent is prepared with, say, a removal spell... he's still ended the game by himself, because with no hand and no other minions, you're not going to have a plan B.
</li><li> Yogg-Saron, Hope's End casts a random spell on a random target - including himself - for each spell you previously played during the game. This means he can do basically anything from outright killing your opponent, to nuking their board, to filling your board and drawing a bunch of cards, to killing <em>you</em>, to any outcome in between. This results in a card that can win you the game, screw you over completely, or do absolutely nothing (the latter becoming much more likely after Yogg was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> to stop casting spells if he kills himself).

The only one who ties with him is Estelle but hers only targets one enemy. Unfortunately it costs 100 CP to transform Rean into his ogre form and it only lasts for three turns before he reverts back to his main self, which is why the form is only good for unleashing a 200 CP S-Craft. Then this is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in <em>Cold Steel IV</em> where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after the three turns are up, he's uncontrollable and will only attack enemies without the player's input.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">King Elizabello</a>'s King Punch technique is this: It takes one <em>hour</em> to charge, but when he lands one, it is one of the most destructive techniques seen in the whole series—an undercharged King Punch was shown to vaporize a city block, and a fully-charged King Punch can disintegrate fortresses the size of mountains. However, it's risky on two fronts: The first is that the king requires aides in combat to defend him, as the charge time is so long and he's helpless when charging; and the second is that he is completely out of power after a King Punch, meaning anyone who manages to stand up to or evade the King Punch can then defeat him with ease.
</li><li> Chopper's Monster Point technique is also one of these. This transformation gives him monstrous strength, but causes him to lose control over his mind, drains his life force at an extremely rapid rate, and renders him immobile after the transformation wears off.

</li><li> Gecko Moria's "Shadow's Asgard" also qualifies. With this technique, Moria absorbs every single shadow he has stolen via the power of his devil fruit, but in doing so, he also kills off every single zombie on the Thriller Bark. He turns into a hulking brute that rivals the giant zombie Oars in size, but this strength comes at the expense of speed - Moria is practically unable to hit Luffy in Gear 2. In addition, whenever he's hit hard enough, Moria regurgitates some shadows, lowering his strength as the shadows return to their owners.

<ul><li> In general, any strategy that focuses on offense over defense falls under this, especially in team sports. Specific examples include:
</li><li> The blitz in gridiron football, which is when one or more extra defenders are sent after the quarterback in order to force a sack or worse. Done badly, it leaves receivers wide open for big offensive plays.
<ul><li> Two particularly high-risk variations:
<ul><li> Corner Blitz: Sending a the cornerback in after the quarterback, usually done to the QB's blind side. If spotted, at best (for the defense) the receiver is going to have a mismatch downfield (covered by a linebacker or safety not fast enough to keep him from getting the ball with room to spare). At worst, he's completely uncovered with room to run.
</li><li> The All-Out or "Jailbreak" Blitz: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> of football. Basically sending every defender after the QB. Rarely seen in modern football above the high school level because of the insane risk (basically you nail the QB for a huge loss or they score an easy touchdown).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Replacing the goaltender with a regular player in ice hockey gives the team an advantage in attacking the other team's goal while leaving their net wide open. Another strategy, which is somewhat common on the powerplay, has one or both defensemen replaced with forwards so they can use the position on the ice for clear shots from the point, the downside being that they're less competent on defense which increases the risk of a shorthanded opportunity for the other team.
<ul><li> On the other hand, pulling the goalie on a delayed penalty is a nearly zero-risk proposition, because the play will be blown dead as soon as the other team touches the puck. The only way it can backfire is if a member of your team accidentally sends the puck into your own unguarded net. Otherwise, pulling the goalie is almost exclusively a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a> to tie the game late in the third period. Since there's no downside to losing by two goals instead of one, you have nothing to lose by pulling the goalie to try to tie the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Made harder in association football due to the off-side rule being based on where the team's defensive players are, however, like ice hockey, bringing the goalkeeper forward gives the team a numerical advantage in attacking while leaving the net open.
</li><li> A <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y98ukMekKdA">riposte<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (or <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLoeVQ28IRo">kaeshi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> if you must) can be like this. It's really cool if you pull it off, but if you mess up prepare to look stupid.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W76VUwIC10Y">A Fleche<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in French fencing is like this. The attacker runs at his opponent, leaps and attacks, then runs past as he lands. If executed properly, it's almost impossible to parry. If done improperly, the attacker is wide open for a counterattack. If done <em>really</em> badly, one or both of you will end up in a heap on the floor...
</li><li> A squeeze play in baseball is when the batter attempts to bunt while a runner at third base takes off for home plate. If the batter bunts the ball correctly, the fielders will all be out of place and be unable to scoop the bunted ball up and send it home before the runner from third scores; if the batter doesn't (either by bunting right to a fielder or being unable to bunt the ball at all), the runner is almost certainly going to be tagged out at home. This is especially so if it's a "suicide squeeze" play (the runner takes off for home as soon as the pitcher starts his delivery) rather than a "safety squeeze" (the runner waits to see if the ball is bunted well before taking off for home).
</li><li> The aptly-named 'Suicide Leap' in <em>Extreme Dodgeball</em> is part this and part <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>. The attacking player leaps over the centre line to close the distance between them and their opponent to point blank range. On the one hand, they are out as soon as they land for crossing the centre line, but while they are in the air they are still live. On the other, should they somehow miss or the ball is caught, their team loses a player, and possibly gives the opponents another player. For this reason it was used to end a round by eliminating the final player on the opponents' team.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> had the Japanese do this repeatedly due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">overinflated sense of honor.</a> They also serve as an object lesson for its overuse, as the Japanese military's prodigality with trained veterans ended up tanking their war effort.
</li><li> Another WWII example, and a particularly extreme one, is the atomic bomb itself. Before the test detonations, the people who built it hypothesized that it <em>might</em> blow up a lot of bad guys and win the war... or it might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetTheWorldOnFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetTheWorldOnFire">ignite the atmosphere</a> and wipe out all life on planet Earth. They did evaluate the likeliness of the scenario before going for it.
</li><li> A non-military example: very large trades on the Chicago commodities exchanges are known as "O'Hare trades" (after the airport). Essentially you sign the deal, then immediately head for the airport, if the deal works in your favor, you turn the plane around and collect your money; if the deal goes against you, you are already halfway to a non-extradition country. To elaborate, commodities futures are highly leveraged — a small down payment for a contract to buy or sell a large amount of the underlying commodity (wheat, corn, whatever) on the expiration date; you are essentially betting big that the price of the commodity is going to rise or fall. If it goes in your favor, you can sell your contract (or the underlying) for a substantial profit. However, if it goes against you, you are stuck putting up cash you may not actually have in order to cover your losses.
</li><li> There are many examples in MMA and fighting in general. For example, a haymaker thrown with all your might will most likely knock your opponent out if it lands, but your movements will tell your opponent what you're about to do, and you leave yourself open to a number of counters. Likewise, a flying submission can end a fight quickly, unexpectedly, and stylishly, but if it fails, you'll find yourself on your back with your opponent on top of you, likely raining down punches.
</li><li> High kicks. Easily punished, but with the power of the kick and hitting the head it's not pretty for the guy it connects against. This extends to aerial attacks such as jump kicks, but <em>especially</em> drop kicks. When they work, you have directed most if not all of your body weight to a single point on an opponent's upper body at some rather unpleasant velocity. Fail, and you will very likely land in an awkward position and/or hurt yourself, leaving you at the mercy of your opponent.

</li><li> The German <em>Kaiserschlacht</em> offensive on the Western Front in 1918. The Russian Revolution closed down the Eastern Front, and the Germans concentrated the last of their elite troops for one more shot at beating the British and French before the US Army entered the fray. The British knew what was coming, and had it lampshaded even before it happened: "If Germany attacks and fails, she will be ruined." Germany attacked, failed, and was ruined.
<ul><li> They and their Austro-Hungarian allies also did the same a bit earlier on the Italian Front. Knowing that Italy's commander-in-chief Cadorna was a crappy battlefield commander, they launched a mad assault to try cutting through the demoralized and mismanaged Italian military and seize Venice (main naval base) and the area around Brescia (location of most of Italy's weapon factories). The resulting Battle of Caporetto did plow through a sizable part of the Italian military, but it discredited Cadorna and resulted in him being replaced with the more competent Armando Diaz and a slew of reforms and aid from the other Western Allies. Between this and Cadorna having heavily fortified the only way to Brescia, the offensive was stopped the well north of either targets and left the now broken and stretched out force to be wittled out for a year before Italy attacked back.
<ul><li> They tried it again in the Second Battle of the Piave River (the first being the one that stopped the Austro-Hungarian offensive after Caporetto), in which they tried to break through the Italian lines during the <em>Kaiserschlacht</em> (that had caused the redeployment of the French and British troops) to try and knock Italy out of the war, knowing that they were using their last reserves and they wouldn't be able to recover anymore. As the Italians knew it was coming (to the point they started shelling the Austro-Hungarians about half an hour before they were scheduled to start their own shelling), the offensive was brutally stopped, enough that the Austro-Hungarians was morally crushed.
</li></ul></li><li> Italy's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a> came at Vittorio Veneto. Succeed, and Austria-Hungary would be out of the war and open to passage to attack Germany from south. Fail, and the Italian army would be ruined, giving the Central Powers a last chance to reverse the course of the war. The attack succeeded to the point the Austro-Hungarian Empire could barely surrender unconditionally before collapsing and breaking up.
</li></ul></li><li> Predators who practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator">Cursorial Hunting</a>. Chasing prey into rough terrain or over too long a distance will result in prey too weak to fight or escape (if it doesn't simply drop of exhaustion) or a hunter too weak to find alternate prey if it escapes.
</li><li> A "Mic Drop" during a rap battle. Finishing your verse, then holding out the microphone and dropping it, as if to say "I just rocked so hard there's no way you can match me." It's a total badass move when timed correctly, <em>but</em> if your opponent picks the mic up and counters, not only does <em>he</em> look like the badass for meeting the challenge, you look like a showboating chump. Picking up the mic has its own perils: Try and keep going and come up short, you look doubly weak for not knowing when to quit.
</li><li> While not initially planned quite as such, the Battle of Stalingrad rapidly became this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a>. The city was named for Josef Stalin, as he had defended the city during the Russian Civil War, and was an important transport hub for supplies from America and Britain coming in through Persia. Taking the city would not only cut off the Soviet Union's vital Lend-Lease supply line, but allow Germany to reap the oil-rich Caucasus. As the fighting dragged on in the city, Hitler began to up the propaganda by saying that the city would be the site from where Germany sealed her final victory. Then, winter came, and the Sixth Army slowly starved, froze, and ran out of ammunition before they were forced to surrender. From there, the front lines steadily advanced towards the West, towards Berlin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RammingAlwaysWorks">Ramming</a>. Pick any fighting vehicle, it applies to all of them. On the one hand, you might have no other options left, and ramming can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>. On the other hand, you have to cross through point blank range of the enemy's guns, and even if you do manage a successful ram, there is a very real chance they will explode and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">take you with them</a>.
</li><li> The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike">Alpha Strike</a> as done by an aircraft carrier. The target is going to be <em>pasted</em>, but should an enemy come across the now-defenseless carrier, it's in deep trouble.
</li><li> The D-Day landings in Normandy. While war had already shifted against Germany, landing Western Allied troops in France was a carefully calculated move to help accelerate the collapse of the Wehrmacht and end the war in Europe. It was extremely risky, as the Allies were literally committing all the troops they had into the invasion. General Eisenhower even had a speech prepared in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">he assumed full responsibility in case the invasion failed</a>. Needless to say, the landing was a success and eleven months later, Germany surrendered. Several German commanders — both at the time and later — actually said the war could have been ended much faster than that, had the Allies pressed across the Rhine with the same speed and single punch as they did towards Paris.
