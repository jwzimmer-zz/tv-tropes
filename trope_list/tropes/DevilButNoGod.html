This Devil is a very real being with followers, worshippers and real power, who takes an active hand in making trouble for the world. But in an odd twist, a lot of stories leave out the Devil's good counterpart; either there is no benevolent God, or he's only talked about and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy">never actually does anything</a>. This is particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> if the series makes a big deal of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a>.
</p><p>It's worth noting that the Abrahamic religions (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Christianity">Christianity</a>) tend to forbid visual <em>depictions</em> of God (the argument being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotGraspTheTrueForm">it's impossible for a human to accurately depict an all-powerful, incomprehensible being beyond all space-time</a>, though most versions of the Bible explicitly say God created man in His image, meaning God would look like a human, if viewed literally, and Christians do traditionally believe he took the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">a man</a>), so this trope may exist out of respect to such traditions.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> wrote a novella called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScrewtapeLetters">The Screwtape Letters</a></em>, detailing the correspondence between a mortal human's literal "personal demon" and that demon's supervisor. In a commentary about the story, Professor Lewis wrote that he wanted to include similar letters between the demon's opposite number, but claimed that it was far too difficult to get into an angel's mindset to do so. The existence of this trope may well be partially explained by similar limits experienced by other authors.
</p><p>Another alternate explanation is that in most cases He knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">the heroes</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense">don't actually need His help</a>, so He doesn't give it. Another reason is that God might easily become the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> (in fact, the very name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> came from the habit of Greek and Roman plays to have one of the gods come down from the heavens to fix up the mess the others had created), so the writers need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExitMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExitMachina">get rid of him</a>. Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">people are significantly harder to make bad than good</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, which has the "God Hand", a group of five powerful demons as the closest thing to gods. The only other set of deities, the Four Elemental Kings, are said to be loving and protective of humanity, but only seem to help out if consciously summoned. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Idea of Evil</span>, who the Godhand answer to, seems to be the closest thing to a God in the <em>Berserk</em> universe, but it's only (so far) been seen in a semi-canon chapter that was cut for spoilering the plot . However, it's both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsEvil">AND the devil</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it stated it basically existed because humans want a supernatural explanation for why they live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>, nd obliges by making the world an even shittier place</span>). It, however is only God in the sense that it influences and controls people. It is not the creator of the universe itself and only seems to have a limited (if any) control over physical reality itself and it can only influence the physical through humanity (it can't summon storms or cause earthquakes).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>. Is there really anyone above the humans and the devils, except perhaps a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilOfAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilOfAngels">Council of Angels</a>? Aion's entire life can be seen as a quest to find an answer to that (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">Famous Last Words</a> don't exactly help</span>). That's the anime version. In the manga, the demons are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually aliens</span>, and Aion is fully aware of this (and subsequently believes that God and religion are just another cog in an "oppressive system") and the Apostles are stated to be "chosen by the Astraline", while God...well, not mentioned much. Either he's carefully manipulating things in the background, or just simply doesn't exist.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>, the only supernatural beings are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Shinigami</a>, who live by cutting the lives of humans short, and their world is a rather hellish place.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em> we have lawful evil devils, while shinigamis are either lawful neutral or chaotic evil, but there are no benevolent supernatural beings. In the anime version the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is a fallen angel and a mention of God, which implies there is good angels, but they never show up and a devil saves the day.
</li><li> The main characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em> are agents of Hell and their boss is a devil figure in the form of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a spider</span>.

<ul><li> The voice of God has been heard in certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>, usually talking to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a>, who works as its Agent of Vengeance.

<ul><li> DC has a God-surrogate called The Presence, and there are several other beings which are pretty God-like. For continuity purposes, these are sometimes explained as being various aspects of The Presence.

</li><li> The Logos (a group of godlike beings that make up a sort of harmonious pantheon, also usually involved with The Spectre)
</li><li> The Source (the universal creative force, mostly appears in works related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackKirby">Jack Kirby</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewGods">Fourth World</a> mythos)

</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">JLA</a> miniseries starring Zauriel the Angel climaxed with the rogue angel Asmodel storming the palace of God only to find it empty. Zauriel lectures Asmodel on the naivete of expecting God to be some mere corporeal form: God is <em>everywhere</em> and swiftly sends Asmodel to Hell.
</li><li> By contrast to this, various devils often show up in the DC Universe, most notably Neron, whose shtick is making Deal With The Devil type bargains with unwitting mortals. Demons seem to pop up far more often in the series then their heavenly counterparts, even though some (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Etrigan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Etrigan">Etrigan</a>) aren't all bad. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a> even had his own ongoing title under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VertigoComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VertigoComics">Vertigo</a> imprint.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, we're introduced to Lucifer Morningstar and several other powerful demons preside over Hell. While there are also angels and we're offered a glimpse of Heaven, God is only briefly mentioned in passing. There are many deities and spirits from various mythologies represented in the series, but the Abrahamic God never makes an appearance.
</li><li> The climax of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Lucifer">Lucifer</a></em>, a spinoff of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em> and therefore technically connected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, ultimately did show God and what happened to him: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he ditched his creation millennia ago because he was unimpressed with how humanity was turning out. Lucifer ultimately has to convince God not to scrap the whole thing altogether.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>, Satan was a recurring character in the Son of Satan series. God, Jesus or the Angels never appeared or interfered. Later, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> that Satan was being impersonated by demons such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mephisto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Mephisto">Mephisto</a>, and that the true Devil had NEVER appeared in a Marvel story <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0xuvs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0xuvs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0xuvs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It has since been revealed that there are several Netherrealms claiming to be Hell, and that its rulers <em>inspired</em> legends of the Devil rather than directly being him, and the only souls they lay claim to are those who made bargains with them.</span>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a>, angels and Heaven have shown up.

</li><li> The Marvel Universe with this is actually an inversion of the trope. As in there is quite clearly a supreme God (The One-Above-All) but no supreme Devil. About the One-Above-All there are two hypotheses floating around with an accompanying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Shrug of God</a> as both have their own implications the company doesn't want to tackle: 1) They are the Judeo-Christian God (which would lead to uncomfortable questions about the other gods) 2) They are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> (which would "demote" YHVH to just another godhead like Zeus or Odin). If you dig deep enough you can find canonical evidence for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">both</a></em>, but generally option 2 seems to be more popular (and would actually explain 1) too, when the author happens to be monotheistic his/her god will be the supreme one).
<ul><li> That being said, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalHulk">The Immortal Hulk</a></em> seems to have introduced a supreme Devil in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">the One-Below-All</a>, although its precise nature isnt entirely clear.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>:
<ul><li> A good example is when an old flame allows Bruce Banner to see all his inner personalities (each a different Hulk), one of whom takes the form of a monstrous reptilian devil. Devil Hulk tells Bruce "There's a little bit of God and the Devil in everyone", but the comics have yet to get around to that God part. We do get to see that an incarnation of the Beast lives in Bruce's head as well.
</li><li> Another Hulk story offers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a>: Old Greenskin (who at the time had Bruce Banner's intellect) acted as best man at Rick Jones' wedding, and Mephisto crashed the party, claiming to have a lien on the bride's soul. He offered the Hulk a deal: His soul for hers. Banner thought it over, looked up at the sky, and sucker-punched the demon so completely that he flew right through the fire-circle wards he'd set up to keep the other superbeings in attendance from interfering. Sputtering, Mephisto screamed that what the Hulk had done was impossible (No mortal, however powerful, should be able to land a blow on a conceptual being without permission). Banner replied, (not an exact quote): "Weren't you listening to what the preacher said? <em>We are gathered here in the sight of God!</em> What, did you, of all beings, think that those were just words?" While Mephisto leaves the wedding seemingly defeated, his thoughts reveal that he took the beating on purpose to increase the Hulk's hubris. A few issues later, the Hulk's organisation, the Pantheon, went down in flames and Banner suffered a pretty bad nervous breakdown, ruining all of his work with Doc Samson.

Either way, she's dead for the majority of the story. It is also briefly implied that the two beings are actually two aspects of the same being, who is both creator and destroyer, good and evil.

</li><li> In <em>Hellborn: Asylum of the Damned</em>, there is a Devil that plays an active part in damning the lives and souls of human beings, even the good ones. However, as stated by one of the characters in the film itself, "God doesn't take a look around here."
</li><li> While the <em>book</em> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> averts this trope (see below), this is the impression of someone who only watched <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">the movies</a> and never read any of the book or backstory. It's possible to watch the movies without ever learning that Gandalf is a maia (or even what a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">maia</a> is), or the existence of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilofAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CouncilofAngels">Valar</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Eru</a>, or know about the downfall or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">Númenor</a>. <em>Something</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InMysteriousWays">subtly</a> influences everyone's fate and sends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Gandalf back from the dead</a>, but it is sufficiently abstract and distant when compared to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Sauron</a> as to qualify for this trope.
<ul><li> Then again, Sauron is a being who has somehow seized control of armies of orcs and a mighty wizard before even getting an eye. By the end of the movie the most he has is a symbolic mouth, and that's only in the extended edition.
</li><li> However, Sauron isn't the Devil either. He's just Morgoth's most trusted lieutenant.
</li><li> In other words, he's <em>a</em> devil but not <em>the</em> devil (or you could say he's the <em>de facto</em> devil, since the genuine article's currently a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a>).

Apparently, the forces of Heaven are not concerned enough to show up and do something about it. There are some Catholic demonologists mentioned to fight the demons, but we never see this and the one who is shown in the film only gives the protagonist information on them.

The good guys have an afterlife called Dark Forest, and earlier in the series at least the appearance of having actual religion, although it is never discussed. This is pretty odd for a series whose title location is an <em>abbey,</em> populated by what was clearly, in the beginning, a monastic order. The not-quite-religion fades as the series continues. There is also the fact that in the original "Redwall" book, the giant adder is named Asmodeus, which one in-universe character identifies as "the name of the devil himself". In real world mythology, Asmodeus is depicted as various kinds of demon king, depending on which version one reads, but is certainly a very high-ranking lord of Hell.

Given Shadoath's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when she, being more grasping and power-hungry than truly evil, broke the Runes that held the True World together, the other Bright Ones magically wrote their sorrows on her until it broke her completely, hollowing out everything happy and positive in her</span>), and the stated nature of the True World, the Bright Ones are less God/Satan than heroic-scale exaggerations of human nature like you might see in ancient mythology. Because Shadoath is a Bright One and Fallion isn't (yet), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">her corrupt deeds are frequently much greater in scope and consequence than Fallion's heroic deeds</a>.

The widely-believed explanation at the beginning of the series is that God and the Devil made an agreement to avoid overt interference in the affairs of humanity, and only God kept his word. Later, a character speculates that God is just a lot more subtle than the Devil. The sixth book gives a definite answer: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">God has lost interest in the world, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGodsMustBeLazy">spends all his time sitting around admiring how awesome he is</a></span>. And in the seventh book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">God is essentially fired and His position is filled by someone who'll actually <em>do</em> good</span>.
</li><li> While the Creator exists, is good, and wants to help in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant">The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</a></em>, he exists outside of the universe of the Land and cannot interfere directly without causing the end of the world. Lord Foul, on the other hand is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">trapped inside the same universe</a> which is not a good thing for anyone sharing the place with him. However, Covenant's initial appearance in The Land appears to have been the Creator's doing; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">a plan to circumvent the whole causing the end of the world thing, that hinged on using free will</a> as a means to achieve something greater than could be achieved through either direct intervention or use of a tool of some sort. Just how well this has worked is somewhat up in the air, but the Gambit does appear to still be playing itself out.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s works and the resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Cthulhu Mythos</a>, there is neither a God or the Devil (although Nyarlatothep does fulfill the Devil's role in some ways), just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorrorStory">ancient godlike beings who don't give a damn about humanity and will kill us all when they return</a>. The closest thing to good deities (the Elder Gods), have no more love for humans than the others; they just want to keep the Great Old Ones imprisoned (and since that is a good thing for humanity, they can be considered "good" from our perspective).
<ul><li> Notably, the Elder Gods were an addition by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AugustDerleth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AugustDerleth">August Derleth</a>, who was an avid admirer of Lovecraft, as well as a devout Christian, and couldn't or didn't want to understand Lovecraft's intentions to depict the universe as a hostile and uncaring place where humanity has absolutely no special position, and instead made Earth the central battleground for cosmic incarnations of good and evil. Latter contributors to the Mythos often kept the Elder Gods, but made them less "good" than "uncaring but opposed to more dangerous things".
</li><li> Also, while Nyarlathotep gets continuously interpreted as the Devil by various humans, the implications that aren't dependent on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> seem to portray him as a Shiva-like destructive but impartial deity.
<ul><li> Although he <em>does</em> often appear to enjoy himself <em>immensely</em> when in human form...
</li><li> That's something of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> by later writers. In Lovecraft's own stories he has two appearances in human form, and one in near-human. In first of those he isn't yet really a deity, but simply a human scientist who has become essentially an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of the immutable cosmic laws (it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>), and is simply driven rather than malevolent or cruel, as far as the reader can tell. He receives human sacrifices in person as the Black Man, but he never speaks in that story and gives no impression of sadism for its own sake - it's just a function that he is performing. His depiction as a creatively cruel monster trickster is mostly based on his appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDreamQuestOfUnknownKadath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDreamQuestOfUnknownKadath">The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</a></em>, where he once again is performing a role as the protector of the Great Ones - though while clearly holding them in contempt. But even as he torments Carter with false hope, he seems to deem him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, facing him directly instead of just letting his masters squash him like a bug, as had happened to everyone else who tried to see Earth's gods.
</li><li> The physical universe does have a divine creator, in a certain sense of the word. It was created by Azatoth, who's sometimes irreverently referred to as the "Blind Idiot God", because he is little more than a mindless formless mass of chaos residing in the center of reality. He is also the progenitor of all the Outer Gods.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> While the <em>Otherness</em> in F. Paul Wilson's Adversary novels is a reasonable stand-in for the Devil (with a side order of Lovecraftian abomination), the opposing force that works against the Otherness is fundamentally indifferent to human welfare, and is definitely not God.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstLaw">The First Law</a>.</em> There are no true gods in the setting; in fact, the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalDragonJesus">Crystal Dragon Muhammad</a> being a powerful wizard running an elaborate ruse is a major part of the setting and its general tone. However, demons are very real. Oddly enough, the closest thing to a God figure is the mythic hero Euz, who was himself half-demonic. His four sons (well, Juvens, Kanedias, and Glustrod, anyway) went on to start the plot of the original trilogy in motion.

Tash is another supernatural creature, but is not directly depicted as Aslan's opposite. However, Aslan's "father", the Emperor-Beyond-The-Sea, never physically appears, but this fits with New Testament depictions of Jesus appearing physically while God the Father works behind the scenes.
</li><li> The <em>Paradis</em> books justify this—God lost to Satan, who turned everything into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> and sends all the dead to Hell.

<div class="indent"><strong>Gandalf</strong>: Bilbo was <em>meant</em> to find the Ring, and you also were <em>meant</em> to have it—and that is an encouraging thought.

Yet who the ground is holy to, with whom one would settle the imbalance, and what one does with a soul is never explained.
</li><li> <em>The Fall of Chronopolis</em> by Barrington J. Bayley. The adversary Hulmu is real and threatening, but the religion of the nameless The Church, insofar as it makes any sense, seems to be a weird version of pantheism.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FelixCastor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FelixCastor">Felix Castor</a></em> novels have several demons lurking on the periphery ever since the recent return of the restless dead, but there's no mention made of angels or God's representatives.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AshesToAshes2008">Ashes to Ashes (2008)</a></em>, the forces of evil are alive and well, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and walking around in the form of Jim Keats</span>, but even though <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Gene is the force behind Purgatory, he is never identified as "good", just the target of Keats's vengeance</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>: The Shadows are almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to the devil, but they don't really have a good counterpart. The Vorlons are the good equivalent as Kosh appears as the epitome of each race's archangel when he left his suit at that one time. The thing is Vorlons and Shadows try to play the Good/Evil axis, but are really templers of the Order/Chaos axis. In Season Four, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Vorlons aren't the good guys, they're almost as bad as the Shadows, and they only appear to be angels because they genetically and telepathically manipulated the younger races. When their true form is finally revealed, they're clearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">Starfish Aliens</a></span>. Even Lorien, the oldest and most powerful being in the galaxy, refers to the universe itself as the creator of life.
</li><li> The status of God in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Buffyverse">Buffyverse</a></em> is very suspect. The series has "The Powers That Be", supposedly forces that fight for good, but the show is vague on what exactly they are. They also seem to do little to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">the heroes</a>, sending visions that let them know when people are in trouble and have been implied to have directly helped them a few times, but they're often nowhere to be seen when the shit really hits the fan, and the few beings said to work for them are often uninterested and unsympathetic to the heroes' plights. They are even referred to by the heroes as "The Powers that Screw You" and "The Powers that Sit on Their Be-Hinds." On the evil side, the series has the Senior Partners, ascended demons who work through the interdimensional law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart, who are shown to be VERY active in spreading evil and contributing to humanity's eventual downfall. The show's background has the Earth previously ruled by demonic gods millenia ago and Buffy's last season saw the heroes fighting the personification of evil, neither of which seem to have a good equivalent. In addition, at one point in the series a vampire in the series asks Buffy if God exists, and she responds "Nothing solid".
<ul><li> This is all countered to an extent by the fact that Buffy was resurrected from a place of perfection and peace, that she is pretty sure was heaven. But whether the existence of an afterlife implies the existence of a god is another debate.
</li><li> Also, for all the demons in the series, there's not one angel. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At least until they start showing up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a> comics post-After The Fall, and most of them turn out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Though not all the demons are bad - several characters make references to the existence of peaceful demon races, and Whistler, Clem, Lorne and Doyle are all demons or half-demons who allied with the heroes at one time or another.
</li></ul></li><li> Still, the current evidence suggests that the most powerful terrestrial force for good in the Buffyverse is the Slayer. This is almost certainly true after the events of the <em>Buffy</em> finale.
</li><li> It's worth noticing that at least some Graeco-Roman and Egyptian deities exist in some form in the Buffyverse, with appeal to Hecate, Janus and Osiris resulting in, variously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">transformation into a rat</a>, everybody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheCostume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheCostume">transforming into their costumes</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">resurrection</a>. These may just be sufficiently advanced demons. Glory is also referred to as a God, though one of the evil ones.
</li><li> Crosses are symbolic of crucifixion and holy water is holy because it has been blessed by a priest; neither are magic or supernatural in and of themselves, yet they are harmful to vampires. This doesn't prove the existence of God, but there has to be some kind of unquantifiable force that imbues these objects with their powers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that Christians were simply the religion most dedicated to hunting vampires/demons and therefore used things harmful to demons as their holy symbols.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed (1998)</a></em>, the Devil ("the Source", short for "Source of All Evil") appears in several successive versions, but the show is maddeningly vague about who or what is in charge of "up there". The "Whitelighters" answer to "the Elders", but who do THEY answer to? Blank-out. The Elders seem to be the highest authority for the side of good, considering they were the ones who released the power of the Gods onto the mortals. Even so, they never actually do anything, except make things even more difficult for the main characters.

While the planet Fire does have a heavenly counterpart called Water, Water has no counterpart to Prince. By season 4, Fire and Water are gone, but Prince has reincarnated on Earth, where once again there are no real forces of good to stand in his way.

But the heroic elder beings tend to be light on the ground. This doesn't seem to worry the Rangers most years, who usually save the day without <em>needing</em> divine intervention, but during season 10, the Rangers <em>would</em> have died on multiple occasions had a god (Animus, the diety of the wild zords) not directly intervened to save them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reaper">Reaper</a></em>. The Devil is a main character and several demons have appeared, but neither God nor explicit angels have. Well, the demons are all fallen angels, one demon managed to get his old gig back, and God was mentioned as the ultimate winner by the Devil in the first episode. Still, a good deal less good than evil.
</li><li> With all the false gods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, there is no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Alien</a> masquerading as the God of Abrahamic religions — whereas the Goa'uld Sokar is said to have been the inspiration for the Devil in various cultures.
<ul><li> The ascended beings are sorta stand-ins for angelic beings: clad in white, all-knowing and infuriatingly self-satisfied. Occasionally one of them will get around their own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveCodeOfConduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveCodeOfConduct">Obstructive Code of Conduct</a> to pull off a genuine miracle, like when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Oma Desala fights Anubis to a standstill</span>, or when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Morgan La Fey heals Teal'c and kicks Adria's butt</span> in <em>The Ark of Truth</em>.
</li><li> The series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this at one point, with Teal'c commenting that he can't imagine a Goa'uld capable of the benevolence shown by Jesus Christ.
</li><li> The question of the Abrahamic God's possible existence (or at least the existence of an all-powerful creator deity) is brought up in the Stargate Universe spin-off series in several episodes such as "Faith" were the crew find a star system with a paradise planet that should not exist there due to it's age not matching it's state and the fact that the Ancient Seed Ships didn't detect it when passing through the location. It was revealed to be created by an extraordinarily advanced race of beings (who may or may not be Ascended Beings) between the time Seed Ships passed through and Destiny arrived which is give or take 2000 years. Some characters believe the aliens are a higher power or God or both and choose to stay with no proof one way or the other.
</li><li> Later, these same aliens seemingly save T.J.s baby from dying in the womb after a gunshot wound and sent it to the planet to live there via non-physical means however it may have been a dream induced by the Destiny's A.I. considering later on again the crew from the planet return without the baby having been resurrected after dying from the harsh winter there and sent back only to die again shortly after. One of them believes the aliens restored their bodies but not their souls and that T.J's baby is in a better place but these is neither confirmed nor denied.
</li><li> Finally it's revealed during the series that the Ancients discovered a signal or pattern or some form of intelligence embedded deep within the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation of the universe which existed prior to the universe's creation indicating the either the existence of an far older and more advanced Precursor race than the Ancients (possibly the aliens who built the star system) or God or even both. However the series was cancelled before it had a chance to resolve these storylines.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> has an interesting history with this.
<ul><li> Throughout the first three seasons, demons and other forces of evil were running rampant across the world without any opposing force of good to stop them aside from human hunters. The Devil gets a mention, but as a religious deity which the demons believe in, not as an actual character. There are also a number of pagan gods and demigods, but they all seem to be either evil or purely self-interested.
</li><li> In terms of the demons' good counterparts, in season 4 the writers decided to take a different direction and angels first appear, despite Dean's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">disbelief</a>. They are technically on the side of good, but vary in how much they care about helping people versus pursuing their own goals and interests. There are plenty of good angels, but they are bound by a strict hierarchy where disobedience is the highest crime. In 4.02 it's explained that the Devil/Lucifer the archangel will once again roam the earth unless the Apocalypse can be averted (being an archangel, his "good" counterpart is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelMichael">Archangel Michael</a>). His backstory is also fleshed out: After he was expelled from Heaven for refusing to bow down to man, he created the first demon and is responsible for most of the larger storyline across all 5 seasons. In the season 4 finale, the 66 seals keeping Lucifer trapped are broken, and he returns to Earth as the season 5 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> As for God himself, he has only ever been seen by four archangels. In the season 4 finale, Zachariah claimed God had 'left the building', and that the angels were giving the orders. In season 5 however God has been implied to have intervened in the storyline, transporting Sam and Dean out of harms way and bringing the angel Castiel back to life. Subsequent attempts to find him reveal that he is completely apathetic about the war between Heaven and Hell. Either that or while he does want Sam and Dean to win, he needs to be subtle in his methods to allow free will to continue. Then in the season 5 finale it's very strongly implied that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chuck is God. Admittedly, all he does is dress in an uncharacteristically smart white suit as opposed to his usual scruffy state, act in a much more calm and knowing manner, and then vanish into thin air, but since all angels and demons thus far had thought he was just a prophet and otherwise ordinary human, there aren't many alternatives. After all, angels and demons can detect each other. Plus, with his monologue/narration...he's God.</span>
</li><li> Season 11 confirms <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Chuck is indeed God and that he has simply been off doing his own thing throughout the entire series. In this setting, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsFlawed">God Is Flawed</a> as all hell. He admits that he used to have a great part in helping humanity move forward but stopped after a certain point due to a combination of both humanity and the angels disappointing him time after time and realizing that his interference wasn't effective. Eventually he decided that humanity was better off left to their own devices and left, which is why he didn't personally step in to stop the Apocalypse. While he feels that things have improved since his departure, others like Dean and many of the angels feel differently. During his conversations with Metatron, Dean, and even Lucifer, he's clearly frustrated that nothing he does or doesn't do seems to help his creations</span>.
</li><li> As of Season 12, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> God has left Earth alongside his sister Amara for parts unknown. Unfortunately for everyone else, Lucifer is still loose and the other archangels are either dead or indisposed, meaning that the show has finally truly crossed into this territory</span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that there originally weren't going to be angels and an Abrahamic God on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> at all, and that the decision to introduce them in season 4 was made after the 20072008 Writers Guild of America strike wrecked the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">planned ending</a> to season 3 and forced the creators to find a new way to get Dean out of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>. Whether Lucifer was also a result of this change or was intended to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> from the start is unclear (his existence was alluded to prior to the episodes affected by the strike, but only in extremely vague terms that could have just been intended as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldBuilding">World Building</a> before being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWelding">welded</a> into the main storyline).

The episode also reveals that much of the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> involves an attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusEstMachina">build a machine "God"</a> to oppose SKYNET.

Even the surviving gods of the non-chaos factions tend to be genocidal jerkasses, and the worst gods are the C'Tan, who are trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">exterminate every living thing in the universe</a> then eat their souls afterward (and one of them is possibly the god of an Imperial faction, though they don't know it). Based on information from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a>, there may be two surviving non-evil gods... one is implied to be a C'tan (and therefore is one of the omnicidal gods out to <em>eat</em> souls <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> though in fairness, it may be due to their trickster natures, so it would be unsurprising that the two are separate entities that <em>impersonate</em> each other</span>), and the other is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">tortured</a> by Nurgle (who is, incidentally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">one of the more likeable deities</a>).
<ul><li> It has been hinted that the Eldar are slowly bringing about the birth of a new god which may be able to destroy Chaos (although it has been suggested that the birth of this god would require the death of every last Eldar). As for humanity, every positive emotion which could lead to the creation of a benevolent Warp entity is focused squarely on the Emperor, whose dying physical body is hooked up to an enormous life support machine. It's implied that if the Emperor were ever allowed to die, he would ascend to true godhood and be able to fight Chaos directly. Unfortunately, the loss of the Emperor from the physical world would be an unsustainable disaster for the Imperium: his psychic strength controls the Astronomican, a massive navigational beacon made of psychic energy, without which Warp travel would be practically impossible.

There is no counterbalancing ultimate <em>good</em> god.
<ul><li> Tharizdun <em>may</em> be the most utterly evil of Greyhawk's god, but he is far from the strongest- in the first three editions of the game, he was ranked as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevels">intermediate deity</a>, and his imprisonment barred him from affecting the world more than a weak demigod.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Gary Gygax's Gord novels</a>, Tharizdun once freed is a nigh-omnipotent being who can easily force all the demon princes, archfiends, and other rulers of the Lower Planes to serve him.
</li></ul></li><li> The most powerful of the evil gods, Nerull the Reaper, does have a good counterpart in Pelor the Sun God. Also, the demons of the Abyss (Demogorgon, Orcus, etc...) are directly opposed by some guardinal dukes from Elysium.
</li><li> Early in the company's history, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TSR">TSR</a> did publish statistics for God, Jesus and Archangels, but later removed them from publication after heavy criticism. They have tons of other gods though, both evil and good.
</li><li> Most of the core D&amp;D settings were actually extremely focused on the issue of balancing out the various alignments. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> all played heavily around the idea of Good/Neutral/Evil deities and other-planar beings. However, it was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> that really took the cake, as it had the concept that real estate on the alignment-based Outer Planes could be moved around based on the nature of the residents. This served to explain why gods were often too busy to meddle more in affairs on the Prime Material Plane. It also explained cosmic conflicts like the Blood War, which was really all the fiends fighting each other to absorb each other's planes and thus create a single "Hell". More often than not, the powers of Good just egged them on because it kept the fiends occupied.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, celestial "monsters" (such as Devas, Planetars and Solars) were often vastly more powerful than most of their fiendish counterparts (Demons, Daemons, Devils, etc.). A single Planetar or a Solar could flatten multiple Pit Fiends or Balors. However, they were also less numerous, so it was generally assumed to balance out.
</li><li> Forgotten Realms seems to avert this by balancing extremely evil and powerful figures with equally powerful and good figures. Most any evil deity will have a good counter-part, as will most evil entities, such as aberrations, orcs, drow (Dark elves), and so on. The one all powerful being, Ao, is considered some form of neutral, or just above it all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> uses this in all sorts of weird ways. One of the main themes of the setting is that evil has an advantage, but mortal heroism can make up the difference. As a result, you get things like the fiendish Overlords, who were obscenely powerful forces of darkness and corruption, without counterbalancing forces of benevolence - but the Overlords are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> because mortal dragons worked with the couatl to bind them.

</div></li><li> Most of the religion in the <em>Devil May Cry</em> series revolves around worshiping demons, with Dante's father being a good demon messiah. Also, there are demons that appear to be angels. It seems as if in this universe, that instead of demons being fallen angels - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedDemon">angels are demons who fell up.</a>
</li><li> In a speech near the end of <em>4</em>, Nero makes an explicit reference to God, although it's anyone's guess if it's <em>God</em> God, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersThatBe">Powers That Be</a>.

The story tells us that at many points in Earth's history demons and angels went to war against each other, and Mundus' has a pathological hatred for angels as a result of this rivalry. Sparda's decision to mate with Eva (who is an angel in this universe) made Mundus angry enough to exhile Sparda to his eternal torment. Also, we're told that nephilim, a hybrid subspecies born of demons and angels, were so powerful that they endangered the supremacy of both sides — this being the one exception where demons and angels actually fought together against a common enemy. As for where God is in this picture is unclear, nor are we told why the angels seem okay with Mundus ruling over the Earth as an emperor in the shadows.
</li><li> God is mentioned in the DMC Anime off hand. Issac, a man who frequents Dante's favorite diner, discovers Dante is a demon after spying on him for weeks. After Dante shows Issac that he's not a bad guy by saving his life, Issac asks Dante what he is, before realizing that sounds rude and dehumanizing and asks Dante who he is. Dante snidely throws it up in the air, saying that Issac should ask God.

If you look at the extended backstory brought on by FFXII, the Ivalice gods are monstrous jerks of the highest caliber (really, the Greek gods would be proud) and the assuming the Espers are the Lucavi and don't just have the same names, they actually come across as sympathetic. It's more a case of bad God, good Devil here. Also, Altima/Ultima <strong>is not</strong> a Lucavi - she's a head Angel who used to be under the Gods' direct service, but more or less told them to go to hell after realizing just how badly they treated the Lucavi and took up their cause. Of course any sympathy the Espers have lose it all in FFT where they're perfectly willing to have humans murdered by the <em>tens of thousands</em> just to resurrect Ultima.

As a result it has left them much weaker than the Daedra ("not our ancestors") who made no sacrifices during creation. Preferring a much lighter touch when intervening on mortal affairs, many mortals question whether the Divines even exist. The Daedric Princes, while not universally evil (some are, in fact, quite benevolent, and all tend to hold up their end of a bargain), tend to be amoral, unpredictable, sadistic and, on occasion, prone to attempting world conquest. They are universally reviled as 'evil', and their worshipers are considered misguided at best, and dangerous lunatics at worst. They <em>are</em>, however, very much present in the world. They speak directly to their worshipers, sometimes even appearing in a physical form, and are perfectly willing to offer immediate, tangible rewards for those that choose to do their work.
<ul><li> While the trope is played straight in the eyes of many denizens of Tamriel, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">protagonist</a> of each game tends to have the support the Divines in order to accomplish what they seek to do. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em>'s <em>Knights Of the Nine</em> expansion and the main quest of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> best exemplify this.

You are the only one to directly benefit from divine interventions in game, apart from a major intervention in a spoiler below. In <em>Skyrim</em>, very early in the main quest, the PC is revealed to be a "Dragonborn", a rare mortal gifted with the soul of an immortal (Aedric) dragon by the draconic God of Time, Akatosh.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Dunmer (Dark Elves)</a> have an interesting take on this. In general, they acknowledge that the Daedric Princes that they do revere - Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala - are actually ruthless, vicious and brutal entities; even Azura, the most benevolent of those Princes, still cursed the whole species for the actions of the Tribunal. At the same time, the Dunmer view everyone else, Aedra and Daedra alike, as either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterGod">lying tricksters</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsInept" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsInept">ineffectually weak</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">uselessly malicious</a>. (By comparison, Boethiah and Mephala are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">usefully</a></em> malicious, as they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp">taught the Dunmer how to survive in a harsh environment through their maliciousness</a>.) It's not really surprising that the only gods the Dunmer truly revered as benevolent were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">ALMSIVI</a>, or the Tribunal, a trio of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> who were a major part of Dunmer culture from the mid-1st Era to end of the 3rd Era 4000 years later. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All of whom are depowered and two of whom die as a result of the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em></span>.
</li><li> This is mentioned by the <em>Oblivion</em> NPC Else God Hater, a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daedra Lord worshiper</span>. "The gods don't do a damn thing. Do they even exist? How could anyone tell? Daedra Lords, sure. They exist. They do things. Bad things, mostly, but things you can see. The gods? They don't do a damn thing. So why do we build big chapels and sit around and mumble, and ask them to save us from this and that? It's stupid. And chapels and priests and folks groveling on their knees, they're stupid, too."
</li><li> The court mage in <em>Oblivion</em>'s Cheydinhal castle asks if you worship the Nine Divines, asking rhetorically if they've ever helped or harmed the PC. She states that were the hero to worship a daedra lord, they would get results. Bad ones, but measurable results. She then states that she considers worshiping gods a waste of time, though the daedra cult of Azura are a nice, reasonable bunch.
</li></ul></li><li> Clouding these waters further is the presence of Lorkhan (aka Shor, Shezarr, etc,) the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">"dead" creator god</a> of the mortal realm. According to virtually every creation myth (with a few variations,) he convinced/tricked the other divine pre-creation spirits into sacrificing part of their power to create the world. He was "killed" as a result, his "divine center" (heart) torn from his body and cast down in the world he helped to create. The moons are said to be his "rotting corpse" and his spirit is forced to wander Nirn, occasionally taking form as a "Shezarrine," great champions of mankind who usually show up to help in wars against the Elven races. So it's possible that rather than there being "Devils But No God," it could really be "Devils, weakened Angels, and a Dead God."
</li></ul></li><li> There <em>was</em> a God in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TearsToTiara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TearsToTiara">Tears to Tiara</a></em>. But not anymore, and the only people who ever met the guy have no idea where he's been for the rest of existence. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's actually a bit of an inversion, however. There is no God, but the Satanic figure is his former underlings the Twelve Angels.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em>, civilizations worship various gods, with temples being built in their honor and, very rarely, holy wars in their name.

Gods they very clearly ain't.
</li><li> While it's unsure if the Maker in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> exists, there is no Devil or god of evil, only personifications of character traits. A rage demon the PC fights with the help of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">templar</a> laughs at the templar's declarations of faith, taunting him that the god he worships and the heaven he hopes for simply don't exist, but that there are demons. He then attacks the party. (There is never any solid indication that the god the Templars worship really exists. Their church was started by a prophet who was said to have divine powers, but there is a competing theory that she was simply an incredibly powerful mage.)
<ul><li> It has likewise been speculated that the Maker could be an unusually powerful benign Fade spirit (they exist, but since they don't try to possess people by force, they are rarely seen, unlike demons) - or a Pride Demon.
</li><li> Regardless of whether or not God (the Maker) exists, the religion's particular belief is that the Maker turned his back on humanity, first for daring to try to reach his city deep within the Fade (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">which turned the Golden City into the Black City</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">unleashed the Archdemons and the Darkspawn</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gotterdammerung" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gotterdammerung">and caused the collapse of the powerful Tevinter Empire</a>), and then for subsequently murdering his bride (the prophet Andraste, who had <em>just</em> convinced the Maker that people were worth saving when she was <em>burned at the stake</em>). Suffice to say, if there <em>is</em> a God, humans really went out of their way to piss him off. The church believes that spreading the Chant and defeating the Archdemons will allow humans to redeem themselves in the Maker's eyes.
</li><li> The dwarves and the elves don't necessarily believe in the Chantry's teachings, preferring to believe in ancestors (Paragons) and the old gods (mostly of nature), for dwarves and elves respectively. While Paragons really did exist, there's no evidence for the Elven Pantheon until <em>Inquisition</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where Flemeth reveals herself to have a fragment of Mythal within her, and Solas turns out to be Fan'Heral/the Dread Wolf</span>. The <em>Trespasser</em> expansion pack reveals further information about them confirming that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were not really gods, but phenomenally powerful mages that became revered as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">god emperors</a> by their subjects</span>.
</li><li> According to Justice in the <em>Awakening</em> expansion pack even the spirits don't know if the Maker exists. As for the Devil there are no clear analogues except maybe the four demons that, according to the in-game codex, taught Humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a>. On the other hand you can fight several of them in the games as optional bosses, so it's unlikely that they are some kind of Devil.
</li><li> This is a key plot point in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. Corypheus (one of the 7 original Darkspawn) confirms the Chantry's version of the Darkspawn origin story, but states that the Golden City was already corrupted and empty when the 7 first entered it, and that there was no sign of the Maker inside. This fuels his plan to become God and give the world the Maker it deserves.
</li><li> The creators themselves have said that it is intentionally ambiguous and they don't plan to give a clear answer.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> series games and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">anime</a> where there is a counterpart for God called Arceus, but there is no counterpart for the Devil.

There is one who carries a striking resemblance to good'ol Lucifer in it's backstory. Giratina was one of the first Pokémon Arceus created, along with Dialga and Palkia. While Dialga was given domain over time and Palkia over space, Giratina control matter and antimatter. However, while Dialga and Palkia were nice enough, Giratina had some bad behaviour, which led Arceus to exiling it to the Distortion Realm, the world opposite of ours. Giratina is the only living thing there, and has complete control over that realm.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaceTheDarkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaceTheDarkAge">Mace: The Dark Age</a></em>, its stated that God has pretty much abandoned Earth because of the Covenant of the Seven's actions who made a deal with the demon Asmodeus to engulf the world in a perpetual dark age. It doesn't help that neither Christianity or Islam exist in this world and both Europe and the Middle-East are highly fragmented between pagan warlords while the world is going to crap.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FearEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FearEffect">Fear Effect</a></em>: The games make it clear that there is a Chinese version of hell and a Chinese version of the Devil called The King Of Hell. However, there seems to be no heaven or God - unless the island where the Eight Immortals (who don't seem to do much of anything) live at counts.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> universe which does feature benevolent gods, including some who directly help the player at times. Interestingly, the game's most widespread "good" religion, The Light, is arguably more like Buddhism in that it has nothing to do with worship or deities and more to do with philosophy and introspection.
<ul><li> That said, we have recently became aware of the Void Lords who created the Old Gods and are currently implied to be the ultimate force for evil in the universe/franchise.

</li></ul></li><li> Explicitly pointed out in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon">Fallen London</a></em>. When London was dragged a mile belowground it came into proximity with Hell, which exports Nevercold Brass in exchange for souls. There's no word on Satan, but there are devils aplenty, charming their way amongst society. Parts of the Church want to go to war against Hell - they did it once before and were crushed, but the devils were amused. They might not be amused again, but some of the clergy wonder.
<div class="indent"> "The thing is, we know the devils. But when did you ever see one of the Host? Their absence is nothing less than an embarrassment. Perhaps if devils go to war, then the Gate will open. Perhaps we can return to that blessed place. Perhaps we shall <em>partake.</em>"
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Thief">Thief</a></em> series, the Trickster, the Pagan god, is very much real and plays an active part in the goings on of the physical world, while there is never any indication that his opposite number, the Builder (sort of a more technology-inclined version of the Christian idea of God), is anything more than a religious construct.
</li><li> Not technically God and Satan, but almost every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> game has the main characters fight a very proactive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of a negative aspect of humanity (humanity's greed, humanity's desire to self harm, humanity's grief, humanity's dissatisfaction, humanity's apathy).

On the other hand, while various God characters show up (many of which are almost pathetically weak), none of them are stated to be an "absolutely good" God. The one God stated to have this role, The Great Dragon, has never been seen and nobody knows what it looks like beyond "it's supposedly a dragon" and there is no confirmation that it even exists. Even main character Reimu Hakurei, who is supposed to be its High Priestess, has no connection to it and in fact for a long didn't even know what deity the Hakurei shrine is supposed to house and hence who she is supposed to serve.

</li><li> Satan has appeared a few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em>, but God has never been seen outside of a dream Kiki had (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">where he peed on her head</a>). Averted during the "That Which Redeems" arc, however, where there <em>is</em> a Goddess of Good to balance out the Demon King. She's just been stuck in a freezer for a millenia or two.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CollegeRoomiesFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CollegeRoomiesFromHell">College Roomies from Hell!!!</a></em>, Satan <em>certainly</em> exists, being a major recurring antagonist. However, the only clear evidence that God exists is a few "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">miraculous</a>" events and Satan's own word; at least at one point, Margaret, the character Satan's most antagonized, was openly skeptical.
</li><li> In the present timeline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HolyBibble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HolyBibble">Holy Bibble</a></em>, Satan is very real and involved in the lives of mortals and angels alike, while God has only shown up once, and under dubious circumstances.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Mortasheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/Mortasheen">Mortasheen</a></em>, as it usually does, does this in a weird way. There are no gods (unless you count <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">The Ultimates</a>), mainly because the creator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">who said it himself</a> is an "agnostic science nut". However, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">the equivalents to demons</a> The Devilbirds, birds charged in the egg with negative psychic energy to cause and feed off of negative emotions. But, there are no angel equivalents.

<ul><li> Possibly inverted with the existence of <a class="urllink" href="https://bogleech.com/mortasheen/abathrael.htm">Abathrael<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a vaguely angelic entity that's treated as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Unknown</a> type, follows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a>, holds a decapitated human body inside itself, and seems to speak and behave like a computer program. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">It's not a traditional angel by any means</a>, but the mystery surrounding it leaves it possible that it may be a genuine divine entity, by contrast, the Devilbirds are just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psychic</a> bioweapons named and themed after various sins.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A very odd example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendOfTheThreeCaballeros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendOfTheThreeCaballeros">Legend of the Three Caballeros</a></em>. Donald Satan rules the Underworld, and while there are many benevolent or neutral deities around (such as the Roman gods, Xandra the goddess of adventure, Charon, the Sun and the Aztec incarnations of Life and Death) there is no judaeo-christian counterpart opposing him nor is there an alternate afterlife. Then again, the Underworld <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">is actually pretty livable</a> (murderous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> aside), so this "Satan" is ironically more like Hades, making it a reverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyHatesHades">Everybody Hates Hades</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> has a robot version of this. The robots make many references to Robot Hell (the Robot Devil is even a recurring character), whereas Robot Heaven only gets one sentence, and afterward is never mentioned again.
<ul><li> Robot Jesus is also mentioned. Jewish Robots believe that he existed and that he was a very well-made robot, but he wasn't their Messiah.
<ul><li> However, Bender interacted with a semi-corporeal space entity, which is strongly implied to be God - or, as Bender guesses and God seems to confirm, the result of God colliding with a space probe to become a kind of cyborg God. Its cameo in Bender's Big Score seems to suggest that some of its powers can be accessed without its awareness or consent by technological means, perhaps through its "space probe" half. This very entity directly TOLD Bender that it thinks that the best way to help people is to help them in a way that ensures they don't notice it. And given the strange prevalence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidences</a> working out in the heroes' favor
</li></ul></li><li> The Second Coming of Christ apparently happened in 2443, although its only lasting effect seem to have been the destruction of most of the world's video tapes and that people now prefix the name Jesus with the word "Zombie".
</li><li> Bender did, in fact, visit Robot Heaven in a recent episode and met Robot God (and told him to shut up). He only visits briefly as a Robot Ghost, so it's not clear if It's a physical or metaphysical place. Robot Hell, on the other hand, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">in New Jersey.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Trigon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> is built up as the series' parallel to Satan in almost every way, but there doesn't seem to be a contrasting "God" figure at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TransformersGeneration1">Transformers: Generation 1</a></em>, cartoon continuity. While both the cartoon and the comics had devil-figure Unicron, God-figure Primus was a comics-only figure until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> ten years later.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> as well. Character designer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/OneOfUs">and fellow fan</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Derrick Wyatt</a> has stated many times that Primus is not in the <em>Animated</em> universe, but Unicron might exist, albeit simply as a mechanical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> rather than an actual god. In the end, we saw neither.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a>,</em> we met Unicron in a three-parter. Primus gets the odd name-drop, and "By the Allspark" remains a popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhMyGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhMyGods">Oh My Gods!</a> statement (no word on whether they mean a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">big</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">box</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLifestream">where</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">sparks</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersCybertron">end up</a>.) but both concepts stay far offscreen.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> movie <em>Predacons Rising</em> finally clarifies the status of the Allspark in this series by blending <em>everything</em> ever meant by the word Allspark into one. Primus exists but we also don't meet him. Vector Sigma exists, and was used to restore the Matrix of Leadership in season two. Still, the Allspark is mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">something Optimus has to get back to the core of Cybertron</a>, while Unicron is alive, active, and trying to destroy all life and bring about a reign of chaos. (But as stated before, God showing up to save everyone is sort of a drama killer, so it's best if Primus keeps his hands out of things.)
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> God makes only a few appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> while Satan certainly has far more. In fact, everyone who isn't Mormon goes to hell. This was changed in "Best Friends Forever" where the angels admitted that they needed to have non-mormons in heaven due to a general shortage of people to fight the devil. God and Satan are on rather good speaking terms, and, despite all the fire and brimstone, hell is actually a pretty civil place. God and heaven aren't at all absent, they're just not as interesting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>: The Devil appears in one episode but God is never seen, and Rick C-137 (the smartest man in the multiverse) thinks he doesn't exist. It is certainly possible that God may indeed exist as well and Rick is aware of the fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">but chooses to deny its existence or defy its authority for whatever reason.</a> It is also possible that "The Devil" is not actually the biblical/literal devil, but rather yet another interdimensional being who is just a mere annoyance to Rick.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CelebrityDeathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a></em>: Satan and demons canonically exist, as do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">just about every supernatural creature imaginable</a>, yet throughout the series God only ever appeared in a story Nick made up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>, there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">very powerful (and god-like) demon</a> named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Aku</a>, who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">conquered</a> not just the world, but the whole <em>galaxy</em> as well.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRealGhostbusters">The Real Ghostbusters</a></em>, the heroes have visited quite a few hellish dimensions and fought demons from them, but if a heavenly version of the afterlife exists, it has never been seen.
