</p><p>Good guys tend to scar in an attractive, fashionable manner — usually a single neat pale line, flush with the skin and placed in one of the following strategic locations: straight across one cheek, straight down from beneath the eye (popular with tough and/or grizzled characters), or straight up from the eyebrow. A scar extending up or down from the lip can happen, but it's rare as it can give a harelipped look more associated with shifty characters (and a similar scar on the other side of the lip <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowGrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowGrin">is right out</a>). A scar straight over the bridge of the nose has the interesting effect of looking cute and warlike at the same time. They can also have a big, raised scar or a burn, but only if it's in a place where the character has to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shirtlessscene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shirtlessscene">shirtless</a> for you to see it. Perhaps the ultimately cliché "good guy" scar is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMarksTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMarksTheHero">two scars forming an X across the cheek or forehead</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Bad guys can also have fashionable scars to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakeover">show off their being evil</a>, which blurs the playing field a bit; more often than not they have big raised slashes (often running up the face, stopping just below the eye, then continuing from the eyebrow up) and mottled, discolored burns. They are not limited to one but may have two or three scars, or be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredWithScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredWithScars">Covered with Scars</a>; they may have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Red Right Hand</a> in the form of a missing eye or ear, missing teeth, or a large chunk out of the nose or chin. Anything they're missing might have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Artificial Limb</a> as a substitute, and in fact they might be so horribly scarred that they generally wear a mask over everything.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> can go either way. Anti heroes sometimes tend to have a scar starting from below the eye and ending above it while the eye itself is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAreUnbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAreUnbreakable">usually intact</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope can be easily averted or subverted however, given that a disfiguring scar can be used to show that they've had a hard or even tragic life, or to mark an influential moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryScarHasAStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryScarHasAStory">in their past</a>.
</p><p>Doesn't do well for the 'external beauty is meaningless' school of thought; it's more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">Beauty = Goodness</a> with respect to the relative sexiness/scariness of scars.
</p><p>If the scarred person has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> (and the work is sufficiently idealistic) expect said Love Interest to talk at least once about how they don't care about their loved one's scars.

<ul><li> Juumonji, one of a trio of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquents">delinquents</a> turned American football linemen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em>, has a cross-shaped scar on his face. His father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoryRepeats">has a similar scar</a>. Mamoru Banba also got several facial scars after his mysterious summer training.
</li><li> Zaraki Kenpachi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> has a scar straight down the left side of his face, going from his hairline down to his jaw. Hisagi Shuuhei has three vertical parallel scars on one side of his face (from a Hollow attack fifty years before), apart from a tattooed horizontal line across nose and cheeks and a number 69.
<ul><li> One character who has scars purely for the cool factor is Tsubaki, one of Orihime's Shun Shun Rikka. He springs into existence with a cool-looking facial scar down the side of his face, despite never having fought before.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">Old Soldier</a> Yamamoto is also covered in scars, which is expected considering that he has been alive and in battle for thousands of years. While he isn't evil, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">he isn't exactly what you would call good either</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> Mayuri Kurotsuchi is shown to have what appear to be surgical scars criss-crossing his entire body in the brief scene he is shown without his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakeover">creepy make-up</a> on.
</li><li> Nel has a scar on her forehead from when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nnoitra broke her mask and kicked her out of Las Noches</span>.
</li><li> Kenpachi also has two more scars on his chest, courtesy of Nnoitra.
</li><li> Grimmjow has one on his chest after he got hit with Ichigo's Getsuga Tenshou in their first fight.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>, several characters in the series have scars, and only the good ones at that since their enemies are demonic beings with regenerative abilities as one of their core powers; the hatred fueled slayer, Sanemi Shinazugawa, has a freaky collection of them, making him look somewhat evil, but those are there to show how committed he is in eradicating the actually evil beings destroying human lives; the most positive example is the protagonist himself, Tanjiro Kamado gets some scars along the way, on the chest, neck, and arms, in places where his beauty is not compromised, preserving his sweet nature and appearance. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The greatest demon, Muzan Kibutsuji, is later shown to have several scars he got in a legendary battle before, that could not be healed, just concealed, being the actual evil scars example in the series</span>.
</li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, Negi Springfield, received a small horizontal scar on his cheek during his fight with Setsuna during the Mahora Martial Arts Tournament.
<ul><li> He also received a scar <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fighting a recreation of his father in the final match of the tournament</span>. He could have had it magically healed, but he decided to keep the scar for sentimental reasons.
</li><li> Jack Rakan has a scar on each arm. We find out in a flashback that he got these <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when the Lifemaker attacked Ala Rubra and cut his arms off</span>. Obviously, they have since been reattached. Negi may also have a similar scar after his fight with Kagetarou.
</li><li> Ako has a large scar on her back of the more "evil" variety of scars, even though she's anything but. It's a large part of her character background that she is ashamed by it, has a phobia of blood from the accident when she received it, and freaks out when Negi sees it.
</li></ul></li><li> Giroro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> has a long straight scar diagonally over his left eye. His eye is perfectly fine though.
</li><li> Vash (good guy) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Trigun">Trigun</a></em> is horribly, unbelievably scarred, <em>and</em> has a missing arm, but his shirt (and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Artificial Limb</a>) covers it up.
<ul><li> His body is so heavily damaged that some parts of it are <em>riveted together with pieces of metal</em>. Figure that out.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not so disturbing once it's revealed that he's closer to a plant than a human.</span>
</li><li> Yeah. Because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that means that he's keeping them <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShouldHaveBeenBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShouldHaveBeenBetter">voluntarily</a></em>. That's a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">lot</a></em> less disturbing</span>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Balgus (good guy) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne">The Vision of Escaflowne</a></em> has numerous scars, including one dominating the left side of his face.
<ul><li> In the same series, getting a scar on his face from Van causes Dilandau (bad guy) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">to go crazy(er)</a>. And it was very neat, good-guy looking scar, by the way.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreatMazinger">Great Mazinger</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">Kenzo Kabuto</a> has a scar runs along of the left side of his head, stopping right above his eyebrow. It is not elegant or unnoticeable, even though he is one of the good guys.
</li><li> Himura Kenshin, the hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, has a single X-shaped scar on one cheek (hence the alternate title for some North American versions of the show, <em>Samurai X</em>). By contrast, one of the series' chief antagonists, Makoto Shishio, is so heavily scarred that his body is kept wrapped and bandaged at all times, save for his eyes and mouth.
<ul><li> Specifically, Shishio is burned, not mechanically scarred.
</li></ul></li><li> Naraku (bad guy) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> has a large spider-shaped scar on his back. This dates back to his days as a human (despite Naraku technically being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>...) and extends to all his "incarnations", parts of his body given will and intelligence. (This includes Kagura, one of the incarnations. Though Kagura herself evolves more into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> than a proper villain, she is still forced to reluctantly serve Naraku out of self-preservation).
</li><li> Luffy (good guy) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> has a small scar under his eye; the manga originally began with him cutting his face to prove himself to be a man, but this was cut out of the anime. His <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">grandfather (good guy but reluctant villain) has a similar scar over his eye</span>. Also, Coby, another good guy, received an X-shaped scar. X-shaped scars tend to pop out in the series, possibly as a tribute to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, on which Eiichiro Oda (the author) worked as an assistant.
<ul><li> Roronoa Zoro possesses a huge scar across his chest from his first bout with Mihawk (which he tried to poorly patch up by himself at first). Later on, he gains scars on his ankles from his attempt to cut his feet off to escape a villain's trap.
</li><li> Curiously, one of the major villains in the Enies Lobby arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rob Lucci, has a scar on his back in the shape of the World Government's flag. It's usually hidden by his shirt, though. Lucci is an interesting case-he has a Good Guy-type scar, and is a legally licensed agent of the <em>One Piece</em> world's governing body, but he is portrayed as a murderous sort who greatly enjoys the killing and spying that he does in his role as a government agent</span>.

<ul><li> On the other hand, Ed has artificial limbs, which are listed above as evil, and Al not only has, but is a giant suit of armor.
<ul><li> Ed has another scar on his forehead, gained from a small injury early on in the story. It's usually covered by his hair and it's only purpose is to leak blood comically whenever he gets whacked. It eventually heals over time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that it took so long to heal because Ed kept getting hit there.

</li><li> Gene Starwind of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> is another example of a good guy with evil scars. Including two rather jagged ones running across his cheek and countless others on the rest of his body. Unlike most heroic body scars, his shirt <em>doesn't</em> cover all of them. It might if he has <em>sleeves</em>, but...
</li><li> Yamcha (good guy) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a> Z</em> has 2 scars on his face. One over his eye and an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMarksTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMarksTheHero">X</a>" on his cheek. He didn't have them during the earlier sagas, though; they were gained sometime between Goku's defeat of King Piccolo and the start of the 23rd World's Martial Arts Tournament, and it's never explained how he got them.
<ul><li> Future Gohan has similar scarring on his face and looks a lot like Yamcha.
</li><li> We actually see Tenshinhan (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">former bad guy</a>) get his scar (a large cut mark from his upper right torso to his lower left) at the hands of his former idol, Murderer/Mercenary Tao.
</li><li> Although rarely seen, Vegeta's body is covered with scars. We get a good look at them during the Frieza saga while he is changing into his uniform, with his most recent scar up to that point being Yajirobe's sword slash to his back.
</li><li> Goku's father <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Bardock</a> has a large x-shaped scar on his cheek.

It is the result of an injury to his eye that led to an eye transplant. Umino Iruka has the horizontal scar through the nose, and a large chunk of the adult population of Leaf Village has some scar or other, generally quite unobtrusive. Morino Ibiki, on the other hand, was very badly scarred in the past during an interrogation, but he is still one of the good guys (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">well</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">mostly</a>), though he does cover the worst ones up with his bandana.
</li><li> Cho Hakkai in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a></em> has a scar on his belly.

<ul><li> In a later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> arc we see that Sanzo's body's been covered in scars since his teenage years. Thankfully they're all below his neckline and covered up by his abundant robes, so his handsome face can resume charming fangirls like before.
</li><li> Gojyo has two small scars under one of his eyes, from when his stepmother tried to kill him. His hair is usually long enough to hide them if he tilts his head a certain way, but he doesn't always.
</li></ul></li><li> Tsume in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> has a large cross-shaped scar on his chest, which is seen in both his true wolf form and his human disguise. The younger wolf Toboe says it looks cool, but it is not until near the end of the series (in episode 29, one of the OVA bonus episodes) that we learn the reason he carries it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Toboe dies, Tsume spends some time alone with his friend's body, and confesses to it (and the audience) that the other wolves of his pack scarred him for cowardice when he tried to run away instead of saving his companions from hunters.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sensui's scars are multiple, as you'd expect of a villain; however, they are entirely covered by his shirt, as you'd expect of a good guy (because he <em>used</em> to be one). Itsuki becomes scarred over his eye from taking Kuwabara's Rei-ken: a simple heroic scar. Mukuro's scars are also "bad guy" scars that cover half of her body; however, seeing as how she got them (by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">pouring acid over herself to prevent her "father" from raping her as a child</a>), as well as her usual hiding of them, makes them "good guy" markings</span>. Kurama temporarily gets a heroic X on his cheek as well (giving him a strong resemblance to Kenshin).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a></em> Dr. Kuroo Hazama aka Black Jack is a good guy who sometimes poses as a bad guy to keep his reputation... and is <em>massively</em> scarred all over his body and face, to the point his skin has some different colored spots. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He actually got these scars as a child, when a bomb exploded and almost killed him and his mother; he decided to become a doctor after finishing his rehab.</span>
</li><li> Kakihara in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IchiTheKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IchiTheKiller">Ichi the Killer</a></em>. He has a horizontal scar running across his cheeks and nose, a horizontal scar across his forehead, and a vertical scar that connects both over his left eye. In addition to a glasgow smile held together by piercings at the edge of his lips. He is arguably the villain even though the good guy isn't any better than him and Kakihara gets more screen time (about 75% of the manga and film).
</li><li> Kenshiro of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em> has seven scars that form the shape of the Big Dipper, which were given to him by his rival Shin. The villain Jagi was so badly scarred by Ken that he wears a helmet to conceal it (and to help keep his head from exploding); he also gave himself matching scars on his chest to masquerade as Kenshiro.
</li><li> Balalaika, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>'s resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>, has a huge scar down the right side of her face (and body) from having survived a point-blank frag grenade in the Afghanistan war. The scar has given her the derisive nickname "Fry-face" amongst the Roanapur gangster community, which is only spoken in her presence by people with a death wish. Although a villain by anyone's standard, she never actively antagonizes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">villain protagonists</a> and indeed hires them on several occasions.
<ul><li> Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>, Boris, has what looks like a knife scar across his nose.

How <em>that</em> works is fodder for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a>.
<ul><li> Gatomon's paw gloves conceal "X"-shaped scars from when Myotismon disciplined her. Similar to the MachGaogamon example, these scars are not visible in her other forms. Gatomon was introduced as one of Myotismon's flunkies, only to perform a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> when she is revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">the eighth DigiDestined's partner</a>.
<ul><li> Theoretically, she could still have these scars in her other forms; we've just never seen them. Angewomon has gloves that automatically cover almost all of her arms, Nefertimon has gauntlet-like armor on <em>her</em> arms, and we never canonically see her Mega forms. There is also Silphymon, but that's actually a combination of her and another Digimon so that could be the reason.
</li></ul></li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion">Leomon</a> as well as his evolved form <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Panjyamon</a>, are covered in scars, although they look less like scars and more like slightly darker patches of skin/fur.
</li></ul></li><li> Jet Black from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> has a large vertical scar running overtop his right eye. Typical good guy scar, and Jet is one of the nicest people in the series.
</li><li> Good guy Mugen receives a scar (well, three parallel ones) on his cheek from an enemy with knuckle claws in the three-part finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em>.
<ul><li> Bad guy Umanosuke, leader of the three brothers antagonizing Mugen, however, has a lidless left eye, apparently the inadvertent result of his encounter with Mugen. When his eyepatch comes off, revealing it, he becomes even more unbalanced than before.

After his eyesight is mostly recovered, he has to wear sunglasses to cope with the damage.</span>
<ul><li> Also in Part 3, Avdol has apparent scars beneath his eyes, that have a sinuous pattern. He also gets a scar on his forehead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">from his "death" at the hands of Hol Horse.</span>
</li><li> In Part 4, Okuyasu has an X-scar on his face, reminiscent of being attacked by Crazy Diamond, but while he is strong and can erase things with a swing of his right hand, he also is rather... lacking in the thinking department.
</li><li> Resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> DIO has a noticeable scar all across his neck, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that is the product of his head being attached to Jonathan Joestar's body.</span> As the scar heals, his powers grow stronger.
</li><li> From Parts 1 and 2, Speedwagon has a scar that goes from beneath his left eye and across his cheek, mirroring his backstory as a thug. Though, it's ultimately a good scar, since he's a kind-hearted man who's devoted to help the Joestar family.
</li><li> And, in Part 7, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil">President</a> Valentine has scars on his back that come from past torture; they resemble the American flag. Probably the main reason for him being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a> despite being an evil lunatic who (among many other things) forced himself onto a 14 year-old girl.

<ul><li> Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the first season, Gauron, has a deep gash of a scar down one side of his face.

Also, Wei's power is a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodyMurder">Bloody Murder</a> and so his arms are covered with scars from his constant cutting of himself, although those scars are usually hidden under clothing.
<ul><li> Amagiri, a morally ambiguous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> generally kept one eye <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyesAlwaysShut">shut</a>, suggesting some kind of injury there (although he did open it occasionally), and at the end of the first season, was seemingly killed in a fire. When he reappears in the interquels, he wears a large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyepatchOfPower">patch</a> over that eye/general area and has lost all of the hair on his head, and has visible scars on his head and face.

</li><li> Mr. Smith, a villainous CIA agent in the second season generally wears sunglasses which cover the fact that while one his eyes is normal, and is blue, the other is milky white and probably nonfunctional, and has a nasty-looking scar running across it.

This is still a good scar, as it's shown that she received it while saving Yoshimori's life.
<ul><li> And let's not forget Yoshimori himself, whose body is COVERED in little scars all over from his constant physical training and getting tossed around by demons all the time until Tokine can bail him out. All good scars that are generally covered up by his clothes, unless he's wearing shorts or a short-sleeved shirt anyway.
</li><li> Kekkaishi is actually something of a subversion: Tokine and Yoshimori's scars look more realistic, not cool.

Three guesses as to what it's about. And since Lithuania is a good guy, he's able to hide them under his clothes. It's believed that at least some of these scars (which look like whipping marks) come from Russia's abuse, which has been somewhat hinted yet never confirmed in canon.

He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic Hero</a>, so these are Antihero Scars.

Granted, she is about as good a character as it gets, so maybe it's a subversion?
</li><li> There are characters with scars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, but these are 'good guys'. However, their scars are not all attractive. Soul has a massive scar right down his chest after being struck by Ragnarok (the black blood infection this gives him is plot-relevant), though it has not been referred to or seen recently. Stein is covered in scars due to experimenting on himself. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Black Star obtains a clean scar bisecting the star tattoo on his shoulder that symbolizes his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a></span> in the manga. In contrast, most of the main antagonists are not only unscarred but rather good-looking (Medusa, Arachne, Noah isn't exactly ugly in spite of his dress sense and Asura's face is 'pretty-boy' material even if the rest of him is skeletal, skin-stretching squick).
</li><li> Eureka, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EurekaSeven">Eureka Seven</a></em>, suffers "vein" scars which cover half of her left body (including her face) after an incident in episode 19 and remains that way until the final episode whereby her scars are no longer visible on her.
</li><li> The main hero Tetsunosuke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane">Peacemaker Kurogane</a></em> received a scar under his right eye following his battle with Yoshida.

</li><li> Yasuri Shichika, protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari">Katanagatari</a></em>, had his body scarred horribly in the last episode; though he covers most of them up, the one on his face is very prominent. He's virtually the only character in the series to receive such wounds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymores</a></em> are all hideously disfigured with scars beneath their armor, presumably as a result of becoming half-yokai.

We have Yuya, the heroine, who has a hideous scar on her stomach (it gets de-hideoused later on, but still counts as a subversion). Then there's Akira (good guy), who is covered in scars, but they are mostly on his back and almost always covered by clothes. And finally, we get Hishigi (a rather dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>), who is covered in <em>nasty</em> scars after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Devil Eyes that have been keeping him alive are destroyed</span>.

<ul><li> Subverted with Usui Shuusei who is most definitely a very good guy (though a slightly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">broken</a> one). He has some very nasty, discolored and badly-healed burn marks on his upper body from when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> interrupted Hotsuma's suicide attempt</span>.

We're never given a story behind it, but given his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">back</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenocideBackfire">story</a>, it's probably meant to hint at his difficult past.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Brave10">Brave10</a></em>, Kakei has a fashionable scar on his jaw, which Okatsu tries to recreate on the other side while assaulting him. Okatsu has scars, too, but they aren't obvious until she gets comfortable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>:
<ul><li> Inverted by All Might. Despite being a hero, he has horrendous scars on his chest from a fight he got in five years ago <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with All For One</span> that resulted in him losing several of his internal organs. They serve as a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Red Right Hand</a> for him and wouldn't look out of place on a villain.
</li><li> Todoroki has a prominent scald burn over the upper left side of his face, that looks not unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Zuko's</a>, but he's ultimately a good, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">troubled</a> guy.
</li><li> Played straight by Aizawa, Izuku, and Iida, who all gain neat and attractive scars. Aizawa gets one under his right eye during the attack on USJ, Izuku gets two on his right hand during the Sports Festival, and Iida gets one on his left arm during the fight with Stain.
</li><li> Kirishima also has a classic good guy scar in the form of a small cut over his right eye. He received it when his Quirk first manifested as a small child and he accidentally cut himself with his hardening ability while rubbing his eye.
</li><li> Principal Nezu has a large, rugged scar across his right eye, possibly from when he was experimented on by humans in the past. Though he is a Pro Hero and undeniably on the side of good, he does have a sadistic streak and enjoys "toying" with humans when given the opportunity, as he still holds a massive grudge over the abuse he endured from them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VinlandSaga">Vinland Saga</a></em> has multiple examples, as often played straight as not.
<ul><li> While Thorfinn's body is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredInScars">Covered in Scars</a>, his first (and so far only) facial scar is gained during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThresholdGuardian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThresholdGuardian">Threshold Guardian</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fight against Snake</span> that cements him firmly as a good person. The scar is a straight vertical one on his left jaw and cheek, which makes him look more rugged than anything else.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Canute</span> receives a straight horizontal scar on his left cheek from Thorfinn <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the climax of the first arc</span>. Subverted in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the next time he shows up he is sliding down the slippery slope and becoming a much worse person.</span>
</li><li> Averted with Floki, who has a rugged straight scar over his right eye (with the eye fully intact) and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> <em>per excellence</em> and a recurring secondary bad guy for the first third arcs.
</li><li> Thorgil has a split lip. True to this trope, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">just as menacing as it makes him look</a>.
</li><li> Ulf has some clean scarring on his brow, and is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Canute's</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleTopEnforcer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleTopEnforcer">Noble Top Enforcer</a> during the second arc.

<ul><li> The eponymous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheGoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheGoon">The Goon</a></em> has extensive scarring to the left side of his face, although his overhanging cap and the generally shadowy art style tend to mask it

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo">Usagi Yojimbo</a></em>:
<ul><li> Usagi has a curved scar over his left eye. He received it during the battle where he lost his feudal lord and as a result of which he became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ronin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ronin">ronin</a>.
</li><li> Usagi's rival Gennosuke, a rhinoceros, is missing most of his horn after an encounter with the blind pig swordsman Zato-Ino.
</li><li> Zato-Ino himself had his snout cut off in his first appearance, and has used a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">carved wood substitute</a> since.
</li></ul></li><li> John Gaunt, titular character of the series <em>Grim Jack</em>, who had a classic villain scar to highlight his role as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>.
<ul><li> Not to mention that when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">leaves Heaven to inhabit a clone someone else made of him</a>, an explosion later on creates the scar again.
</li><li> Or when he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">is reincarnated as Jim Twilly</a>, he takes a broken glass bottle and scars his own eye, commenting that his face didn't look right.

<ul><li> John Hartigan has a distinctive good-guy scar in his forehead... yep, also in the shape of an "X", whereas the villainous Manute has a horrible glass eye <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to replace the one that Marv ripped out of him in "A Dame to Kill For"</span>.
</li><li> Marv has plenty of his own scars, but he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">bad good guy</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Perhaps the most famous comic book "evil" example is Victor Von Doom. Accounts tend to vary, but the generally accepted story is that the experiment that blew up in his handsome face in his youth only caused a small scar. However, he was so vain that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction">chose to cover it up forever in a steel mask</a>. The ironic thing is that he put the mask on while it was still hot from the forge, which <em>really</em> messed his face up, and made wearing the mask necessary.
</li><li> In issue 200 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>, protagonist John Constantine received a single 'good scar' vertically upward on his left cheek.
</li><li> <em>Classic</em> comic-book example: DC's Harvey Dent (aka "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoFace">Two-Face</a>"), who went psychotic after having acid thrown in his face, resulting in massive and freakishly asymmetrical scarring. Half his face is ruined—and, since he's only evil about half the time, this verges on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>.
<ul><li> His face has been repaired numerous times, almost always resulting in the dominance of the "good" personality. Sometimes he's coincidentally scarred again, resulting in the return of Two-Face; other times, he's unable to keep his dark half at bay and symbolically scars himself when he gives in to his evil impulses. Only once has an unscarred face resulted in the disappearance of the good side.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheDarkKnightReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheDarkKnightReturns">The Dark Knight Returns</a></em> his face is fully restored, but the process destroys the good half of his personality.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Cassandra Cain</a>, the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl2000">Batgirl</a>, has her entire body covered in scars from her assassin father's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">pain-resistance training</a>. This <em>would</em> be a subversion, except that the scars are never actually drawn unless Cassandra is partially or fully undressed. (This happens more often than you would think, but it's okay, she's immune to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a> and is therefore an adult.)
<ul><li> The same can be said for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> himself as he is covered in scars from his many battles, but they are usually only shown when he talks about them or shows them to someone.
</li></ul></li><li> Avoided in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em>: Good guy Ferro Lad's face is so scarred that he wears a mask at all times.
<ul><li> The animated version has another case of good guy with more of a bad-guy sort of scar: Lightning Lad has the scar stopping at his eye and continuing from his eyebrow, ending as a lightning bolt. It glows when he uses his powers. How he got it is unknown, as of the end of Season 1. He's also since lost an arm, having it replaced with an awesome robotic one that can even amplify his powers.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTriganEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTriganEmpire">The Trigan Empire</a></em>, Trigo's simple warrior brother has a very macho bashed-in nose. He is a good guy, but in one story is seduced into evil by the horrible Darak, who has a long scar straight across his eye.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>'s Captain Nazi has a long dueling scar across his face that he's very sensitive about.
<ul><li> As does fellow DC megalomaniac Baron Bedlam.
</li><li> Also from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a> is Lord Havok, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCompanyEquivalent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCompanyEquivalent">Alternate Company Equivalent</a> version of Dr. Doom.
<ul><li> An alternate version of Lord Havok is kind of borderline. Not only are his actions ultimately for the good of mankind, but his deformities (underdeveloped limbs and a disfigured face) are much more pathetic than anything else. However, he hides these disabilities behind a suit of "smart metal" and an impressive array of weaponry. He also utterly destroyed his homeland of Russia... to get back at his father, the Czar, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBadMenLoveTheirMamas">killing his mother</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Inversion: Snake-Eyes, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GIJoe">G.I. Joe</a></em>, is horrifically scarred with burns from a window that exploded from too much heat and pressure inside the vehicle it was on. He wears a mask—not from shame, but practicality (when he doesn't wear it, bystanders tend to stare and not do helpful things like duck out of the way of the crossfire)—and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpeechless">is unable to speak</a>. He's firmly on the good guys' side. Though he's the type of person who can <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">run his girlfriend through with a sword to help her cover</span>, he strives for both honor and morality in his activities.
<ul><li> In the <em>Reloaded</em> continuity, he's got scars all over his body—bullet wounds, burns, massive cuts. He's also reputedly insane.
</li></ul></li><li> Oubliette, the daughter of villain Doctor Midas in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a>'s <em>Marvel Boy</em>, wears a mask to hide her facial scarring; the Evil Scar trope is subverted after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she rebels against Midas, then it's revealed that her face is normal, except for a rather clean fencing scar her father gave her</span>.
</li><li> Jigsaw, one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>'s few recurring foes, is so named because the Punisher threw him face-first through a plate glass window, leaving him with a massive amount of patchwork scars across his face. Making it worse is that he was previously renowned as incredibly handsome.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YTheLastMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YTheLastMan">Y: The Last Man</a></em>: Other Beth has a scar running across the bridge of her nose, presumably an impact injury from her plane crash. And Hero's mastectomy scar is a permanent reminder to her of the atrocities she committed as a Daughter of the Amazon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>: After an infusion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, the cancer that was killing Deadpool was cured... until it came back full force and left his entire body scarred. As a result of his body fighting the cancer off and the cancer coming back, Deadpool's scarred from head to toe—and because his cancer effectively <em>is</em> his healing factor, his exact scars and disfigurements shift and warp. The extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">depends on the artist</a>, ranging from light scratches to discolored patches to full-on tumors (onlookers who don't know what to expect often vomit at the sight of him unmasked). Plus, they work as both since he's somewhere between anti-hero and bad good guy.
<ul><li> Speaking of Deadpool, there's DC's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a> (Slade Wilson, inspiration for the aforementioned DP), missing his right eye which puts him in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Red Right Hand</a> territory.

Maturin acquires serious damage to his hands from French torture (it is implied his fingernails were torn out) that make it harder for him to play his cello, but it got better later on, although only in a relative sense. This is largely omitted in the film adaptation, although Pullings has minor scarring, Midshipman Blakeney has an amputation of one arm, in his role as a composite of several minor characters, and in a reference to the torture, Maturin flexes his fingers before he plays cello.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChungKuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChungKuo">Chung Kuo</a></em>, Gangster boss Whiskers Lu has had half his face scarred by acid.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Harry's famous 'lightning bolt' shaped <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcheyScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcheyScars">achey scar</a>. It's easily covered up by his fringe. A magical quill in the fifth book gives Harry another scar, this one on the back of his hand, the words "I must not tell lies" in his own handwriting, from writing those words, over and over again, in his own blood during detention.
</li><li> In <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, he acquires two new scars <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the same scene: a round one in his chest where Hermione <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShirtlessScene">had to cut out</a> the locket-Horcrux that had stuck to his skin, and two snake-bite marks on his arm</span>.
</li><li> Averted with Alastor "Mad Eye" Moody, a professional fighter of Death Eaters and other Dark wizards, who is heavily scarred and disfigured, including missing a chunk of his nose.
</li><li> Also averted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bill Weasley after he is brutally mauled by werewolf Fenrir Greyback. His face is scarred to the point of resembling Mad-Eye Moody</span>.
</li><li> Similarly averted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">George Weasley when he loses an ear thanks to a Death Eater in the beginning of <em>Deathly Hallows</em></span>.
</li><li> And in a positively whimsical aversion, Dumbledore claims to have a scar above his left knee in the precise shape of a map of the London Underground.
</li></ul></li><li> Mickelson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkyJumpers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkyJumpers">Sky Jumpers</a></em> has a scar that runs down his right temple to his jaw.
</li><li> In the extreme moral ambiguity of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em>, hero and villain scars are sometimes played straight and sometimes subverted:
<ul><li> The ferocious and morally ambiguous Sandor "the Hound" Clegane sports a hideously burned face, which has haunted all his life and turned him into the rage-filled drunkard he is. People generally see him as an inhuman monster, but he subverts his villain scars by revealing his underlying humanity over the course of the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ALighterShadeOfBlack">especially</a> in comparison to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">his older brother</a>, who gave him the scars in the first place.
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister, a deformed dwarf, gets most of his nose cut off by a sword stroke. He was already unfairly hated for his deformities, however, so he thinks of the scar as a bit of a pointless overkill. Everyone assumes that his deformity and scars are proof of his evil nature, and serve to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain">push him from a basically decent and generous soul into what might be a villain</a>.
</li><li> Beric Dondarrion is patchwork of grisly scars - and all of them were fatal wounds (stabbed in the eye, speared through the gut, hanged with a noose), but he has been resurrected from the dead multiple times. Since most people don't know about the resurrections, the scars add onto Beric's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">Shrouded in Myth</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero">Folk Hero</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustLikeRobinHood">Just Like Robin Hood</a> reputation for fighting for the people and being the man the cruel authorities just can't kill.
</li><li> Jon Snow gets cool scars. First he gets his hand burned in a wight attack, forcing him to wear a black glove most of the time. Then he gets his face clawed by a possessed eagle, giving him some cool facial scars that women comment on.
</li><li> Although it's yet to be seen, Littlefinger is said to have a scar on his chest gained during a rather one-sided duel with Brandon Stark for Catelyn's affections, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">marking the beginning of his transition</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a> to a bitter and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">somewhat unhinged</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>.
</li><li> Osney Kettleblack has the typical cool anti-hero scars under his eye, but the origin of them is hardly heroic- he and his brothers were beating up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HookerWithAHeartOfGold">Hooker with a Heart of Gold</a> and she scratched him. Basically, the scars represent how despite his pretensions to being a cool rogue, he's just a thug.
</li></ul></li><li> Luke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em> has one going vertically through his eye
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiseAndFallOfTheSkyValleyCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiseAndFallOfTheSkyValleyCult">The Rise And Fall Of The Sky Valley Cult</a></em>, former pageant queen Syvier has been horribly scarred, and is now an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">assassin</a>. She is later revealed to have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> mutilated her own face to escape the toxic world her parents forced her into</span>.
</li><li> Jason from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a></em> has a little one on his lip from trying to eat a stapler when he was two. Lit, Midas' son and bodyguard is covered in them.
</li><li> Kvothe from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNameOfTheWind">The Name of the Wind</a></em> acquires a variety of scars on his back as a result of not one but <em>two</em> severe whippings over the course of a rather short period of time. It's remarked in the book that they are attractive, pale good-guy-looking scars. All of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">but one</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UrsulaKLeGuin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea">Earthsea</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tehanu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tehanu">Tehanu</a></em>: Therru (good guy) was horribly burned when her natural parents threw her into a fire.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWizardOfEarthsea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWizardOfEarthsea">A Wizard of Earthsea</a></em>, Ged, in a calamitous attempt to summon a long-dead ghost, summons some never-exactly specified evil creature whose first business is to attack Ged and maul one entire side of his face. These scars never leave his face, and so he is reminded every day of his arrogance and the balance that he disrupted.
<ul><li> However, Ged's scars are pretty clearly of the attractive-and-fashionable variety; a young man who sees them thinks them "the track of a dragon's claws and the very mark and sign of a hero."
</li><li> Not necessarily, they're described several times as being fairly severe. Murre (the young man above) is impressed by Ged and is pretty naive at the time that quote comes from. Just because he imagines them to be from some heroic feat doesn't mean they aren't disfiguring; it's pretty clear that they are.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Sort of inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> - Harry gets his hand fried to a crisp by one smarter-than-usual baddy. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because the shade of the fallen angel Lasciel was in his mind, a bit of skin on his palm stayed unburnt, in the shape of her angelic sigil. Definitely evil, but also sort of an antiscar</span>.
<ul><li> As of <em>Turn Coat</em>, he has also acquired the standard anti-hero eye scar thanks to an angry guy with a knife. This is only one of the more visible ones in his (very large) collection, which also features claw marks, bullet wounds, the aforementioned crispy-fried hand, and marks from having been beaten half to death with a chain. Hell, he's probably gotten a couple of new ones in each book, since they more often than not end up with him in the hospital or at the very least lying on the couch in his apartment, hooked up to an IV. No wonder he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">The Woobie</a>.
</li><li> Though Stacy finds them attractive in <em>Small Favor</em>.
</li><li> His hand heals noticeably throughout the books, going from practically crippled to stiff to more or less functional by <em>Changes</em>. Waldo Butters attributes this to a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> which is also responsible for the general long lives of wizards (Harry expects to live to be around 200, unless someone or something kills him off first).
<ul><li> So what you are saying is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero">Harry</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">doesn't actually expect</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">to live to 200</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneHundredYearsOfSolitude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneHundredYearsOfSolitude">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a></em>, Amaranta Buendía horribly burns her own hand in the stove to prove to her mother that she didn't mean to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">drive her first boyfriend Pietro Crespi to kill himself</a>. She covers the scars with a black bandage until the day of her death.
</li><li> Semi-averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LoisMcMasterBujold">Lois McMaster Bujold</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfChalion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCurseOfChalion">The Curse of Chalion</a></em>: good guy Cazaril has both hands permanently damaged by his time as a galley slave, as well as scarring all over his back (hidden by his shirt) from a near-fatal flogging at the tail end of same. However, other characters perceive these as evil scars, since similar floggings are meted out to rapists and paedophiles. This causes him a bit of bother when he has to use a public bathhouse.
</li><li> Also averted in Bujold's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a>. Aral Vorkosigan's L-shaped dueling scar on his cheek adds to his rather thuggish appearance, while his son Miles not only bears an assortment of surgical scars from the piecemeal (emphasis on <em>piece</em>es) replacement of his brittle bones with synthetics but retains one from a needle grenade to the chest that nearly cut him in half. His future wife finds these scars quite a turn on.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels avert it to a breaking point with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIgor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIgor">Igors</a>. While they sport horrible scars and work as henchmen for vampires and werewolves, they are extremely skilled doctors with high professional ethics. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In fact, the scars come from their surprisingly ethical principle of testing every medical novelty upon themselves first.</span> Female Igors—Igorinas—are universally and conventionally beautiful, on the other hand, though they may sport the occasional very fine stitching here and there. It's implied that the reason why they are so beautiful is because Igor surgical skill extends to the field of cosmetic surgery.
<ul><li> Death's granddaughter Susan also has some Good Scars, in the form of three thin, white marks on her cheek that only show up when she's flushed or angry. She inherited them from the slap that her father received from Death.
</li><li> As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Samuel Vimes</span> has a particularly vicious scar running up his face and across his eye. The scar and accompanying eye patch were actually a plot point in that book.
<ul><li> He's pretty scarred up all over from years of chasing guys with names like "Knuckles" across rooftops, something that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rosie Palm</span> brings up while deducing his profession.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em>, 71-Hour Ahmed has a face covered in scars to the point where his beard doesn't grow properly, and Vimes says that there was no way a face like that could be innocent of anything. He is <em>not</em> actually evil, though; he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Klatchian police chief and a counterpart to Vimes</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> novels by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanFleming">Ian Fleming</a>, James Bond is often described as having a scar down his right cheek. However, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">the movies based on the books</a>, this scar had mysteriously vanished. Also, one of the Russians, whose timely intervention against 'Le Chiffre' in the first Bond novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CasinoRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CasinoRoyale">Casino Royale</a></em> saved him from that villain, left him alive but marked him with the Cyrillic letter Ш (the first letter of the word Шпион, meaning 'spy') carved on the back of his right hand, which ended up leaving a scar that the best efforts of plastic surgeons in the employ of MI-6 could not completely eradicate.
<ul><li> Bond <em>villains</em>, on the other hand - along with their henchmen - are the most scarred-up bunch of mofos ever filmed, and Largo's eyepatch is the only one that could pass for remotely heroic. Le Chiffre from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em> might top them all: a dead, milky blue eye that <em>weeps blood</em>, covered by a jagged, livid scar. Right hands don't get much redder than that.
</li></ul></li><li> Father Callahan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> has a cross-shaped scar on his forehead; it was supposed to be a swastika, but the Neo-Nazis carving it were stopped before they could finish.
</li><li> Subversion and played straight at the same time. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the duplicate</span> Thomas Marik is horribly burned across the right side of his body, possibly missing an eye (Artwork seems to vary on this point). However, as a leader he strives for honor and decency, and he is also one of the strongest opponents of the genocidal Word of Blake. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thomas' scars are cosmetic surgery to make him resemble the horribly disfigured <strong>real</strong> Thomas Marik, who is the leader of the Word.</span>
<ul><li> Star Captain Trent also subverts this, as despite being horribly scarred by an Inferno Missile on Tukayyid he is one of the few remaining high ranking Smoke Jaguar warriors who clings to the old ways and tries to remain divorced from the petty politics with the clan, going on to deliver to the Inner Sphere forces the location of the clan homeworlds. Much of the skin on one half of his body (including a large part of his face) has been replaced and is obviously artificial as it is a bit more translucent than normal skin should be.
</li></ul></li><li> Firesong from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HeraldsOfValdemar">Heralds of Valdemar</a></em> series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MercedesLackey">Mercedes Lackey</a> gets seriously burned across his face by a magical explosion. He gets somewhat depressed about it, since he was the most attractive guy in his whole clan before, and wears a mask, but definitely remains a good guy.
</li><li> Lijah Cuu from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a></em> novels has a nasty scar nearly bisecting his face. It "nicely" foreshadows the extent of his treachery.
<ul><li> Ibram Gaunt also bears a multitude of scars from various injuries sustained in the line of duty. A particularly impressive scar runs across his stomach, which he received <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">from his uncle Dercius</span> in a chainsword duel to avenge his father's death.
</li></ul></li><li> Possible subversion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Redwall">Redwall</a></em>; Folgrim in <em>Legend of Luke</em> has a badly scarred face and a missing eye, yet turns out to be a good guy (once he's broken of his rather horrible habit of devouring his enemies - said enemies were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> so the good guys have no problem with <em>killing</em> them, but they still don't think eating them is okay).
</li><li> Scarred heroes in urban fantasy/romance is extremely common. Usually the scars aren't disfiguring and may be a wild turn-on for the scaree's love interest. In J.R. Ward's <em>Black Dagger Brotherhood</em> series, almost every male main character is covered in scars. Zsadist in particular has a nasty <em>S</em>-shaped scar cutting across his face.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em>. In the warren-dictatorship of Efrafa scars are used to identify which 'mark' (section of the warren) you belong to (as the protagonists are rabbits who obviously don't carry identity cards). After his climactic fight with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Bigwig has so many scars it's joked the Efrafans wouldn't know which mark to put him into, as he's got them all.
</li><li> Any number of characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> books are scarred, to differing degrees. The main character (Rand), in fact, recently <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lost a hand</span>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mat has had one of his eyes ripped out Towers of Midnight</span>. The author is also fond of showing a character's battle experience with scars- one even has a missing eye, which he has replaced with a patch painted to show a horrifically scowling eye (and if you make him mad enough, his real eye will match it). Another has a nasty scar around his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManTheyCouldntHang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManTheyCouldntHang">neck</a>, which he covers as best he can with scarves and so on.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner">Nightrunner</a></em> series, good guys Seregil and Micum have scars aplenty, but in places that can be hidden under clothing. By contrast, the evil Duke Mardus has a big scar across his otherwise handsome face.
<ul><li> The scar Seregil gets in the first novel is usually covered by his shirt (and before with a glamour) and becomes a plot point in book two (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Scar</a>?). Even before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> that is to blame for the wound gave him...naasty experiences and also scarred Alec's hand when he removed the thing. Alec had no after effects since the magic pattern of the disk was on the side touching Seregil's skin.
</li><li> Seregil and Alec acquire many more scars in <em>Shadows Return</em>. This trope is also averted there <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when they get their slave marks painfully removed.</span>
</li><li> Beka also acquires several scars "all in the front". Well, since she's a soldier, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>, Micum's daughter and more or less Seregil's "niece"...
</li><li> Princess Klia looses two fingers after a poisoning attack.
</li><li> Tobin from the <em>Tamír Triad</em> has a half moon shaped scar on his chin, acquired when he was a little child <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and Mommy wanted to kill him in a fit of madness. The scar stayed after his transformation</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Doom in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeltoraQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeltoraQuest">Deltora Quest</a></em> series has a grizzled face, complete with a scar across his eye. He's a good guy.
<ul><li> And later on, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lief</span> ends up with scars over a substantial part of his face and neck - such things happen when you have a run-in with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear">Circus of Fear</a> and almost get brainwashed - and he remains the good guy he's always been.

He has three light, curved lines across his face. The narrator describes this as giving the impression of something glass that had been cracked and then stuck back together. While these do count as "Good Scars", they do cause most people to automatically distrust him (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">not that their instincts would be wrong</a>).
</li><li> In P.C. Hodgell's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfTheKencyrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfTheKencyrath">Chronicles of the Kencyrath</a></em>, heroine Jame picks up a classic Good Scar in book 3 (vertical below the left eye).

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines">Mortal Engines</a></em> - Hester's face was sliced in half as a small child, and the enormous, disfiguring scar that resulted (one eye gone, nose destroyed, lips wrenched to one side) tends to horrify people, but... she's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero">mostly</a></em> one of the good guys. However, there's an in-universe example - in Pennyroyal's heavily altered version of events, 'Hester Shaw' has an eye-patch and a 'discreet' scar on her cheek.
<ul><li> Played straight in the film version, where Hester's scar is a lot less grisly.

Tigerstar, another villain, has a scar across the bridge of his nose and a split in his ear. Longtail, a hero, has a V-shaped cut in his ear as well. Of course, one has to take into account that almost every character in existence is scarred somehow, but...

He was a child actor, and in <em>Wraith Squadron</em> is said to be quite attractive if not for the raised, puckered scar that went from his left forehead, across the bridge of his nose, and onto his left cheek. In the numerous disguises he took, he always had to either hide it or incorporate it into the disguise, like when he was masquerading as General Kargin, a pirate with "horrible burn victim makeup". He could have had it removed with a simple, if pricey, bacta treatment, but he thought of it as a reminder of what he'd done - he'd acted for Imperial propaganda, unwittingly helping the cause. After Ton Phanan's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">death</span> and insistence that Face stop punishing the child he'd been, he did have it removed, but for some time wore a fake scar in the same place.

</li><li> Played with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz">Dean Koontz</a>'s Frankenstein series. Deucalion, the original Frankenstein's monster, has horrific scarring across half of his face, as well as the expected patchwork scars. He's a good guy, but he's also <em>Frankenstein's monster</em>, and he is still subject to murderous rages.

</li><li> Played with in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnightAndRogueSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnightAndRogueSeries">Knight and Rogue Series</a></em>. Michael takes the blame for a rather petty incident in the first book to spare a near stranger the punishment and gets flogged as a result, leaving rather graphic scars all over his back. This is no big deal until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's rather unfairly tattooed as an unredeemable criminal</span> at which point everyone sees his scars and assumes they must have been legal punishment for some unspeakably horrid crime.

He gets a prosthetic metal eye in its place, but the scar left over is hideous enough to sicken the most hardened warriors. The torture he goes through makes him one of the cruelest characters in the series during The Heroes, which is quite the competition</span>.
</li><li> A young Vlad the Impaler in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CountAndCountess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CountAndCountess">Count and Countess</a></em> sustains heavy wounds on his throat and loses part of his ear.

When Qui-Gon attacked Xanatos's father he cut the man's hand and put a notch into a ring he wore. Xanatos <em>pressed that ring into his face</em>, deliberately creating this scar.
</li><li> Pity of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SinisterSixTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SinisterSixTrilogy">Sinister Six Trilogy</a></em> has scars running down her cheeks, but this was done intentionally by The Gentleman to make her look more helpless and vulnerable.

Orells eagle, warged by Orwell, proceeds to claw and peck Jon's face and attempts (but fails) to take an eye.

Nina's scars are on her forearm (also several long scratches), so they can be covered by clothes, though not as conveniently.

</li><li> In the prequel, <em>Birth by Sleep</em>, Eraqus, the heroes' mentor, has scars on his eyebrow and cheek. He's about as scarred as Xigbar, but, being a hero, his scars are light. And speaking of Xigbar, we see how he got his scars in the game.
</li><li> Squall and Seifer also show up, and their scars still match despite the fact that they have no connection in this universe.

Contrast his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rival</a> antagonist Krauser, who already has several scars along his face and lips.
<ul><li> And then Krauser gets another one straight across his chest after a lengthy knife fight with Leon.
</li><li> Jake Muller of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em> has a long, but otherwise clean scar going down his left cheek towards his neck.
</li><li> In her epilogue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em>, Ada Wong, the series' resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">morally ambiguous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a>, is shown to have a long, straight, and apparently deep scar stretching along the right side of her ribcage. However, no mention of the scar has been made since.
</li><li> Due to a device being forcibly ripped off of her, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jill Valentine</span> gets an unusual burn-like scar with pin pricks on her chest, courtesy of a boss fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>. It presumably remains there.

</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> universe, Sagat (a morally ambiguous fighter, but usually either the final or penultimate fight) has both a missing eye and a giant scar on his chest, the latter of which Ryu, his rival, gave him with his signature Shoryuken. Although he's presented as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrogantKungFuGuy">Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy</a>, oddly enough), his boss status means that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedVillain">Designated Villain</a>.
<ul><li> He <em>did</em>, however, kill Dan's father. And he works for Bison...
<ul><li> Note that in the case of Dan's dad... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">according to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a>, Sagat killed Go Hibiki because he ripped his eye off during a fight, which sent Sagat into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>. Sagat was <em>not</em> happy when he calmed down and found out</span>. And about Bison, it's also retconned into him being more confused, misguided, and <em>extremely</em> pissed off, rather than evil and fully converted to Bison's cause.
</li><li> In addition, he made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, choosing to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil">Rival Turned Evil</a>, way back in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Alpha</a></em>, which retconned his appearance in SFII as not actually working for Bison after all. Going back to Dan's dad, Dan coming after Sagat for revenge was what caused him to realize his hatred was destroying him and led him to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> On the good scar side, Cammy's manages to make an overly muscular woman downright <em>adorable</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuskyRusskie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuskyRusskie">Ah, comrade!!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Zangief</a> will be the first to tell you that no scars are as good as those earned when wrestling bears for Mother Russia!

<ul><li> Ont of the most over-the-top examples is Darth Sion (appropriately called the Lord of Pain). Early in the game, a medical officer reports several THOUSAND fractures in his skeleton. Combined with that creepy music and the general dark nature of the game, it'll send chills down your spine. Doubly creepy later on when it becomes obvious that these injuries and scars are all self-inflicted; it's implied that Sion has mastered using pain as a source of power the way most Sith Lords use anger and passion; it would seem to work, he's effectively immortal unless <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">someone convinces him that letting go and allowing his body to die is preferable to his existence</span>.
</li><li> Darth Malak wears a metal mask for most of the game, concealing the lower half of his face. When he's finally shown without it, it's more horrifying than any simple scar could be. It's not that he hides something underneath it, it's what <em>isn't</em> there - he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">missing the entire jaw</a>...
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>: the player can create a character with scars that range anywhere from tiny and stylish to monstrous gashes, and their character's alignment is up to the player.
<ul><li> Interestingly, no matter what background you select for Shepard, the manner in which you got that scar is never addressed.
</li><li> The sequel has a great deal of fun with this. First Mordin has a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMarksTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMarksTheHero">X-shaped</a> scar and is missing the tip of one of his cranial horns, then Garrus gets some facial injuries that become evil-looking scars during your initial encounter with him, although he's a good guy. Even Commander Shepard him/herself falls to this: you get small facial scars at the start of the game, and you actions determine what happens. Doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Para</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MessianicArchetype">gon</a> actions will make the scars look a lot softer to the point where they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">disappear completely</a>. Doing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Rene</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">gade</a> actions will cause some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">gnarly looking evil scars, eventually becoming massive burns</a> and your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">eyes will turn red</a>!
</li><li> Jack also has some scars mixed in along with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TattooedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TattooedCrook">tattoos</a>. From the <a class="urllink" href="http://i46.tinypic.com/2q3usqr.jpg">precision and locations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, they appear to be surgical scars from her time at the Teltin facility.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Wrex</a> has a series of scars on the right side of his face that make him look evil, fitting his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a> status of the first game as a bloodthirsty mercenary. If he survives the first game, he becomes a full on good guy leading his race to a brighter future.
</li><li> Mostly averted by Kaidan. Despite having undergone a series of painful and slightly traumatic operations in order to receive his (dangerously outdated) L2 implants, and being an active long-term member of the Alliance military, he of all people would be expected to sport numerous scars of various types, but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/annakie/4396434255/sizes/l/">the few he has<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are only noticeable under certain lighting conditions if your graphics are set to maximum. Though Thane claims that he was able to recognize Kaidan as a biotic immediately due to his implant scars, so they seem to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedDeformity">invisible only to the player</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">The lack of combat scars makes sense</a> considering he's both a biotic and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatMedic">field medic</a>. In the rare case when something did get through his barriers, he'd know how to treat his injuries to keep scarring from becoming an issue.

</li><li> This is a bit of a weird example because they're not an organic being, but your geth teammate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindHive">Legion</a> was left with a large chunk of their chest missing after being shot by a panicky human who assumed he was one of the "heretic" geth. They patched it up (slightly) with a piece of Shepard's old armor. The large chunk of black armour with the N7 markings also serve to distinguish them from other Geth platforms.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> candidate Admiral Hacket has a collection of facial scars that hint at his service record.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em>, teammate Jaal Amal Darav comes with a visible gash on the left side of his face (the reason for which is never given). Depending on the player's choices, he may well end up with a small scar on his right cheek at the end of his loyalty mission.

<ul><li> Also, there's Hector's brother, Uther, with a scar across his forehead and another one across his nose. Black Fang's Legault has a double scar across his left eye, and Brendan Reed has dozens of them on his face alone. In contrast, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, Nergal, has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a bunch of really nasty burns all around his eye, which he hides with a turban</span>.

In particular, Keldorn and Imoen sport the "over the eye" scar that should be all but impossible without putting the eye out. These can be said to be symbolic—Keldorn, the grizzled veteran; and Imoen, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePollyanna">innocent youth</a> having learned the world isn't as nice as she'd like.
</li><li> Rikimaru, playing character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tenchu">Tenchu</a></em>, sports a scar over the right eye.

Early on in the series, he gives his childhood friend Hassan one to match whilst suffering from cabin fever and copious amounts of guilt.

In a sparring match gone bad, a grenade goes off very close to his face, blinding him in one eye and giving him some serious scars on that side of his face. Despite the extent of his injuries, he's still a good guy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> uses the good version, with Weiss having a small, crooked scar over her left eye. This type of scar, however, is more associated with anti-heroes; Weiss is the spoiled heiress of a company with shady business practices, but she's learning how to put others first and her dream is to restore her family honour. It starts to fade as the series proceeds.

</li><li> General Ironwood has a small metal plate above his right eyebrow and he's later revealed to have extensive cybernetics and what looks like nasty burn scarring where the metal meets his flesh. The combination of good and bad scars fits his role in the story as a well-intentioned but misguided good guy who is letting his paranoia get the better of him and inadvertently playing into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s hands.

<ul><li> Skoll is the most obvious example of it being played straight, she is ruthless and for all intents and purposes evil, she has a large scar across her cheek, nose, and eyebrow that cuts out a chunk of the bridge of her nose, she has scars on her neck, abdomen, and legs, and a burn that takes up most of her back. Faustus, one of the antagonists is missing his left eye, he is badly burned and has gaping wounds on his chest, and is missing his left arm. (he got better)
</li><li> Hait and Karcharoth avert this. Karcharoth is almost as evil as Skoll, yet only has a few scratches on his neck, and a single scar over his left eye. Hati who is considered good has large scars across her forearms and back.

It's subverted here, because the scar is very nasty to look at.
</li><li> Vaelia, a female gladiator from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales">Drowtales</a></em> has a three-clawed, down-from-the-eye scar.
</li><li> Kahn from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EVIL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EVIL">EVIL</a></em> has one of the variety that goes over his left eye but leaves the eyeball itself intact.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em> makes a point of both trope and subversion. Constructs (created or repaired humans) have permanent 'Frankenstein' stitchery all over their bodies. Agatha's foster parents Adam 'Punch' Clay and Lilith 'Judy' Clay, and Baron Wulfenbach all have these prominent scars (good guys), but so does R-79, one of the dangerous-looking prisoners sent to Castle Heterodyne (bad guy). Another Castle prisoner, nicknamed 'Cucaracha', has the 'evil' false-harelip sort of scar, but <em>he</em> gets beat up by the girl in the pink dress.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins">Goblins</a></em>, Thaco is missing an ear. This is explained to be from an encounter with the psychotic Dellyn Goblinslayer, who cut it off and took it as a trophy before Thaco escaped.
</li><li> Peggy the sniper from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GrrlPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GrrlPower">Grrl Power</a></em> has the "cross over the eye and nose" sort AND a prosthetic lower leg. Watch out for continuity errors regarding the leg!

</li><li> Amethyst Lashiec from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Heartcore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Heartcore">Heartcore</a></em> has big red scars on her cheeks and forearms, inflicted upon her by her father Royce.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>, black and white royals had scars over their eyes as a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">a sylladex accident with a harlequin</a>. The only remaining after serial regicide and impromptu abdications is usurper unmistakably evil Jack Noir, whose counterpart Spade Slick has a coincidental matching scar over his eye. And then there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Monster Clown</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMutilationDemonstration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMutilationDemonstration">carved his own face with his attacker's weapon</a>.
</li><li> Grey from <em>Inhuman</em> almost has more scars than regular skin on his body. The main reason it's just ALMOST is because his face is almost unscarred... aside from a huge scar over the bridge of his nose, which admittedly does make for the "cute but deadly" look.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LastRes0rt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LastRes0rt">Last Res0rt</a></em> has two:
<ul><li> Subverted/Ambiguous: Daisy Archanis has an Artificial Leg. While Daisy's shown in the comic itself to be a relatively clever protagonist (not to mention a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan">Rain Woman</a>), Jason (and the media) think she's evil, and whatever it is she's supposedly plea-bargained her way out of in exchange for playing on the show is Morally Ambiguous at best. Of course, the artificial leg IS a recent acquisition...
</li><li> Played Straight: Arikos's scarred and blinded eye, earned just after his arrest when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">one of his children scars him up to prevent him from using any powers gained from running the cult he engineered as a ploy to have said children</a>. Apparently charisma is a big component of Celeste magic.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MinionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MinionComics">Minion Comics</a></em> the primary evil villain, Von Gernsbach, has a face covered in sinister-looking scar tissue.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Misfile">Misfile</a></em>, Xaphrael has a large scar up the side of his face and crossing his eye. This type of scar can be good or bad, so let's check the tropes: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">Hammy entrance</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrypticConversation">Cryptic and vaguely threatening conversation</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">concealment of a crime that he has the main characters bang to rights on</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenAgendaVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenAgendaVillain">evasion of direct questions</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">threatening to choke to death</a> the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a> using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASinisterClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASinisterClue">left hand</a>. Yep, those would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">evil scars</a>.
</li><li> Agent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredWithScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredWithScars">250</a> from <em>Webcomic/{Niels}}</em> plays with this: he has scars across his face, entire upper body and on both legs, the two most recent being from getting hit in the knee with shrapnel and being shot in the gut at point-blank range. However, he is one of the good guys, being an agent for a secret government law enforcement agency. His role falls into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft">Good Is Not Soft</a>, as his missions usually involve infiltration and combat that would put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">John McClane</a> to shame. The scars also do nothing to detract from his physical appeal, as he has an ongoing relationship with his coworker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock">Agent 300</a>.
</li><li> Ballister Blackheart from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Nimona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Nimona">Nimona</a></em> has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Heroic</a> vertical scar over one eye, but also a villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">prosthetic arm</a>, because he's really more of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> sort of dude. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a> (turned regular old good guy by the end) Goldenloin gets some giant scars on his face in a fight with the eponymous character, averting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsNeverTarnished" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsNeverTarnished">Beauty Is Never Tarnished</a> because <em>damn</em> was he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">pretty</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em>:
<ul><li> O'Chul has a scar running down across his eye. The x-ray effect of a Disintegrate spell reveals the cut left a mark on the bone of his skull as well. He might be somewhat of a subversion, as he has lots of ugly, raised scars, which makes sense, as he was held prisoner and tortured for months.
</li><li> Also, in <em>Start Of Darkness</em>, Right-Eye has a large, jagged scar across his face which he got when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">eye was stabbed out by a paladin</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Pacificators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Pacificators">Pacificators</a></em>, Commander Bismun has a few on his face — one of them being the classic X-shaped scar — and he gains a fourth later on. The pirate Ferdinand, however, subverts the Bad Guy scar by having a neat little line on his cheek. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Also, Muneca is <em>absolutely covered</em> with mottled, terrible burn scars, subverting the Good Girl scars.</span>
</li><li> Milny from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PlanescapeSurvivalGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/PlanescapeSurvivalGuide">Planescape Survival Guide</a></em> recently gained several. The most noticeable is a crosscut sword slash starting from her left cheek, across the nose, and through the right eyebrow. The next biggest is a gunshot wound just above her left breast. Both are generally of the non-disfiguring variety.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Plume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Plume">Plume</a></em>, the villain Dom has a scar across his eye from the day <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vesper's dad shot him</span>, although it gives him more of a roguish charm befitting his personality and the twists of the story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent">Questionable Content</a></em>, Faye has a scar on her right breast that was the result of a car accident <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that may or may not have been intentional.</span>
</li><li> Subverted (probably) by Hakelda in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Reliquary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Reliquary">Reliquary</a></em>, who has rather nasty-looking scars disfiguring her left side (including the face), but who seems to be the sweetest of the cast so far.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SecondLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SecondLeague">Second League</a></em>, She-Man (a good guy) and Ana (a villain) have near-identical scars on their faces.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shadowgirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shadowgirls">Shadowgirls</a></em>, a Slaad got the drop on Becka, slashing her back. This has left three parallel scars on her lower back, which is even retained in her shadowform, and the fused Shadowchild. They even appear on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMerch">Shadowchild figure</a>! Also, Lindsey's battle with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a non-sparkling vampire</span> left her with a scar on her left cheek.
</li><li> Kharisma Valetti of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SomethingPositive">Something*Positive</a></em> has burn scars that left her face with large darkened patches. Not so much good or evil as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheWaterPhoenixKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheWaterPhoenixKing">The Water Phoenix King</a></em>, as there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenHero">never any question as to his Alignment</a>, but Gilgam's triple scar (it looks like he was clawed by a wildcat — we eventually learn what really did it) <em>quite</em> disfiguring, really disturbing and wince-inducing at first, although one eventually gets used to it and almost stops noticing it until something happens to point out again just how close he came to losing that eye. (It's shocking how young he looks in the flashbacks before he got it.) He's still quite handsome, but it's despite, not because of. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcheyScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcheyScars">doesn't seem to bother him at all now</a>, either.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WeakHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/WeakHero">Weak Hero</a></em>, the protagonist-aligned Alex has a large scar across the bridge of his nose that marks him as a delinquent without sacrificing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">his good looks</a>. He's shown with a bandage there before entering middle school, implying that's the timeframe that he earned the scar, but the details of it haven't been revealed.

<ul><li> Zuko's scar is such a big part of his character that he's both completely unrecognizable and pretty unremarkable <a class="urllink" href="http://piandao.org/screenshots/earth/earth18/earth18-752.jpg">without it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, as seen in his dream sequence in "The Earth King".
</li><li> Later Aang gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both a scar on his back and foot from being hit by Azula's lightning bolt</span>.
</li><li> Even later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zuko gets <em>another</em> scar on his chest from a partially screwed-up lightning re-direction when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a></span>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Jeong-Jeong</a> (who deserted from the Fire Nation army when he realized just how much harm it was causing) also has scars across his eye.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>: Chief Bei Fong, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffspring">Toph's daughter</a> and head of the Republic City <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraOreDinary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraOreDinary">metalbending police force</a>, has two thin scars resembling claw marks on her right cheek. Despite some initial trouble, it's a "good" scar, which only makes her look badass and in no way takes away from her attractiveness. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They're courtesy of her attempt to arrest her sister.</span>
<ul><li> The reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Amon</a> wears a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaskOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMaskOfDoom">White Mask of Doom</a> is ostensibly because his face was horribly scarred after a Firebender attacked him and his family in his youth. When <a class="urllink" href="http://media.animevice.com/uploads/1/11372/552868-k23.png">eventually seen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> it looks pretty evil, drawing his face into a permanent scowling grimace. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's also a fake, caused by a heavy makeup job, in the event that he ever needed to weather accusations of falsehood.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnlightenedAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnlightenedAntagonist">Zaheer</a>, Book 3's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, has several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuggedScar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuggedScar">Rugged Scars</a> (a cross-shaped one on the back of his head and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonMomoa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonMomoa">Jason Momoa</a>-esque split eyebrow), likely both to underscore his status as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpoweredBadassNormal">Empowered Badass Normal</a> <em>and</em> to make him look intimidating. The ambiguity suits him: while he's a serious threat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(almost managing to kill Korra outright)</span> during the story arc in which he primarily features, he's also ultimately an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a><span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">, and willingly <em>helps</em> her in his final appearance on the show</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">General Reginald Peter Skarr</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EvilConCarne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EvilConCarne">Evil Con Carne</a></em> has the standard lightning-bolt 'evil' kind coming down from his right eye. Oddly enough, unlike most versions of this trope, he is actually blind in that eye. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">According to the 'blink-and-you'll-miss-it' text in the opening credits</a>, he got the scar from running with scissors.
</li><li> Lightning Lad from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegionOfSuperHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegionOfSuperHeroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a></em> had a lightning bolt scar under one eye that occasionally flashed when he used his powers (lightning, naturally)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a></em> good guy Hudson has a long scar down his face. His is particularly striking in that gargoyles wouldn't normally scar, as they heal each night when they enter stone sleep. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hudson's scar was given to him by the Archmage, making it magical damage, thus likely why it did not heal—though it could also be that if such maiming damage "settles" it might not heal properly.</span>
<ul><li> On the other hand, the original (and villainous) Hunter, Gillecomgain, had three scars across his face, and while most Hunters of future generations are not so badly scarred, the masks they wear pay homage to their progenitor.
</li></ul></li><li> Enzo/Matrix from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em> gets a scar across his left eye in his final Game cube as a kid. When the next season starts up, he and his companions have aged up via localized timeskip-the eye has been replaced with a bitchin' gold-colored cybernetic replacement, but the across-the-eye scar still remains. Matrix is very much an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>.
</li><li> Dr. Blight from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainPlanetAndThePlaneteers">Captain Planet</a></em> looks perfectly normal (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">and in fact hot</a>)... until she moves the fringe covering the side of her face, revealing a severely scarred face.
</li><li> Given that Transformers can be repaired perfectly even if they're missing large parts of their body, scars are pretty unnecessary. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersArmada">Transformers Armada</a></em> Wheeljack retains the long scar across his Autobot symbol from the accident that led to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. However, it's also possible he made the scar himself <em>after</em> the accident, so it might not count.
<ul><li> Ratchet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> also left the chevron on his forehead broken after his battle with Lockdown, most likely for personal symbolic reasons.
</li><li> Ironhide from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> film series has a scar over his right eye.
<ul><li> Also in the movie continuity, there's <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Image:ROS5-Strongarm.jpg">Strongarm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (from the IDW comics) who has three HUGE slashes across his face (which is sometimes covered up by a face mask). Apparently he was involved in a Decepticon attack that left his entire unit dead and whilst the scars could be repaired, he chose to keep them as a reminder to the Autobots who died under his command.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment of the Season 3 premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>, we see that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charles Ofdensen now has one, from when the Metal Masked Assassin deliberately cut his face in Season 2</span>.
<ul><li> After that episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the scar seems to have disappeared</span>. Brendon Small claimed that there is a reason for this.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight and subverted by <em>several</em> characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeRenegades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GIJoeRenegades">G.I.

He had become a mercenary, not fighting for either side, until Jesus asked him to help rescue Francine from the Anti-Christ. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathEqualsRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathEqualsRedemption">Death Equals Redemption</a>, he goes to his personal Heaven, which brings him back to Earth at the beginning of the episode.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, Sadie gets a small scar on her cheek after getting attacked by a big fish in "Island Adventure". While it fades over time, it's still visible if you look hard enough. Seasons later, Lars gets a big scar over his eye after he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> gets blown up by a Robonoid</span>.

Shortly after Throttle, Vinnie, and Modo originally left Mars, she got a thin scar just below her left eye, but her main concern is the survival of Mars, so she's still an ally of the Biker Mice for the most part.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">Shiro</a> has one over the bridge of his nose that he got while a Galra prisoner.
